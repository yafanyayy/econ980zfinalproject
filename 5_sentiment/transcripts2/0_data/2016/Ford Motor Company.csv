Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I am really pleased review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered",798,"Okay, thanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I am really pleased review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion. Looking at the business units, every business unit, with the exception of South America, was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability and we earned over a quarter of $1 billion, and that reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific has its best ever annual profit. And of course, North America and Ford Credit continued to deliver strong profitability for the company. We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years, and our Automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8% and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in Automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion and that was the best that we generated since 2001. We also, at the same time, grew our global market share, and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products. A little bit of sampling of that, Explorer remains the best-selling 3-row SUV in the world; Mustang, which as you know we took global last year, is the world's best-selling sports car; F-Series is America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 years in a row. We are also again America's best-selling vehicle brand for the sixth straight year. And in Europe, we became the #1 commercial vehicle brand, and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years. And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight year of U.S. sales growth and we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation. And of course, along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 billion during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders. 
Looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago. Our net income came in at $1.9 billion and our Automotive operating margin came in at 6.1%, and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong top line growth, with our wholesale volume and automotive revenue both up 12%, and revenue was up 18% at constant exchange and we generated strong automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter. We were profitable in all business units except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations. And in Europe, we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter. 
So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved, delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders. And we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year. 
Now turning to Slide 4, 2015 was also year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned. We improved quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products, and we continue to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all of our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near-term while expanding our business model for the future. And we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company. And what this means is we are strengthening and investing in our core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles, but also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle touch fleet in the industry. And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of Ford Pass. And as we do all of this, we are going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our One Ford plan, delivering product excellence with passion in every part of the business. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob who will take us through some of the financial results"

What I'd like to do is to turn on Slide 5, which is our key financial summary, and the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth column, so it's the year-over-year for the fourth quarter in the full year",1716,"Thanks, Mark. What I'd like to do is to turn on Slide 5, which is our key financial summary, and the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth column, so it's the year-over-year for the fourth quarter in the full year and what you'll see us everything is positive. So whether it's the growth factor, the operating results, the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015 whether it's the quarter or the full year. We certainly wish to recognize that -- and we'll talk about it later in the presentation, that we're seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business. In fact, all parts of the business in terms of the full year and wish to recognize, too, that we're benefiting from the big bet that we made on the F-150. We have the launch effects of that in 2014 and including in the fourth quarter, that was a big bet for the company and it's paying off for us. It's certainly resonating with the customers, it's good for the environment and certainly as I have said we are reaping the rewards of that. 
Let me just touch and most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides. I just want to highlight 3 things that I won't come back to later. The first down the page on operating results, it looks like earnings per share on operating basis, you can see that we came in at $0.58 which is up 93% from a year ago and $1.93 which is up 44%. Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income. You can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion, that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year, of $6.1 billion. If you go up just a couple of lines from there, you can see the special items, pretax charges in the quarter. We have $714 million that was almost completely explained by the remeasurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans. 
Let's go on to Slide 6. I've got 3 slides for the full year. I'd like to touch on those first and then we'll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter, and you can see the record of $10.8 million, and then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything that was profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America. And if you look at the operations outside of North America, collectively, we made $223 million. To me the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis. If you look below the chart, you can see the changes, the $3.57 billion improvement at the company level, it was driven by North America, $1.9 billion, of Financial Services, a contributor over $200 million; but we got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside North America. And going forward, our whole strategy is to keep North America strong to the extent that we can. But it's really the other operations. We need to get them moving forward in a positive direction, both in terms of profitability and returns. That's the big opportunity for us, as well as the new opportunities. And you can see we made great progress on that in the full year, and I'll touch on that in the quarter as well. 
Let's turn now to Slide 7, and here we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the Automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page, wholesale's up 5%; revenue up 4%; 9% at constant exchange, very strong improvement at the operating margin, 6.8% and the pretax results of 60%. And on the lower left, you can see the global market share which was us 2/10 [ph] that was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix affects as well. 
Let's go on to Slide 8 and here we look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement in market factors, volume, mix, net pricing, all driving that into positive direction. We did have cost increases, both contribution costs and structural cost. The one thing I'd like to highlight here, we have broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately and you can see with the manufacturing callout that we've also indicated that it includes volume-related effects. Some companies include variable and little [ph] overhead in volume, so we don't do that. We put all of that and structural cost which is why we don't call it fixed costs because you recognize that the downturn, we're able to respond appropriately whether it's taking over time, out, shares, shift changes and so forth. So, hopefully, that will help you understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business. On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all that sits in North America. We've got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement. Most of that is the onetime ratification bonus. The rest of it this just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth, and that's sitting in our structural cost. 
Now, let's move into the fourth quarter. I'll start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9. Again, very strong performance, $2.6 billion, and again, glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and again, the collected results of the operations outside North America, a profit of nearly $300 million. Again, I want to highlight the story year-over-year. Go below the chart, first line, $1.3 billion, $400 million for North America but $130 million from Financial Services. But more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again, demonstrating the progress that we're making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world. 
Now let's move to the key metrics on Slide 10. Again, growth in wholesales, double digits, same thing in revenue up 18% in constant exchange. A good margin for the fourth quarter, 6.1% and pretax results that more than doubled. And on the lower left you can see global market share was flat. 
Let's go on to Slide 11, and here we'll look at the change in our automotive sector results year-over-year, up $1.1 billion. Very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We have cost increases, again, look at the structural costs you can see the manufacturing of $235 million, almost all of that is volume-related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and the ratification bonus to the far right. 
Okay, let's go onto North America. And here we'll start going to the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter, it was their best quarter of growth for the year. You can see wholesale's up 15%, revenue up nearly 20%, the operating margin, very, very good at 8.2%, traditionally fourth quarter is our weakest quarter, and this includes the full $600 million of UAW-related costs. So really strong results from North America. And you can see the profit, $2.1 billion -- $2 billion of 26%. If you go below the chart, you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the board, and again, the margin came in at 10.2%. As we look at the guidance for the year, we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins, about around where we actually ended up about 9.5% or higher. I thought I'd comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance. Let me just, again, put into context how we're seeing North America business. It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins. And as you mentioned, in 3 of the last 4 years, other than the year when we launched the F-150, it's been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high-end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%. In 2016, we expect the margins again to be sort of in this range, 9.5% or higher, but unlike in 2015 when they year-over-year growth in the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth. And this is reflecting mainly 3 factors. The first is the fact that we'll see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we are expecting the impact of the launch which takes place in the second half to have an impact. We've told it's a normal launch, but it's still going to incur costs associated with such a large launch and we're going to have the normal volume ramp-up curve that we have to climb, so we'll have an effect primarily in the third quarter. And as mentioned, lastly we're continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond, not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transform Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that's how we see it. We're very pleased with the results, we're going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016. 
Okay, let's go to the following slide, on Slide 13, and let's look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million, strong market factors. Our cost increasing related to the products which also drove the market factors but also the structural costs which were largely volume-related and the UAW agreement with the ratification bonus also having an effect which is over and other."

There's a lot of very big macro trends that are sweeping across the global economy and certainly the strong dollar commodity, weak commodity cycle is one. There's probably no region that's more affected by this",654,"Let's turn now to South America on Slide 14. There's a lot of very big macro trends that are sweeping across the global economy and certainly the strong dollar commodity, weak commodity cycle is one. There's probably no region that's more affected by this then South America. And you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. You can see the wholesales were down sharply 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%, about 45% of that was related to weaker currencies. Margin, of course, down sharply and the results were down as well. If you look at the fourth quarter, the same story, but when you get to the full year, you can see that we actually had an improvement in the results and that was related to the fact that we have the non-repeat of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014. In terms of guidance, as we mentioned, we expect our guidance for that region as that it will be a loss in 2016, and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015. 
Okay, let's move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million. And if you look at the callout box on volume and mix, you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline. We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter, having an impact on the business. But I will tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We have strong pricing, we have very favorable results in terms of cost performance and I would highlight that within this positive cause factors, we have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and Argentina. And then lastly, I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso that came towards the end of the year as the new government started taking action to restructure the economy. So it's good for the longer-term of Argentina, but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter. 
Okay, let's turn to Europe now, which is a very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] that's the third consecutive quarter of profitability. We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe and in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% in wholesales, up 19% if you hold exchange constant, and of course, return to profitability with a positive margin. And the story on the full year basis is just as good. We had growth although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange. It was actually up 8%, of course, of the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million. Now if you look on the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up 6/10 of a point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also have favorable market share among the Europe 20 [ph] and that was driven by the good performance of the Mondeo and the Ecosport. In terms of guidance for 2016, we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015. 
Let's turn to Slide 17, and here we look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe. So up $428 million and going across the page, most everything positive. We have favorable volume and mix, we had higher net pricing, we had lower cost. And if you go to the far right, the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford [indiscernible] in Russia. So really, really strong performance right across the board in Europe."

As we move into 2016, we expect the results to be about the same, if not better, in Middle East and Africa. 
All right, going to Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific, great story here. Wholesales were up sharply 16%, the revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange, a very strong operating margin and the record pretax result in the quarter. If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year, similar story, not quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearly the big quarter of growth in 2015. Very strong margin of over 7% and that record profit that we talked about earlier. On the lower left, you can see the share in China was flat, but we did improve the share overall across the region and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix. In terms of guidance, we're expecting results in 2016 to be even better than they were in 2015. 
Let's go to Slide 20, and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific which was quite strong, $349 million was largely driven by volume and mix. And you can see it was industry, a bit of share which is again geographic mix, [indiscernible] the industry grew and we also got new products into the pipeline and mix was very, very strong. Within this mix and other of $181 million, you actually have $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge which is hot and high-margin as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga And then you can see that the costs were pretty much flat. And over at the far right, you can see Other. That is largely the royalties in China, so volume-related as well. So very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016."

They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter 2015, although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half. But just a note to point out that as you know, the Chinese new year is very variable. Some years, it falls in January, some years it falls in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clear view of how the industry is tracking."

We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations. On the far left you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported Ford's growth overall. Pretax results of 5 56 that, that was up 31% and then we got [indiscernible] which just represent the portfolio performance which continues to be very strong and very robust. And for those of you who want to understand more, of course you can call into the fixed income call, which takes place later today and the team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance. But the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and, in fact, registry, low levels. If you look at the data below the chart, again, growth across the board there, whether it's volume or managed receivables of the profit it's $2.1 billion. And again, look at those portfolio performance metrics all looking quite good. And this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase policies. It's been implementing those we're consistently for a number of years. So for example in terms of high risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of portfolio and it's performing very well as the data indicates. 
What I want to highlight on the left, and I'm not going to talk about it until we get to the next slide. But look at the debt, $120 million to support Ford Credit and the managed leverage of 9.5 to one we target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of the United States. In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be a strong performer, about the same, if not better, in 2016 than it was in 2015. 
Now let's turn to Slide 22 and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance. Ford Credit. You can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the globe in terms of the products and services that it provides and favorable financing margin which came from lower borrowing costs. 
With that, let's go onto Slide 23 and we'll look at Automotive sector cash and cash flow. These are really the great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about 1/3 down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of automotive operating related cash flow in the quarter driven by the  profits, and if you look at the full year, $7.3 billion record of lease of 2001, again driven by the very strong profits. And then you can see the uses of the cash flow below that. On the lower left you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level, and then the Automotive debt of $12.8 billion. I just want to stop right here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we've seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company, and generally that point of view is that people are taking this automotive debt, they are adding it to the Financial Services debt, which is on the previous page and of course, the business would look pretty higher leverage but that's not the way that investors should look at it. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self-funding. Ford Credit also self liquidates in a downturn and lower volume. And so you think about Ford Credit separately and then in terms of its own leverage, you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on. And as I mentioned, we've historically, been within the 8% to 9% we target, a little bit above because of the translation effect in '15, but we're going to go back into range in 2016. The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and one that the credit rating agencies look at is this, what's on this page, the $12.8 million [ph] and this is the lowest it's been since 2000. And it is representative of their good leverage position with the company along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. So we're in a great shape in terms of the balance sheet, but I just want to clarify that for everyone if you have any questions about that. 
Okay. I'm going to wrap up on Slide 24 and this is looking at the planning assumptions, the key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year. All I'll say is we delivered. If you go to the very bottom of the slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax 5 year average return on invested capital. We came in at 16% 2015, which was unchanged from 2014. And in both years, well above the cost of capital. 
So Mark, back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up."

So as you go on Slide 25 here, you can see the company guidance is unchanged from the outlook that we provided on January 12. And we expect 2016 to be another strong year for the company, one that features obviously sustained strong financial performance and returns, profitability across all parts of the business, except South America, a continued strong balance sheet and of course, the next stage in the deployment of our shareholder distribution strategy. Now as always, for our process, we're going to continue to monitor the business environment to anticipate or react to any changes that we see and take appropriate action. 
So to sum it up, before we get to the Q&A, we promised and we delivered on our commitments for 2015. We promise to restructure and invest in our operations around the world, and we delivered in both top line and bottom line growth. And this year, our commitment is to accelerate our pace of progress even further by building on our strengths, but also we're growing lean. We're going to be focusing, obviously, on profitability and making tough choices to restructure where necessary. We're moving fast to expand our business model, and we're on track to deliver both our near and our long-term strategic objectives. And our commitment, quite simply, is to deliver continued strong results in 2016 and expand our business model to take advantage of the huge opportunities in the changing world. 
So with that, why don't we just open the phone lines for your questions."

If you look at, and I'm on Slide 23 here, if you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital. And what we benefited from was the fact that in 2014, we have the launch of the F-150 and delivered a launch effect at the end of the year as well. So we have a drain down, if you will, that was unusual of working capital. We kind of restored that or replenished that in 2015 and benefited from that. That does not, obviously, repeat in 2016. So that's one of the factors. The other factor on this slide, you can see favorable other and timing differences at least based on what we're seeing right now, for '16, we don't think we're going to benefit to the same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well. So those are the 2 factors that are causing us at this time, to say that it will still be strong, yet not as strong as what you're seeing here on Slide 23.

The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically have already locked in about 1/3 of our commodity's exposure, either through contracts largely on steel and/or on hedging that we do on some of the base metals, including aluminum, which is the second-largest exposure that we have. The other thing is our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we've identified across the full year largely hedged. On peak currencies, not every currency, because we believe some unhedged because we believe they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities. But we've locked in some of those commodities, 100% of operating basis at the beginning of the year and that's the position we're in right now. So we do that not tried to play the market but we are trying to reduce the volatility both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange, operating exchange."

And by us, that's normal as we get ready for the Chinese New Year. We're going in, we're in line with our stocks going in to January into China. And as I mentioned, China started off -- -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half versus the first half. But as I mentioned, really have to wait and see how January and February play out because where the Chinese New Year falls this year and we're going to get a good sense of that. Our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America in terms of the industry, we don't see the cycle being over. We, obviously, the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy costs, those type of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers. And when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, the oldest they've ever been, pickup trucks also are in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well. As we get into January, what we're seeing, it probably will be a solid month for the industry. But as you know, January is always a bit of a difficult month to call because it is a small industry, there's lots of seasonality. Of course, I think January turns into a weather report but, there's always storms and obviously we have the big one on the East Coast. So we can see and initially may be around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there. But I think it's a little bit of a tricky month.

We're going to have -- we expect, actually, our buying on F-150, we think there's upsIDE opportunity to grow it versus 2015 because we now have the availability of regular tabs and SuperCabs and we didn't have a lot of availability of that so that will give us some good entry points both from the mid and entry-level price points. So we think we have opportunity to grow at least our volume in F-150. But over the little longer term, we'll make our assumptions around what we think the segmentation is going and make appropriate capacity changes.

And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we del",799,"Okay. Thanks, Ted. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion.
Looking at the business units. Every business unit, with the exception of South America, was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability, and we earned over $0.25 billion, and that reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific had its best-ever annual profit. And of course, North America and Ford Credit continued to deliver strong profitability for the company.
We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years. And our Automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8%, and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in Automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion, and that was the best that we've generated since 2001. We also, at the same time, grew our global market share, and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products.
And a little bit of sampling of that. Explorer remains the best-selling 3-row SUV in the world. Mustang, which, as you know, we took global last year, is the world's best-selling sports car. F-Series is America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 years in a row. We're also again America's best-selling vehicle brand for the sixth straight year. And in Europe, we became the #1 commercial vehicle brand, and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years. And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight year of U.S. sales growth. And we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation.
And of course, along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 billion during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders.
Now looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago. Our net income came in at $1.9 billion. And our Automotive operating margin came in at 6.1%, and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong top line growth, with our wholesale volume and Automotive revenue both up 12%. And revenue was up 18% at constant exchange, and we generated strong Automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter. We were profitable in all business units except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations. And in Europe, we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter.
So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved, delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders. And we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year.
Now turning to Slide 4. 2015 was also a year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned. We improved quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products, and we continued to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all of our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near term while expanding our business model for the future. And we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company. And what this means is we're strengthening and investing in our core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles, but also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle test fleet in the industry. And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of Ford Pass. And as we do all of these, we're going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our ONE Ford plan, delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of the business.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the financial results"

And the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth column. Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full year. And what you'll see is everything is positive; so whether it's the growth factor, the operating results, the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015, whether it's the quarter or the full year.
Now I certainly wish to recognize that -- and we'll talk about it later in the presentation, that we're seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business, in fact all parts of the business in terms of the full year. And we should recognize, too, that we're benefiting from the big bet that we made on the F-150. We have the launch effects of that in 2014 and -- including in the fourth quarter. That was a big bet for the company, and it's paying off for us. It's certainly resonating with the customers. It's good for the environment. And certainly, as I said, we're reaping the rewards of that.
Since I'm going to touch on most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides, I just want to highlight 3 things that I won't come back to later. The first, down the page, under operating results, let's look at our earnings per share on an operating basis. You can see that we came in at $0.58, which is up 93% from a year ago; and $1.93, which is up 44%. Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income. You can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year, up $6.1 billion. If you go up just a couple of lines from there, you can see the special items, pretax charges. In the quarter, we had $714 million. That was almost completely explained by the remeasurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans.
Let's go on to Slide 6. I've got 3 slides for the full year. I'd like to touch on those first, and then we'll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter, and you can see the record of $10.8 billion. And then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything that's profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America. And if you look at the operations outside of North America, collectively, we made $223 million.
To me, the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis. If you look below the chart, you can see the changes, the $3.57 billion (sic) [ $3.507 billion ] improvement at the company level. It was driven by North America, $1.9 billion; Financial Services, a contributor over $200 million. But we've got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside of North America. And going forward, our whole strategy is to keep North America a strong candidate [ph] to the extent that we can, but it's really the other operations. We need to get them moving forward in a positive direction both in terms of profitability and returns. That's the big opportunity for us as well as the new opportunities. And you can see we made great progress on that in the full year, and I'll touch on that in the quarter as well.
Let's turn now to Slide 7. And here, we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the Automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page, wholesales, up 5%; revenue, up 4%; 9% at constant exchange; very strong improvement of the operating margin, 6.8%; and the pretax results of 60%. And on the lower left, you can see the global market share, which was up 0.2%. That was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix effects as well.
Let's go on to Slide 8. And here, we'll look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement in market factors, volume, mix, net pricing all driving that into positive direction. We did have cost increases, both contribution cost and structural cost. The one thing I'd like to highlight here, we have broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately. And you can see with the manufacturing callout that we've also indicated that it includes volume-related effects. Some companies include variable and labor and overhead in volume. So we don't do that. We put all of that in structural cost, which is why we don't call it fixed cost because we recognize that in a downturn, we're able to respond appropriately, whether it's taking overtime out, shifts, line speed changes and so forth. And -- so hopefully, that will help you understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business.
On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all that sits in North America, we've got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement. Most of that is a onetime ratification bonus. The rest of it is just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth, and that's sitting in our structural cost.
All right. Now let's move into the fourth quarter. I'll start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9; again, very strong performance, $2.6 billion. And again, glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and, again, the collected results of the operations outside North America, a profit of nearly $300 million.
Again, I want to highlight the story year-over-year. Go below the chart, first line, $1.3 billion; $400 million from North America; about $130 million from Financial Services; but more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again demonstrating the progress that we're making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world.
Now let's move to the key metrics on Slide 10; again, growth in wholesales, double digits; same thing in revenue, up 18% at constant exchange; a good margin for the fourth quarter, 6.1%; and pretax results that more than doubled. And on the lower left, you can see our global market share was flat.
Let's go on to Slide 11. And here, we'll look at the change in our Automotive sector results year-over-year, up $1.1 billion, very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We have cost increases. Again, look at the structural cost. You can see the manufacturing of $235 million. Almost all of that is volume-related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and then the ratification bonus to the far right.
Okay. Let's go on to North America. And here, we'll start going through the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter. It was their best quarter of growth of the year. You can see wholesales, up 15%; revenue, up nearly 20%; the operating margin, very, very good at 8.2%. Traditionally, fourth quarter is our weakest quarter. And this includes the full $600 million of UAW-related cost; so a really strong result from North America. And you can see the profit of $2.1 billion -- or $2 billion, up 26%. If you go below the chart, you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the board. And again, the margin came in at 10.2%.
As we look at the guidance for the year, we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins, about around where we actually ended up, about 9.5% or higher. But I thought I'd comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance. Let me just, again, put into context how we're seeing the North American business.
It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins. And as we've mentioned, in 3 of the last 4 years, other than the year when we launched the F-150, it's been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%. Now in 2016, we expect the margins again to be sort of in this range, 9.5% or higher, but unlike in 2015. When the year-over-year growth and the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth. And this is reflecting mainly 3 factors. The first is the fact that we'll see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we expect the impact of the Super Duty launch, which takes place in the second half, to have an impact. Now we've targeted a normal launch, but it's still going to incur costs associated with such a large launch, and we're going to have the normal volume ramp-up curve that we have to climb. So we'll have an effect in -- primarily in the third quarter. And as mentioned, lastly, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transform Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that's how we see it. We're very pleased with the results. We think we're going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016.
Okay. Let's go to the following slide, on Slide 13, and let's look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million, strong market factors; our cost increasing related to the products, which also drove the market factors; but also the structural costs, which were largely volume-related and the UAW agreement; with the ratification bonus also having an effect, which is over in other."

And that was more than double the industry increase. And going forward, this year, we're going to continue to focus on profitable growth while, at the same time, launching some very important, high-volume products like the Escape, the Fusion, and, as Bob mentioned, the Super Duty."

And certainly, the strong dollar commodity -- weak commodity cycle is one. And there's probably no region that's more affected by this than South America. And you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. You could see that wholesales were down sharply, 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%. About 45% of that was related to weaker currencies; margin, of course, down sharply; and the results were down as well. If you look at the fourth quarter, the same story. But when you get to the full year, you can see that the -- we actually had an improvement in the results, and that was related to the fact that we have the non-repeat of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014.
In terms of guidance, as we mentioned, we expect our guidance -- or our guidance for that region is that it will be a loss in 2016 and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015.
Okay. Let's move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million. And if you look up, the callout box on volume and mix, you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline. We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter. It clearly had an impact on the business. But I'll tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We had strong pricing. We had very favorable results in terms of cost performance. And I would highlight that within this positive cost factors, we have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and Argentina. And then lastly, I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso that came towards the end of the year as the new government started taking action to restructure the economy. So it's good for the longer term of Argentina but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter.
Okay. Let's turn to Europe now, which is our very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, we [indiscernible] that's the third consecutive quarter of profitability. We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% in wholesales, up 19% if you are on exchange constant; and of course, return to profitability with a positive margin.
And the story on the full year basis is just as good. We had growth, although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange. It was actually up 8%; and of course, the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million.
Now if you look on the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up 0.6 point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also had favorable market share among the Europe 20, and that was driven by good performance of the Mondeo and the EcoSport.
In terms of guidance for 2016, we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. And here, we'll look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe; so up $428 million; and going across the page, most everything positive. We had favorable volume and mix. We had higher net pricing. We had lower cost. And if you go to the far right, the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford Sollers entity in Russia; so a really, really strong performance right across the board in Europe."

You can see we had growth in the quarter. We also had positive results. And for the year -- or full year, we had a profit of $31 million as the team continues to start to unfold the growth strategy that they developed and put in place last year. As we move into 2016, we expect the results to be about the same, if not better, in Middle East and Africa.
All right. Let's go on to Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific; a great story here. Wholesales were up sharply, 16%. The revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange; a very strong operating margin; and a record pretax results in the quarter. If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year, similar story, not quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearly the big quarter of the growth in 2015; very strong margin of over 7%; and that record profit that we talked about earlier.
On the lower left, you can see the share in China was flat, but we did improve the share overall across the region, and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix.
In terms of guidance, we're expecting results in 2016 to be even better than they were in 2015.
Let's go to Slide 20, and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific, which was quite strong, $349 million. It was largely driven by volume and mix. And you can see it was industry, a bit of share, which is again geographic mix, favorable stocks as the industry grew. And we also got new products into the pipeline. And then mix was very, very strong. Within this mix and other of $181 million, you actually had $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge, which is hot and high margin; as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga. And then you can see that the costs were pretty much flat. And over at the far right, you can see other. That is largely the royalties in China, so volume-related as well; so a very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016."

They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015, although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half. But just a note to point out that, as you know, the Chinese New Year is very variable. Some years, it falls in January. Some years, it falls in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clear view of how the industry is tracking."

We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations. On the far left, you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported Ford's growth overall. Pretax results of $556 million, that was up 31%.
And then we've got 3 metrics, which just represent the portfolio performance, which continues to be very strong and very robust. And for those of you who want to understand more, of course, you can call into the fixed income call, which will take place later today. And our team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance. But the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and, in fact compared to history, low levels.
If you look at the data below the chart, again, growth across the board there, whether it's volume or managed receivables of the profit, it's $2.1 billion. And again, look at those portfolio performance metrics, all looking quite good. And this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase policies. It's been implementing those very consistently for a number of years. So for example, in terms of -- high-risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of the portfolio, and it's performing very well as the data indicates.
What I want to highlight on the left -- and I'm not going to talk about it until I get to the next slide. But look at the debt, $120 billion to support Ford Credit, and the managed leverage of 9.5 to 1. We target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of the United States.
In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be a strong performer, about the same, if not better, in 2016 than it was in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 22, and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance of Ford Credit. You can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the group in terms of the products and services that it provides, and favorable financing margin which came from lower borrowing costs.
With that, let's go on to Slide 23, and we'll look at Automotive sector cash and cash flow. These is a really great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about 1/3 of the way down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of Automotive operating-related cash flow in the quarter, driven by the profits; and if you look at the full year, the $7.3 billion record at least since 2001, again driven by the very strong profits. And then you can see the uses of the cash below that.
On the lower left, you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level; and then the Automotive debt of $12.8 billion. I just want to stop right here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we've seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company. And generally, that point of view is because people are taking this Automotive debt. They're adding it to the Financial Services debt, which was on a previous page. And of course, the business would look pretty higher leveraged. But that's not the way that investors should look at it. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self-funding. Ford Credit also self-liquidates in a downturn and lower volume. And so you think about Ford Credit separately. And then in terms of its own leverage, you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on. And as I mentioned, we've historically been within the 8% to 9% we target, a little bit above because of the translation effect in '15, but we're going to go back into range in 2016.
The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is this: what's on this page, the $12.8 billion. And this is the lowest it's been since 2000. And it's representative of a very good leverage position by the company, along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. So we're in a great shape in terms of the balance sheet, but I just want to clarify that for everyone if you had any questions about that.
Okay. I'm going to wrap up on Slide 24, and this is looking at the planning assumptions and key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year. And all I'll say is we delivered.
If you go to the very bottom of the slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax 5-year average return on invested capital. We came in at 16% in 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 and, in both years, well above the cost of capital.
So Mark, back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up."

Now as always, for our process, we're going to continue to monitor the business environment to anticipate or react to any changes that we see and take appropriate action.
So to sum it up, before we get to the Q&A, we promised and we delivered on our commitments for 2015. We promised to restructure and invest in our operations around the world, and we delivered in both top line and bottom line growth. And this year, our commitment is to accelerate our pace of progress even further by building on our strengths, but also, we're growing lean. We're going to be focusing, obviously, on profitability and making tough choices to restructure where necessary. We're moving fast to expand our business model, and we're on track to deliver both our near- and our long-term strategic objectives.

If you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital. And what we benefited from was the fact that in 2014, we had the launch of the F-150 and there was a launch effect at the end of the year as well. So we had a drain down, if you will, that was unusual of our working capital. We kind of restored that, replenished that in 2015 and benefited from that. That does not, obviously, repeat in 2016. So that's one of the factors. The other factor, on this slide, you can see favorable other and timing differences. And at least based on what we're seeing right now, for '16, we don't think we're going to benefit to the same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well. So those are the 2 factors that are causing us, at this time, to say that it will still be strong yet not as strong as what you're seeing here on Slide 23. So I think you get a sense that it's going to be a good number but just not at the level that we're seeing right now.

When we developed the 8% to 10%, that's -- this was before. This was quite a number of years ago actually. So since then, we've had this big reduction in interest rates, which really drove very big increases in these remeasurement losses, which is one of the reasons why after we saw this occur and understood how the market -- but it's really quite sophisticated in understanding the company's results when they treated it in the way that we're now treating it. And so we decided to move in that direction so that you could clearly see the operating performance of the business. So we developed 8% to 10% before that. So I would say we're back to where we were in terms of the effect of that on the business. And we developed the 8% to 10%, thinking of it as over a longer business cycle. It's not peak. We'd actually like to -- maybe we'll be a bit below that in a downturn. But we'd like, on average, to sort of be around that 8% to 10%. And so we see that as something that we're aspiring to get to [indiscernible] breakeven that we have with North America. That's probably where we would be. But going forward, as we've said, we're operating at this 10% level, in fact, in 2 of the last 4 years. I think we're over 11% if I'm not mistaken. So we clearly can go higher, and we're continuing to work to do that. And certainly, Joe is working to stay at the level that we've been the last several years and do even better if possible.

In 2016, you won't see such a big effect. So I see much less of an increase in contribution cost in North America than we saw in 2015.

It will be in engineering and some of the other aspects of the business, including, frankly, some of the initiatives that we're working on in Smart Mobility.

So I think the net of the 2, at the moment, they're going to change it every day, as you highlighted. But the net of the 2 won't be quite as strong as it was in '15. The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically have already locked in about 1/3 of our commodities exposure either through contracts largely on steel and/or hedging that we do on some of the base metals, including aluminum, which is the second-largest exposure that we have. The other thing is that our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we've identified across the full year largely hedged on key currencies, not every currency, because we released some unhedged because we believe that they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities. But we've locked in some of those commodities, 100%, on an operating basis at the beginning of the year, and that's the position that we're in right now. So we do that not to play the market, but we're trying to reduce the volatility both -- and both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange, operating exchange."

In China, obviously, we -- as we mentioned, when you look at the stock market volatility, I mean, that's endemic of a country that's moving from an investment and industry-led economy to one that's consumer-led. And actually, when you look at the components of GDP growth there, the services and the consumer portions of that are actually growing while some of the industry ones are coming down. And we view that as a good sign. It's going to be a bit bumpy as they go through that transition. As we mentioned, in the fourth quarter, you usually see a -- more production by the industry. And by us, that's normal as we get for the -- get ready for the Chinese New Year. We're going in. We're in line with our stocks going into January into China. And as I mentioned, China started off -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half versus the first half. But as I mentioned, we really have to wait and see how January and February play out because of where the Chinese New Year falls this year, and we'll get a good sense for that. But our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America, in terms of the industry, we don't see the cycle being over. We -- obviously, the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy cost, those type of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers. And when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, the oldest they've ever been, pickup trucks also in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well. As we get into January, what we're seeing, it will probably be a solid month for the industry. But as you know, January is always a bit of a difficult month to call, right, because it's a small industry. There's lots of seasonality. Of course, I hate to turn the January always into a weather report, but there's always storms. And obviously, we have that big one on the East Coast. So we could see an industry maybe around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there. But I think it's a little bit of a tricky month. But what we're seeing in our business, commercial sales continue to be strong, and we'll report out on February 2."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we del",799,"Okay. Thanks, Ted. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion.
Looking at the business units. Every business unit, with the exception of South America, was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability, and we earned over $0.25 billion, and that reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific had its best-ever annual profit. And of course, North America and Ford Credit continued to deliver strong profitability for the company.
We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years. And our Automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8%, and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in Automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion, and that was the best that we've generated since 2001. We also, at the same time, grew our global market share, and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products.
And a little bit of sampling of that. Explorer remains the best-selling 3-row SUV in the world. Mustang, which, as you know, we took global last year, is the world's best-selling sports car. F-Series is America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 years in a row. We're also again America's best-selling vehicle brand for the sixth straight year. And in Europe, we became the #1 commercial vehicle brand, and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years. And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight year of U.S. sales growth. And we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation.
And of course, along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 billion during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders.
Now looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago. Our net income came in at $1.9 billion. And our Automotive operating margin came in at 6.1%, and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong top line growth, with our wholesale volume and Automotive revenue both up 12%. And revenue was up 18% at constant exchange, and we generated strong Automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter. We were profitable in all business units except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations. And in Europe, we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter.
So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved, delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders. And we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year.
Now turning to Slide 4. 2015 was also a year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned. We improved quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products, and we continued to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all of our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near term while expanding our business model for the future. 
And we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company. And what this means is we're strengthening and investing in our core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles, but also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle test fleet in the industry. And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of Ford Pass. And as we do all of this, we're going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our ONE Ford plan, delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of the business.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the financial results"

Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full",1747,"Thanks, Mark. What I'd like to do is to start on Slide 5, which is our key financial summary. And the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth column. Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full year. And what you'll see is everything is positive; so whether it's the growth factors, the operating results, the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015, whether it's the quarter or the full year.
Now certainly, we should recognize that, and we'll talk about it later in the presentation, that we're seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business, in fact all parts of the business in terms of the full year. And we should recognize, too, that we're benefiting from the big bet that we made on the F-150. We have the launch effects of that in 2014 and -- including in the fourth quarter. That was a big bet for the company, and it's paying off for us. It's certainly resonating with the customers. It's good for the environment. And certainly, as I said, we're reaping the rewards of that.
Since I'm going to touch on most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides, I just want to highlight 3 things that I won't come back to later. The first, down the page, under operating results, let's look at our earnings per share on an operating basis. You can see that we came in at $0.58, which is up 93% from a year ago; and $1.93, which is up 44%. Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income. You can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year, up $6.1 billion. If you go up just a couple of lines from there, you can see the special items, pretax charges. In the quarter, we had $714 million. That was almost completely explained by the remeasurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans.
Let's go on to Slide 6. I've got 3 slides for the full year. I'd like to touch on those first, and then we'll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter, and you can see the record of $10.8 billion. And then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything was profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America. And if you look at the operations outside of North America, collectively, we made $223 million.
To me, the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis. If you look below the chart, you can see the changes, the $3.57 billion (sic) [ $3.507 billion ] improvement at the company level. It was driven by North America, $1.9 billion; Financial Services, a contributor over $200 million. But we've got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside of North America. And going forward, our whole strategy is to keep North America a strong, strengthen it to the extent that we can, but it's really the other operations. We need to get them moving forward in a positive direction both in terms of profitability and returns. That's the big opportunity for us as well as the new opportunities. And you can see we made great progress on that in the full year, and I'll touch on that in the quarter as well.
Let's turn now to Slide 7. And here, we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the Automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page, wholesales, up 5%; revenue, up 4%; 9% at constant exchange; very strong improvement of the operating margin, 6.8%; and the pretax results up 60%. And on the lower left, you can see the global market share, which was up 0.2%. That was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix effects as well.
Let's go on to Slide 8. And here, we'll look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement in market factors, volume, mix, net pricing all driving that in a positive direction. We did have cost increases, both contribution cost and structural cost. The one thing I'd like to highlight here, we have broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately. And you can see with the manufacturing callout that we've also indicated that it includes volume-related effects. Some companies include variable and labor and overhead in volume. But we don't do that. We put all of that in structural cost, which is why we don't call it fixed cost because we recognize that in a downturn, we're able to respond appropriately, whether it's taking overtime out, shifts, line speed changes and so forth. And -- so hopefully, that will help you understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business.
On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all that sits in North America, we've got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement. Most of that is a onetime ratification bonus. The rest of it is just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth, and that's sitting in our structural cost.
All right. Now let's move into the fourth quarter. I'll start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9; again, very strong performance, $2.6 billion. And again, glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and, again, the collected results of the operations outside North America, a profit of nearly $300 million.
Again, I want to highlight the story year-over-year. Go below the chart, first line, $1.3 billion; $400 million from North America; about $130 million from Financial Services; but more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again demonstrating the progress that we're making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world.
Now let's move to the key metrics on Slide 10; again, growth in wholesale is double digits; same thing in revenue, up 18% at constant exchange; a good margin for the fourth quarter, 6.1%; and pretax results have more than doubled. And on the lower left, you can see our global market share was flat.
Let's go on to Slide 11. And here, we'll look at the change in our Automotive sector results year-over-year, up $1.1 billion, very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We have cost increases. Again, look at the structural cost. You can see the manufacturing of $235 million. Almost all of that is volume-related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and then the ratification bonus to the far right.
Okay. Let's go on to North America. And here, we'll start going through the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter. It was their best quarter of growth of the year. You can see wholesale's up 15%; revenue, up nearly 20%; the operating margin, very, very good at 8.2%. Traditionally, fourth quarter is our weakest quarter. And this includes the full $600 million of UAW-related cost; so a really strong result from North America. And you can see the profit of $2.1 billion -- or $2 billion, up 26%. If you go below the chart, you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the board. And again, the margin came in at 10.2%.
As we look at the guidance for the year, we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins, about around where we actually ended up, about 9.5% or higher. But I thought I'd comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance. Let me just, again, put into context how we're seeing the North American business.
It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins. And as we've mentioned, in 3 of the last 4 years, other than the year when we launched the F-150, it's been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%. Now in 2016, we expect the margins again to be sort of in this range, 9.5% or higher. But unlike in 2015, when the year-over-year growth and the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth. 
And this is reflecting mainly 3 factors. The first is the fact that we'll see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we expect the impact of the Super Duty launch, which takes place in the second half, to have an impact. Now we've called it a normal launch, but it's still going to incur costs associated with such a large launch, and we're going to have the normal volume ramp-up curve that we have to climb. So we'll have an effect in -- primarily in the third quarter. And as mentioned, lastly, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transform Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that's how we see it. We're very pleased with the results. We think we're going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016.
Okay. Let's go to the following slide, on Slide 13, and let's look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million, strong market factors; our cost increasing related to the products, which also drove the market factors; but also the structural costs, which were largely volume-related and the UAW agreement; with the ratification bonus also having an effect, which is over in other."

And going forward, this year, we're going to continue to focus on profitable growth while, at the same time, launching some very important, high-volume products like the Escape, the Fusion, and, as Bob mentioned, the Super Duty."

And certainly, the strong dollar commodity -- weak commodity cycle is one. And there's probably no region that's more affected by this than South America. And you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. You could see that wholesales were down sharply, 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%, about 45% of that was related to weaker currencies; margin, of course, down sharply; and the results were down as well. 
If you look at the fourth quarter, the same story. But when you get to the full year, you can see that the -- we actually had an improvement in the results, and that was related to the fact that we have the non-repeat of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014.
In terms of guidance, as we mentioned, we expect our guidance -- or our guidance for that region is that it will be a loss in 2016 and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015.
Okay. Let's move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million. And if you look at e callout box on volume and mix, you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline. We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter. It clearly had an impact on the business. But I'll tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We had strong pricing. We had very favorable results in terms of cost performance. And I would highlight that within these positive cost factors, we have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and Argentina. 
And then lastly, I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso that came towards the end of the year as the new government started to take action to restructure the economy. So it's good for the longer term of Argentina but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter.
Okay. Let's turn to Europe now, which is a very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, we were profitable. That's the third consecutive quarter of profitability. We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% in wholesales, up 19% if you are on exchange constant; and of course, return to profitability with a positive margin.
And the story on the full year basis is just as good. We had growth, although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange. It was actually up 8%; and of course, the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million.
Now if you look on the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up 0.6 point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also had favorable market share among the Europe 20, and that was driven by good performance of the Mondeo and the EcoSport.
In terms of guidance for 2016, we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. And here, we'll look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe; so up $428 million; and going across the page, most everything positive. We had favorable volume and mix. We had higher net pricing. We had lower cost. And if you go to the far right, the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford Sollers entity in Russia; so a really, really strong performance right across the board in Europe."

As we move into 2016, we expect the results to be about the same, if not better, in Middle East and Africa.
All right. Let's go on to Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific; a great story here. Wholesales were up sharply, 16%. The revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange; a very strong operating margin; and a record pretax results in the quarter. If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year, similar story, not quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearly the big quarter of the growth in 2015; very strong margin of over 7%; and that record profit that we talked about earlier.
On the lower left, you can see the share in China was flat, but we did improve the share overall across the region, and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix.
In terms of guidance, we're expecting results in 2016 to be even better than they were in 2015.
Let's go to Slide 20, and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific, which was quite strong, $349 million. It was largely driven by volume and mix. And you can see it was industry, a bit of share, which is again geographic mix, favorable stocks as the industry grew. And we also got new products into the pipeline. And then mix was very, very strong. Within this mix and other of $181 million, you actually had $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge, which is hot and high margin; as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga. And then you can see that the costs were pretty much flat. And over at the far right, you can see other. That is largely the royalties in China, so volume-related as well; so a very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016."

They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015, although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half. But just a note to point out that, as you know, the Chinese New Year is very variable. Some years, it falls in January. Some years, it falls in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clearer view of how the industry is tracking."

We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations. So on the far left, you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported Ford's growth overall. Pretax results of $556 million, that was up 31%.
And then we've got 3 metrics, which just represent the portfolio performance, which continues to be very strong and very robust. And for those of you who want to understand more, of course, you can call into the fixed income call, which will take place later today. And the IR team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance. But the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and, in fact compared to history, low levels.
If you look at the data below the chart, again, growth across the board there, whether it's volume or managed receivables of the profit of $2.1 billion. And again, look at those portfolio performance metrics, all looking quite good. And this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase policies. It's been implementing those very consistently for a number of years. So for example, in terms of -- high-risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of the portfolio, and it's performing very well as the data indicates.
What I want to highlight on the left -- and I'm not going to talk about it until I get to the next slide. But look at the debt, $120 billion to support Ford Credit, and the managed leverage of 9.5:1. We target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of the United States.
In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be a strong performer, about the same, if not better, in 2016 than it was in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 22, and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance of Ford Credit. You can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the group in terms of the products and services that it provides, and favorable financing margin which came from lower borrowing costs.
With that, let's go on to Slide 23, and we'll look at Automotive sector cash and cash flow. This is a really great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about 1/3 of the way down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of Automotive operating-related cash flow in the quarter, driven by the profits; and if you look at the full year, the $7.3 billion record at least since 2001, again driven by the very strong profits. And then you can see the uses of the cash below that.
On the lower left, you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level; and then the Automotive debt of $12.8 billion. I just want to stop right here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we've seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company. And generally, that point of view is because people are taking this Automotive debt. They're adding it to the Financial Services debt, which was on a previous page. And of course, the business would look pretty highly leveraged. But that's not the way that investors should look at it. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. 
If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self-funding. Ford Credit also self-liquidates in a downturn and lower volume. And so you think about Ford Credit separately. And then in terms of its own leverage, you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on. And as I mentioned, we've historically been within the 8% to 9% we target, a little bit above because of the translation effect in '15, but we're going to go back into range in 2016.
The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is this: what's on this page, the $12.8 billion. And this is the lowest it's been since 2000. And it's representative of a very good leverage position by the company, along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. So we're in a great shape in terms of the balance sheet, but I just want to clarify that for everyone if you had any questions about that.
Okay. I'm going to wrap up on Slide 24, and this is looking at the planning assumptions and key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year. And all I'll say is we delivered.
If you go to the very bottom of the slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax 5-year average return on invested capital. We came in at 16% in 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 and, in both years, well above the cost of capital.
So Mark, back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up."

And this year, our commitment is to accelerate our pace of progress even further by building on our strengths, but also, we're growing lean. We're going to be focusing, obviously, on profitability and making tough choices to restructure where necessary. We're moving fast to expand our business model, and we're on track to deliver both our near- and our long-term strategic objectives. And our commitment, quite simply, is to deliver continued strong results in 2016 and expand our business model to take advantage of the huge opportunities in a changing world.
So with that, why don't we just open the phone lines for your questions."

Bob, as we look at the pretax profit that you're looking at for the total company, it's going to be flat on a year-over-year basis. So I would imagine that's -- or up. But that's not going to have too big an impact. It would be negative on free cash flow in 2016. So why sort of the same or lower for the free cash flow number for 2016? Is there something else going on below the line that either benefited on in '15 or would be a headwind in '16?"

There are 2 things to think about in terms of our call for 2016, and one of them is exactly what you mentioned. If you look -- and I'm on Slide 23 here. If you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital. And what we benefited from was the fact that in 2014, we had the launch of the F-150 and there was a launch effect at the end of the year as well. So we had a drain down, if you will, that was unusual of our working capital. We kind of restored that, replenished that in 2015 and benefited from that. That does not, obviously, repeat in 2016. So that's one of the factors. The other factor, on this slide, you can see favorable other and timing differences. And at least based on what we're seeing right now, for '16, we don't think we're going to benefit to the same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well. So those are the 2 factors that are causing us, at this time, to say that it will still be strong yet not as strong as what you're seeing here on Slide 23. So I think you get a sense that it's going to be a good number but just not at the level that we're seeing right now. Now of course, we're going to continue to work to try to get everything up that we can, and we'll update you in the year if things change."

And so we decided to move in that direction so that you could clearly see the operating performance of the business. So we developed 8% to 10% before that. So I would say we're back to where we were in terms of the effect of that on the business. And we developed the 8% to 10%, thinking of it as over a longer business cycle. It's not peak. We'd actually like to -- maybe we'll be a bit below that in a downturn. But we'd like, on average, to sort of be around that 8% to 10%. And so we see that as something that we're aspiring to get to. We think with the breakeven that we have with North America that that's probably where we would be. But going forward, as we've said, we're operating at this 10% level. In fact, in 2 of the last 4 years, I think, we were over 11% if I'm not mistaken. So we clearly can go higher, and we're continuing to work to do that.

The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically have already locked in about 1/3 of our commodities exposure either through contracts largely on steel and/or hedging that we do on some of the base metals, including aluminum, which is the second-largest exposure that we have. The other thing is that our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we've identified across the full year largely hedged on key currencies, not every currency, because we leave some unhedged because we believe that they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities. But we lock in some of those commodities, 100%, on an operating basis at the beginning of the year, and that's the position that we're in right now. So we do that not to play the market, but we're trying to reduce the volatility both -- and both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange, operating exchange."

Apparently, your pickup truck sales and light truck sales overall are very strong. But within your results, can you give us a sense of what the drag is on cars? Maybe recap some of the capacity actions taken. And then with regard to the light trucks, since these low gas prices haven't been lost on others, we heard from a competitor in your suburbs yesterday about adding SUV and pickup truck capacity. Some of the Asians seem to be converting car to CV capacity. And how do you see the capacity situation in the industry for light trucks versus cars going forward?"

We have opportunities to -- we're -- in terms of capacity, we're nearly there, but we have opportunities to add line speeds, work during some of the shutdown periods, et cetera. So I think we're well positioned there. And in terms of the car capacity, as you know, we did take some downtime in, for example, our Michigan Assembly Plant to make sure our stock is in line for vehicles like our Focus. But overall, we'll just continue to work our process. And you know our process. It's always matching production to demand, and we'll adjust as necessary. And just 2 more things on the truck piece of it. I'll be getting a little bit more specific.

And actually, when you look at the components of GDP growth there, the services and the consumer portions of that are actually growing while some of the industry ones are coming down. And we view that as a good sign. It's going to be a bit bumpy as they go through that transition. As we mentioned, in the fourth quarter, you usually see a -- more production by the industry. And by us, that's normal as we get for the -- get ready for the Chinese New Year. We're -- going in, we're in line with our stocks going into January into China. And as I mentioned, China started off -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half versus the first half. But as I mentioned, we really have to wait and see how January and February play out because of where the Chinese New Year falls this year, and we'll get a good sense for that. But our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America, in terms of the industry, we don't see the cycle being over. We -- obviously, the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy cost, those type of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers. And when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, they're the oldest they've ever been, pickup trucks also in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well. As we get into January, what we're seeing, it will probably be a solid month for the industry. But as you know, January is always a bit of a difficult month to call, right, because it's a small industry. There's lots of seasonality. Of course, I hate to turn January always into a weather report, but there's always storms. And obviously, we have that big one on the East Coast. So we could see an industry maybe around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there. But I think it's a little bit of a tricky month.

And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we del",799,"Okay. Thanks, Ted. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall last year on this call, we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion.
Looking at the business units. Every business unit, with the exception of South America, was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability, and we earned over $0.25 billion, and that reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific had its best-ever annual profit. And of course, North America and Ford Credit continued to deliver strong profitability for the company.
We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years. And our Automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8%, and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in Automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion, and that was the best that we've generated since 2001. We also, at the same time, grew our global market share, and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products.
And a little bit of sampling of that. Explorer remains the best-selling 3-row SUV in the world. Mustang, which, as you know, we took global last year, is the world's best-selling sports car. F-Series is America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 years in a row. We're also again America's best-selling vehicle brand for the sixth straight year. And in Europe, we became the #1 commercial vehicle brand, and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years. And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight year of U.S. sales growth. And we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation.
And of course, along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 billion during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders.
Now looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago. Our net income came in at $1.9 billion. And our Automotive operating margin came in at 6.1%, and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong top line growth, with our wholesale volume and Automotive revenue both up 12%. And revenue was up 18% at constant exchange, and we generated strong Automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter. We were profitable in all business units except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations. And in Europe, we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter.
So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved, delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders. And we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year.
Now turning to Slide 4. 2015 was also a year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned. We improved quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products, and we continued to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all of our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near term while expanding our business model for the future. 
And we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company. And what this means is we're strengthening and investing in our core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles, but also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle test fleet in the industry. And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of Ford Pass. And as we do all of this, we're going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our ONE Ford plan, delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of the business.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the financial results"

And the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth column. Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full year. And what you'll see is everything is positive; so whether it's the growth factors, the operating results, the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015, whether it's the quarter or the full year.
Now certainly, we should recognize that, and we'll talk about it later in the presentation, that we're seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business, in fact all parts of the business in terms of the full year. And we should recognize, too, that we're benefiting from the big bet that we made on the F-150. We have the launch effects of that in 2014 and -- including in the fourth quarter. That was a big bet for the company, and it's paying off for us. It's certainly resonating with the customers. It's good for the environment. And certainly, as I said, we're reaping the rewards of that.
Since I'm going to touch on most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides, I just want to highlight 3 things that I won't come back to later. The first, down the page, under operating results, let's look at our earnings per share on an operating basis. You can see that we came in at $0.58, which is up 93% from a year ago; and $1.93, which is up 44%. Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income. You can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year, up $6.1 billion. If you go up just a couple of lines from there, you can see the special items, pretax charges. In the quarter, we had $714 million. That was almost completely explained by the remeasurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans.
Let's go on to Slide 6. I've got 3 slides for the full year. I'd like to touch on those first, and then we'll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter, and you can see the record of $10.8 billion. And then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything was profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America. And if you look at the operations outside of North America, collectively, we made $223 million.
To me, the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis. If you look below the chart, you can see the changes, the $3.57 billion (sic) [ $3.507 billion ] improvement at the company level. It was driven by North America, $1.9 billion; Financial Services, a contributor over $200 million. But we've got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside of North America. And going forward, our whole strategy is to keep North America a strong, strengthen it to the extent that we can, but it's really the other operations. We need to get them moving forward in a positive direction both in terms of profitability and returns. That's the big opportunity for us as well as the new opportunities. And you can see we made great progress on that in the full year, and I'll touch on that in the quarter as well.
Let's turn now to Slide 7. And here, we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the Automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page, wholesales, up 5%; revenue, up 4%; 9% at constant exchange; very strong improvement of the operating margin, 6.8%; and the pretax results up 60%. And on the lower left, you can see the global market share, which was up 0.2%. That was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix effects as well.
Let's go on to Slide 8. And here, we'll look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement in market factors, volume, mix, net pricing all driving that in a positive direction. We did have cost increases, both contribution cost and structural cost. The one thing I'd like to highlight here, we have broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately. And you can see with the manufacturing callout that we've also indicated that it includes volume-related effects. Some companies include variable and labor and overhead in volume. But we don't do that. We put all of that in structural cost, which is why we don't call it fixed cost because we recognize that in a downturn, we're able to respond appropriately, whether it's taking overtime out, shifts, line speed changes and so forth. And -- so hopefully, that will help you understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business.
On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all that sits in North America, we've got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement. Most of that is a onetime ratification bonus. The rest of it is just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth, and that's sitting in our structural cost.
All right. Now let's move into the fourth quarter. I'll start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9; again, very strong performance, $2.6 billion. And again, glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and, again, the collected results of the operations outside North America, a profit of nearly $300 million.
Again, I want to highlight the story year-over-year. Go below the chart, first line, $1.3 billion; $400 million from North America; about $130 million from Financial Services; but more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again demonstrating the progress that we're making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world.
Now let's move to the key metrics on Slide 10; again, growth in wholesale is double digits; same thing in revenue, up 18% at constant exchange; a good margin for the fourth quarter, 6.1%; and pretax results have more than doubled. And on the lower left, you can see our global market share was flat.
Let's go on to Slide 11. And here, we'll look at the change in our Automotive sector results year-over-year, up $1.1 billion, very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We have cost increases. Again, look at the structural cost. You can see the manufacturing of $235 million. Almost all of that is volume-related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and then the ratification bonus to the far right.
Okay. Let's go on to North America. And here, we'll start going through the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter. It was their best quarter of growth of the year. You can see wholesale's up 15%; revenue, up nearly 20%; the operating margin, very, very good at 8.2%. Traditionally, fourth quarter is our weakest quarter. And this includes the full $600 million of UAW-related cost; so a really strong result from North America. And you can see the profit of $2.1 billion -- or $2 billion, up 26%. If you go below the chart, you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the board. And again, the margin came in at 10.2%.
As we look at the guidance for the year, we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins, about around where we actually ended up, about 9.5% or higher. But I thought I'd comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance. Let me just, again, put into context how we're seeing the North American business.
It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins. And as we've mentioned, in 3 of the last 4 years, other than the year when we launched the F-150, it's been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%. Now in 2016, we expect the margins again to be sort of in this range, 9.5% or higher. But unlike in 2015, when the year-over-year growth and the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth. 
And this is reflecting mainly 3 factors. The first is the fact that we'll see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we expect the impact of the Super Duty launch, which takes place in the second half, to have an impact. Now we've called it a normal launch, but it's still going to incur costs associated with such a large launch, and we're going to have the normal volume ramp-up curve that we have to climb. So we'll have an effect in -- primarily in the third quarter. And as mentioned, lastly, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transform Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that's how we see it. We're very pleased with the results. We think we're going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016.
Okay. Let's go to the following slide, on Slide 13, and let's look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million, strong market factors; our cost increasing related to the products, which also drove the market factors; but also the structural costs, which were largely volume-related and the UAW agreement; with the ratification bonus also having an effect, which is over in other."

And that was more than double the industry increase. 
And going forward, this year, we're going to continue to focus on profitable growth while, at the same time, launching some very important, high-volume products like the Escape, the Fusion, and, as Bob mentioned, the Super Duty."

And certainly, the strong dollar commodity -- weak commodity cycle is one. And there's probably no region that's more affected by this than South America. And you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. You could see that wholesales were down sharply, 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%, about 45% of that was related to weaker currencies; margin, of course, down sharply; and the results were down as well. 
If you look at the fourth quarter, the same story. But when you get to the full year, you can see that the -- we actually had an improvement in the results, and that was related to the fact that we have the non-repeat of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014.
In terms of guidance, as we mentioned, we expect our guidance -- or our guidance for that region is that it will be a loss in 2016 and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015.
Okay. Let's move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million. And if you look at the callout box on volume and mix, you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline. We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter. It clearly had an impact on the business. But I'll tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We had strong pricing. We had very favorable results in terms of cost performance. And I would highlight that within these positive cost factors, we have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and Argentina. 
And then lastly, I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso that came towards the end of the year as the new government started to take action to restructure the economy. So it's good for the longer term of Argentina but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter.
Okay. Let's turn to Europe now, which is a very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, we were profitable. That's the third consecutive quarter of profitability. We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% in wholesales, up 19% if you are on exchange constant; and of course, return to profitability with a positive margin.
And the story on the full year basis is just as good. We had growth, although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange. It was actually up 8%; and of course, the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million.
Now if you look on the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up 0.6 point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also had favorable market share among the Europe 20, and that was driven by good performance of the Mondeo and the EcoSport.
In terms of guidance for 2016, we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. And here, we'll look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe; so up $428 million; and going across the page, most everything positive. We had favorable volume and mix. We had higher net pricing. We had lower cost. And if you go to the far right, the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford Sollers entity in Russia; so a really, really strong performance right across the board in Europe."

As we move into 2016, we expect the results to be about the same, if not better, in Middle East and Africa.
All right. Let's go on to Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific; a great story here. Wholesales were up sharply, 16%. The revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange; a very strong operating margin; and a record pretax results in the quarter. If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year, similar story, not quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearly the big quarter of the growth in 2015; very strong margin of over 7%; and that record profit that we talked about earlier.
On the lower left, you can see the share in China was flat, but we did improve the share overall across the region, and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix.
In terms of guidance, we're expecting results in 2016 to be even better than they were in 2015.
Let's go to Slide 20, and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific, which was quite strong, $349 million. It was largely driven by volume and mix. And you can see it was industry, a bit of share, which is again geographic mix, favorable stocks as the industry grew. And we also got new products into the pipeline. And then mix was very, very strong. Within this mix and other of $181 million, you actually had $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge, which is hot and high margin; as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga. And then you can see that the costs were pretty much flat. And over at the far right, you can see other. That is largely the royalties in China, so volume-related as well; so a very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016."

They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015, although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half. But just a note to point out that, as you know, the Chinese New Year is very variable. Some years, it falls in January. Some years, it falls in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clearer view of how the industry is tracking."

We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations. So on the far left, you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported Ford's growth overall. Pretax results of $556 million, that was up 31%.
And then we've got 3 metrics, which just represent the portfolio performance, which continues to be very strong and very robust. And for those of you who want to understand more, of course, you can call into the fixed income call, which will take place later today. And the IR team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance. But the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and, in fact compared to history, low levels.
If you look at the data below the chart, again, growth across the board there, whether it's volume or managed receivables of the profit of $2.1 billion. And again, look at those portfolio performance metrics, all looking quite good. And this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase policies. It's been implementing those very consistently for a number of years. So for example, in terms of -- high-risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of the portfolio, and it's performing very well as the data indicates.
What I want to highlight on the left -- and I'm not going to talk about it until I get to the next slide. But look at the debt, $120 billion to support Ford Credit, and the managed leverage of 9.5:1. We target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of the United States.
In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be a strong performer, about the same, if not better, in 2016 than it was in 2015.
Now let's turn to Slide 22, and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance of Ford Credit. You can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the group in terms of the products and services that it provides, and favorable financing margin which came from lower borrowing costs.
With that, let's go on to Slide 23, and we'll look at Automotive sector cash and cash flow. This is a really great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about 1/3 of the way down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of Automotive operating-related cash flow in the quarter, driven by the profits; and if you look at the full year, the $7.3 billion record at least since 2001, again driven by the very strong profits. And then you can see the uses of the cash below that.
On the lower left, you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level; and then the Automotive debt of $12.8 billion. I just want to stop right here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we've seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company. And generally, that point of view is because people are taking this Automotive debt. They're adding it to the Financial Services debt, which was on a previous page. And of course, the business would look pretty highly leveraged. But that's not the way that investors should look at it. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. 
If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self-funding. Ford Credit also self-liquidates in a downturn and lower volume. And so you think about Ford Credit separately. And then in terms of its own leverage, you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on. And as I mentioned, we've historically been within the 8% to 9% we target, a little bit above because of the translation effect in '15, but we're going to go back into range in 2016.
The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is this: what's on this page, the $12.8 billion. And this is the lowest it's been since 2000. And it's representative of a very good leverage position by the company, along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. So we're in a great shape in terms of the balance sheet, but I just want to clarify that for everyone if you had any questions about that.
Okay. I'm going to wrap up on Slide 24, and this is looking at the planning assumptions and key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year. And all I'll say is we delivered.
If you go to the very bottom of the slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax 5-year average return on invested capital. We came in at 16% in 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 and, in both years, well above the cost of capital.
So Mark, back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up."

We promised to restructure and invest in our operations around the world, and we delivered in both top line and bottom line growth.

If you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital. And what we benefited from was the fact that in 2014, we had the launch of the F-150 and there was a launch effect at the end of the year as well. So we had a drain down, if you will, that was unusual of our working capital. We kind of restored that, replenished that in 2015 and benefited from that. That does not, obviously, repeat in 2016. So that's one of the factors. The other factor, on this slide, you can see favorable other and timing differences. And at least based on what we're seeing right now, for '16, we don't think we're going to benefit to the same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well. So those are the 2 factors that are causing us, at this time, to say that it will still be strong yet not as strong as what you're seeing here on Slide 23.

But we're still seeing a challenging situation there. I think the good news is when you look at our performance on the back of our new products, we actually had positive pricing performance. So I think it's showing that the investments that we're making for our products are paying off. In China, a little bit of a different story, we saw negative pricing in the industry of about 6% last year. We actually saw it probably peak at about 8% in the fourth quarter. Part of that was the purchase tax reduction. And as we go forward into this year, we think we'll see it in that 6% range. And again, we'll see how we go going forward. And in here in North America, I think on the truck side, it's pretty healthy. Obviously, we're seeing more competition on the car side, particularly the sedan side and -- given the migration we're seeing from customers."

And so we decided to move in that direction so that you could clearly see the operating performance of the business. So we developed 8% to 10% before that. So I would say we're back to where we were in terms of the effect of that on the business. And we developed the 8% to 10%, thinking of it as over a longer business cycle. It's not peak. We'd actually like to -- maybe we'll be a bit below that in a downturn. But we'd like, on average, to sort of be around that 8% to 10%. And so we see that as something that we're aspiring to get to. We think with the breakeven that we have with North America that that's probably where we would be. But going forward, as we've said, we're operating at this 10% level. In fact, in 2 of the last 4 years, I think, we were over 11% if I'm not mistaken. So we clearly can go higher, and we're continuing to work to do that. And certainly, Joe is working to stay at the level that we've been the last several years and do even better if possible.

So I think the net of the 2, at the moment -- and again, that changes every day, as you highlighted. But the net of the 2 won't be quite as strong as it was in '15. The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically have already locked in about 1/3 of our commodities exposure either through contracts largely on steel and/or hedging that we do on some of the base metals, including aluminum, which is the second-largest exposure that we have. The other thing is that our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we've identified across the full year largely hedged on key currencies, not every currency, because we leave some unhedged because we believe that they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities. But we lock in some of those commodities, 100%, on an operating basis at the beginning of the year, and that's the position that we're in right now. So we do that not to play the market, but we're trying to reduce the volatility both -- and both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange, operating exchange."

So as we go forward, we're going to be very focused on this and understanding, in some cases, what do we do on our own.

But I don't think that will be as much of a factor in '16 versus '15. But the key point, which is what you mentioned, Rod -- I think someone else just touched on, but the key point is that we just want to highlight that our structural costs aren't necessarily fixed cost, that we've got the ability when volume changes or the economic cycle changes to go and do something about it. I think you can see an example of that in South America, where despite really big headwinds on inflation, we're actually getting net reductions through actions that the team were taking fully around some of these volume-related factors but more broadly across the business. And that flexibility is there. I think the way that perhaps we were showing and talking about the structural cost, that wasn't clear.

In China, obviously, we -- as we mentioned, when you look at the stock market volatility, I mean, that's endemic of a country that's moving from an investment and industry-led economy to one that's consumer-led. And actually, when you look at the components of GDP growth there, the services and the consumer portions of that are actually growing while some of the industry ones are coming down. And we view that as a good sign. It's going to be a bit bumpy as they go through that transition. As we mentioned, in the fourth quarter, you usually see a -- more production by the industry. And by us, that's normal as we get for the -- get ready for the Chinese New Year. We're -- going in, we're in line with our stocks going into January into China. And as I mentioned, China started off -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half versus the first half. But as I mentioned, we really have to wait and see how January and February play out because of where the Chinese New Year falls this year, and we'll get a good sense for that. But our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America, in terms of the industry, we don't see the cycle being over. We -- obviously, the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy cost, those type of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers. And when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, they're the oldest they've ever been, pickup trucks also in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well. As we get into January, what we're seeing, it will probably be a solid month for the industry. But as you know, January is always a bit of a difficult month to call, right, because it's a small industry. There's lots of seasonality. Of course, I hate to turn January always into a weather report, but there's always storms. And obviously, we have that big one on the East Coast. So we could see an industry maybe around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there. But I think it's a little bit of a tricky month. But what we're seeing in our business, commercial sales continue to be strong, and we'll report out on February 2."

We have some very strong results to share with you today. In fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8",899,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today. In fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. 
Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8 billion, and that was $2.1 billion better than 1 year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion and our operating earnings per share was $0.68, and both those results are more than double versus last year. 
Our revenue was $37.7 billion, and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1%, and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe and in our Asia Pacific regions. 
Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8%, and that was a quarterly record. And Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion, and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. 
We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here at North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%. Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter, and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this was also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. 
Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion and pretax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pretax profit and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter. So all in all, very strong start to the year. 
And given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record. So now let's turn to Slide 4. 
And we're continuously focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here, and that's about growth, returns, risk and rewards. So first, let's talk about growth. 
Growth is strong and it's especially evident in our trucks or SUVs and as we pursue expansion into mobility. Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases and investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia; acting decisively in South America; reducing high cost car capacity; of course, increasing efficiencies across the business and leveraging partnerships where we can. 
Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our breakeven levels globally with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend plus a supplemental dividend, and we'll remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and in sharing and maintaining our regular dividend through a downturn. 
So looking at the first quarter on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all 4 focus areas. We grew our top line and announced actions to continue to grow our core business while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility. 
Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P and DBRS. 
And finally, in terms of reports, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion. Looking at Slide 6, among some of the other quarters other highlights. We recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our FX, as the only automaker on the list of the World'S Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand and of course, advances in new technologies and new mobility projects. 
So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on Slide 7. Conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in a global economy. And this will be driven by the U.S, continued modest recovery in the euro area, growth in the U.K. despite probably some increased volatility that we're seeing ahead of the June branded referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016. 
And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. 
So with that, Bob, you want to take it away?"
106335,318732008,965602,"Ford Motor Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent",836,"I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one. 
So first, if I'd ask you to look at the year-over-year performance in the column to the right. Just stand down that column that you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have 2 that we're booking in this quarter. The larger of the 2 was $186 million relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets. 
If you go just above that, you can see our operating EPS of $0.68, $0.39 better than where we were a year ago. So more than doubling that. And if you go down 2 lines to after-tax results or net income, $2.5 billion. Again, we doubled -- more than doubled that particular metric. 
What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago. So with that, let's turn to the next slide. And here, we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes and we'll look at it by segment. So to the far left, you can see that record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to far right, financial services came in very strong at about $500 million. And within that, Ford Credit was $514 million. We have the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million. We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million. And then in South America, we had a loss, as expected. And at least in Africa, we fell in a lost driven by largely the external environment exchange. I'll talk about that in a bit. 
And another Automotive that's largely net interest expense. Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America. We did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million. And that was more than $400 million better than a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide. And we'll start going through the details of the Automotive sector starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics. And as you just see across, you can see all of the very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter. 
Starting at the left. We had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales of revenue up double digits. Revenue in constant exchange was up truly up 15%. We grew our market share, and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3% and that was around North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8%, up sharply. And then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion. Again, up sharply from where we were a year ago. All right. Let's go to the next slide and will look at what was behind the improvement. This is Slide 12. 
The $2 billion improvement. And as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix and favorable cost performance driven by favorable conservation cost. We did have negative net pricing. But within that $548 million decline, there was a one-time stock accrual affect that I'll talk about in just a minute that was over $600 million. 
You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other, we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific. All right. Let's go to the next slide. 
Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance and it was a very, very strong right across the board. Very strong improvement in a top line at over 20%. Revenue, about the same. Market share was up and a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S. And that was driven by 2 things. One, it was the North America and rather, in the U.S. gutless results of that was around SUVs, Transit and F-Series. But also in Canada, we had very strong performance in Canada. We have 1.5 points of share that was driven by F-150 and by the Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record. And then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America."

Fleet's a good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. With us and these customers really well. They use cases. Rental deliveries, as we said before, were frontloaded this year. And this is primarily due to the model to change over, which was, in some of our vehicles, was late last year. And based on rental company request. Because keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible the job one as possible. And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year with government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150 because a lot of the variance have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business. And as you sit can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America."

Let's go to the next slide and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and that was lower cost performance. It was very strong",981,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and that was lower cost performance. It was very strong and some really key parts of the business. Within -- there's 3 or 4 things I'm going to call out here. If you look at the stock performance, $691 million in the callout box for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series. This time last year, we were launching F series -- F-150 rather in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now and we're operating both the Europe 1 and Kansas City at 3 Cruze. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year, making it more normal. So the year-over-year basis, picked up that goodness. 
If you go into mix. Mix and other, about 0.5 billion of that was actually favorable product mix. Again, that was around returning to the normal with F-150. But also year ago, we were launching the old feel price, the Edge, as well as the MKX, and we're benefiting from the fact that, that plant is now up and running and we've got normal supply of those successful products. 
If you go into the net pricing. This one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a one-time stock accrual that's taking place. And most of that, about 80% of that, again, is driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory and we also had very low levels of incentives. So in the first quarter of this recall, of course, we had normal supply. The incentives, while they're still lower than our domestic competitors there at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustments. 
So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. Didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive -- saw the positive net pricing. And then with a favorable mix of that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500 if you exclude lease. Okay, let's go to the next slide. 
We'll look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil because we actually are very encouraged with what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government. The new government has taken such has come into power, very, very positive and really bowled over what we can see from that part of the region in months and years ahead. 
But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%. Revenue was down 44%. Half of that, actually, was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. If we pull back from certain sales that just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability. So we lost share, if you will, in the industry that was down. So the results of that, as we had a sharp decline in the operating margin and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $67 million. And we'll go through that on the next slide, please. Slide 16. 
So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume effect of $91 million. That was Brazil itself down 29%. The team continue to do a great job by cost performance last year. We did over $400 million. In terms of the cost performance, we did $76 million in the quarter. And during the quarter, there's not much effect from this. But during the quarter, we did remove the third crew at come, which is something that I mentioned to the analyst and investors that we're listening on the last call back in March. So the team is still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year, that we'll start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle as it starts to turn around. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. 
Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up while revenue, as reported, was flat. Actually, up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven in terms of markets by Italy, Germany and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. 
The operating margin was over 6%. And again, that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe. Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. So the improvement nearly $500 million came from everything. industries favorable. The volume taxes are favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune within that 160 that's shown on the slide of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years, as well as series mix and options. And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution cost and structural cost. And even though it's not shown on the slides, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually, Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team really delivering across all assets of the business in Europe, and you can see the results of that."

If you recall, a central part of our European Transformation Plan that we launched in the 2012 was continuing to invest in our core business of great product.

And actually our high series models and sports driven has accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. So things like titanium, McNally, operations, Focus and Fiesta and even Mustang, which if you caught this in March, Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, beating folks like Porsche 9 11. So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround, use it as a blue print for Europe and it's paying off."

This is a region also that has many, many challenges externally, geopolitical issues, weak currencies, the number of the markets are major all producers. And so they're suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment, the team basically held on wholesale. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange. As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share, and that was an addict Klein industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran, that was actually is growing and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. 
And that environment, we didn't move into a small loss of $14 million. And that was largely driven by weakness of the South African rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency. All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. 
And another strong quarter driven by new products. Wholesale's up 9%, revenue up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. And here, we also grew share in a region that also was growing. The 80 SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China. So solid performance there. It was really driven by the new products that we had introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the shareholder. We thought share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia. So a lot of good things going on in terms of market performance across the region. 
Our operating margin was over 8% and the pretax results are 2 20. On the lower right of this light, Slide 20 I'm on, I don't think I missed that. You can see their virtual performance read from our China JVs that came at $443 million, that was up sharply over 20% and they generated a margin of 16.4%. 
The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region, India, and Australia. So that was -- it was very encouraging. And let's go to the next slide. This is how we got here. It was largely around volume. So industry share and then the favorable mix of that I had mentioned earlier and this was again driven by the new products. Actually, it's one of the big factors but we saw kludges from the ranger we saw good news from Mondeo and a number of other products. So again, broad-based contribution there."

I should mention that today at 11:00 and the details during the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. And you'll be able to get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that as in the next slides and data here to support this call. So let's go through it. 
On Slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S, and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect to the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pretax results over $500 million, as I mentioned, and up. 
And if we look at some of the matrix U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO store. if you look at the delinquencies, over 60 base, they were only up 1 basis point, loss receivables up 11 basis points, and those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance. So very healthy. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year at $31 million. That was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of refer to the base residual performance at last chat in March. And that was driven by a couple of factors. One, we had losses on units that came in during the quarter and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of a cumulative supplemental depreciation. And that's very much in line with what I said it was chat about that coming in bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million. 
If you look at the credit loss of that was also impacted. There were 2 things here. Charge-off increase related to severities. And then we also had increases to the reserves expectations again of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger. 
Let's go to the next slide of this as an added slight given you some additional metrics around some areas that I know of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at lease performance, the industry has been -- we've been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case in the first quarter, we came in at 26%. Our expectations are that for the full year, we'll come in at a level that will be below that. And again, we're continuing to follow proprietary modeling that we do of fleece making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk whether its geography co-products and so forth. And so we're very comfortable to level of leasing. But that number will come down for the full year. 
On the bottom, just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values. At first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24-month and 36 months auction values versus 1 year ago. We are up sequentially from the first -- from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred. And that is largely based on supply. 
We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have up about 200,000 units coming back this year. Demand for us anyway, it still very healthy and about where it has been. We just have more units coming back. So we have assumed, going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values, and that's built into our guidance. If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experience. Of course, of this is been again an industry trend of longer-term placement terms for us, these over the last number of quarters, we're sort of around that 64-month level. We do have -- we are participating in terms that exceed that. And you can see that on the line, about 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at. 
And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last 5 years, and we generally see that happen a lot, that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit into other alternative financing. If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. 
So very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit. All right, let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at cash. And this is Slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is just it underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see that $3.3 billion of Automotive pretax profit, over 80% of that flow right through the cash flow. So very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some paydown of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year. And then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned. In addition, the quarter, we completed to the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. 
And then with very strong liquidity and unnoted debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange in some noncash debt changes. 
Okay. And with that, going to turn it over to Mark."

So Slide 26 summarizes our industry and our GDP planning assumptions going forward. And again, all in all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the auto industry sales globally and for the major markets and that you see on the slide here. And our expectations for our full year industry sales by market are unchanged. 
I won't go through Slide 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance. We're through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and will continue to Focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record. So just kind of bring it all together on Slide 29. 
The first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company with very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further. And again, focusing on those 4 key areas that drive creating value in the company: Growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
Importantly, we're building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company, and also, taking advantage of emerging opportunities to Ford Smart Mobility. And importantly, as we grow, we're committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. 
So I guess, the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year with sustained, strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our Focus on innovation in all areas of our business and driving improved mix, they're driving improved mix, strong business structure and of course, exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with record performance. 
So we're proud of our achievements. With the full understanding that we have to continually earn them, we're excited about the future. And we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risk across the entire company. 
So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions."

And then also, likewise on the positive side, I guess, I think I was quite surprised by the extent of benefit from lower variable cost, right?

So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million. And that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual side, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter in terms of a run rate is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing us. Because last year, we largely did have what we have the new product, we had very low levels of incentives because of how type of inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume coming back to more normal levels. But still, better than our key competitors. So I think that's largely what's applied. We're seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKS. Although again, Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter. In terms of the contribution cost. Again, I think it's the same factor. We don't -- we didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related cost, new product cost. Because we have F-Series largely in the quarter last year, not a lot of volume, but it was there. So as a result, what you can seize a great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of maturely efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on down in that warranty freight. Another one of that was for it. Have a lot of freemium rate in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches. And so that's coming through. One thing maybe I'll take it the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank that we didn't think we'll see as much benefit and commodities this year. That clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline in commodities, I think. Last year, we did have, I think it was $930 million, the good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we're tracking to something like that. I just don't think we'll have a little more bank news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the 2 still going to be bit more good news than what we had expected."

It was a bit different last because of the launches but this is going to be more normal year. Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that will put take place in the third quarter while we'll be able to take that in terms of down weeks within the normal schedule, December downtime, you still have the lunch curve, which is going to take some volume out, which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty start today because we don't anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get into that whole launch. So that's a key factor. In terms of tweaking production for inventory, that's just going to be them normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand and inventory, and we'll adjust as we go forward. But it's really those first 2 factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. So it's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe, too."

There's still a lot of cars here in the U.S. It's going to take a long time even with a breakthrough technologies where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time. And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous or semi autonomous or all the connected cars will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? I mean, from our standpoint, we're looking at this as, first off, it's too early to tell. But we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that in urban areas, there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales. But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24/7, they rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue. And ultimately, more car sales. So I think its still too early to tell him. But our strategy, very clearly is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams."

Anything that's the right level given of the market is. To think that I would mention is that for us, there's a much lower percentage of leasing in Ford anyway on super duties and F-150s, on trucks. That has not been -- that's been generally true across the industry, although some of our competitors pretty heavy on that in the first quarter and some of the reasons of the country. We didn't participate in that. So I think that's another factor as well, just a natural mix of product."

We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8",900,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. 
Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8 billion, and that was $2.1 billion better than a year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion, and our operating earnings per share was $0.68, and both those results are more than double versus last year. 
Our revenue was $37.7 billion, and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1%, and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe and in our Asia Pacific regions. 
Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8%, and that was a quarterly record. And Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion, and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. 
We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here at North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%. Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter, and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this is also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. 
Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion, and pretax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pretax profit, and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter. 
So all in all, a very strong start to the year. And given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record. 
So now let's turn to Slide 4. And we're continuously focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here, and that's about growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
So first, let's talk about growth. Growth is strong, and it's especially evident in our trucks or SUVs and as we pursue expansion into mobility. Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases and investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia; acting decisively in South America; reducing high cost car capacity; of course, increasing efficiencies across the business; and leveraging partnerships where we can. 
Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our breakeven levels globally, with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend plus a supplemental dividend, and we'll remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and ensuring we're maintaining our regular dividend through a downturn. 
So looking at the first quarter on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all 4 focus areas. We grew our top line and announced actions to continue to grow our core business while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility. Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. 
In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P and DBRS. And finally, in terms of rewards, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion. 
Looking at Slide 6, among some of the other quarters' other highlights. We were recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our FX, as the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand and, of course, advances in new technologies and new mobility projects. 
So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on Slide 7. Conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in a global economy. And this will be driven by the U.S.; continued modest recovery in the euro area; growth in the U.K. despite, probably, some increased volatility that we're seeing ahead of the June Brexit referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016. 
And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. 
So with that, Bob, you want to take it away?"
106335,318732008,965929,"Ford Motor Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent",841,"I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one. 
So first, if I'd ask you to look at the year-over-year performance on the column to the right. Just stand down that column and you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have 2 that we're booking in this quarter. The larger of the 2 with $186 million relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets. 
If you go just above that, you can see our operating EPS of $0.68, $0.39 better than where we were a year ago, so more than doubling that. And if you go down 2 lines to aftertax results or net income, the $2.5 billion, again, we doubled -- more than doubled that particular metric. What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago. 
So with that, let's turn to the next slide. And here, we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes, and we'll look at it by segment. So to the far left, you can see a record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to the far right, financial services came in very strong at about $500 million. And within that, Ford Credit was $514 million. We have the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million. We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million. And then in South America, we had a loss, as expected. And at least in Africa, we fell in to a loss driven by, largely, the external environment exchange. I'll talk about that in a bit. And in other Automotive, that's largely net interest expense. 
Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America, we did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million. And that was more than $400 million better than a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll start going through the details of the Automotive sector, starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics. And as you just scan across, you can see all of them very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter. 
Starting at the left. We had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales and revenue, up double digits. Revenue at constant exchange was actually up 15%. We grew our market share, and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3%, and that was around North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8%, up sharply. And then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion, again, up sharply from where we were a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what was behind the improvement. This is Slide 12. A $2 billion improvement, and as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix and favorable cost performance driven by favorable contribution cost. We did have negative net pricing, but within that $548 million decline, there was a onetime stock accrual effect that I'll talk about in just a minute that was over $600 million. 
You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other, we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide. Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance, and it was very, very strong right across the board. Very strong improvement in the top line at over 20%; revenue, about the same. Market share was up and a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S., and that was driven by 2 things. One, it was the North America and -- rather, in the U.S. It was fleet sales that was around SUVs, Transit and F-Series. But also in Canada, we had very strong performance in Canada. We are at 1.5 points of share that was driven by F-150 and by the Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record. And then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America."

Fleet's a good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. We understand these customers really well, their use cases. Rental deliveries, as we said before, were frontloaded this year. And this is primarily due to the model year changeover, which was, in some of our vehicles, was late last year, and based on rental company request. Because keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible to job one as possible. And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year, with government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150 because a lot of the variance have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business. And as you can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America."

Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong",988,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong and some really key parts of the business. Within -- there's 3 or 4 things I'm going to call out here. If you look at the stock performance, $691 million in the callout box here for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series. This time last year, we were launching F-series -- F-150, rather, in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now, and we're operating both Dearborn and Kansas City at 3 crews. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year and making it more normal. So in a year-over-year basis, picked up that good news.
If you go into mix. Mix and other, about 0.5 billion of that was actually favorable product mix. Again, that was around returning to the normal with F-150. But also, a year ago, we were launching the Oakville products, the Edge as well as the MKX. And we're benefiting from the fact that, that plant is now up and running, and we've got normal supply of those successful products. 
If you go into the net pricing. This one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other of negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a onetime stock accrual that's taking place. And most of that, about 80% of it, again, is driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory, and we also had very low levels of incentives. So in the first quarter of this year, of course, we had normal supply. The incentives, while they're still lower than our domestic competitors, they're at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustments. 
So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. It didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive, small but positive net pricing. And then with a favorable mix that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500 if you exclude lease. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide. We'll look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil, because we actually are very encouraged with what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government -- the new government has taken, since it has come into power. Very, very positive and really bodes well for what we can see from that part of the region in months and years ahead. 
But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%. Revenue was down 44%. Half of that, actually, was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. As we pull back from certain sales that just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability, so we lost share, if you will, in the industry that was down. So the results of that is we had a sharp decline in the operating margin, and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $67 million. And we'll go through that on the next slide, please. 
Slide 16. So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume effect of $91 million. That was Brazil itself, down 29%. The team continue to do a great job in cost performance last year. We did over $400 million. In terms of the cost performance, we did $76 million in the quarter. And during the quarter, there's not much effect from this, but during the quarter, we did remove the third crew at Camaçari, which is something I mentioned to the analysts and investors that we're listening then on the Let's Chat call back in March. 
So the team is still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year, that we'll start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle, and it starting to turn around. 
Let's go to the next slide, and we'll turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up while revenue, as reported, was flat. Actually, up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven, in terms of markets, by Italy, Germany and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. The operating margin was over 6%. And again, that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe. 
Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. So the improvement, nearly $500 million, came from everything. Industry was favorable. The volume taxes were favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune within that $160 million that's shown on the slide of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years as well as series mix and options. 
And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution cost and structural cost. And even though it's not shown on the slides, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually, Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team, really delivering across all aspects of the business in Europe, and you can see the results of that."

If you recall, a central part of our European transformation plan that we launched in the 2012 was continuing to invest in our core business of great products. And as you can see from the results here, it's really starting to pay off. Actually, our average transaction prices in Europe, on a year-over-year basis, were up over $1,200. And actually our high-series models and sports derivatives accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. So things like titanium, Vignale, ST versions of Focus and Fiesta, and even Mustang, which if you caught this in March, Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, beating folks like Porsche 911. So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround, we've used it as a blue print for Europe, and it's paying off."

This is a region also that has many, many challenges externally, geopolitical issues, weak currencies. A number of the markets are major all producers, and so they're suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment, the team basically held on wholesales. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange. As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share, and that was in a declining industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran, which actually is growing and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. 
In that environment, we did move into a small loss of $14 million, and that was largely driven by weakness of the South African rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency. 
All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. We had another strong quarter driven by new products. For the wholesales, up 9%; revenue, up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. And here, we also grew share in a region that also was growing. The AP SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China. So strong performance there. It was really driven by the new products that we had introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the share. But we saw share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia, so a lot of good things going on in terms of market performance across the region. 
Our operating margin was over 8%, and the pretax results at $220 million. 
On the lower right of this slide, Slide 20, I'm on, I don't think I mentioned that. You can see the very strong performance we have from our China JVs that came at $443 million, that was up sharply, over 20%, and they generated a margin of 16.4%. 
The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region, India, ASEAN and Australia. So that was very encouraging. 
Let's go to the next slide. And this is how we got here. It was largely around volume. So industry share and then the favorable mix that I had mentioned earlier, and this was, again, driven by the new products. Edge was one of the big factors, but we saw good news from the Ranger, we saw good news from Mondeo and a number of other products. So again, a broad-based contribution there."

And I think the investments that we've made over the last couple of years have a full lineup of SUVs, small, medium and large, is really great for timing of the market. And at the same time, we introduced the Raptor. And I had to tell you, I literally had to, as we were done presenting it, run out of the way because of the people running off to the vehicle. And I think that vehicle will do well, not only just from a sales standpoint, it won't play a major role, but we'll sell, I think, every one we can, but what it will do to continue to accelerate the perception of our brand."

Let's move on to another part of the business we absolutely love, that's Ford Credit. I should mention that today at 11:00 and the details are in the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. And you'll be able to get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that as an extra slides and data here to support this call. So let's go through it. 
On Slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S, and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect in the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pretax results, over $500 million, as I mentioned, and up. 
And if we look at some of the metrics around U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO store. If you look at the delinquencies, over 60 days, they were only up 1 basis point; loss receivables, up 11 basis points. And those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance. So very healthy. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year at $31 million that was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of referred to the base residual performance at Let's Chat in March. And that was driven by a couple of factors. One, we had the losses on units that came in during the quarter, and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of a cumulative supplemental depreciation. And that's very much in line with what I said in the Let's Chat about that metric coming in bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million. 
If you look at the credit loss, that was also impacted. There were 2 things here. Charge-offs increased related to severities. And then we also had increases to the reserves expectations again of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger. 
Let's go to the next slide, and this is an added slide, giving you some additional metrics around some areas that I know of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at lease performance, the industry has been -- we've been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was at 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case in the first quarter, we came at 26%. Our expectations are that, for the full year, we'll come in at a level that will be below that. And again, we're continuing to follow a proprietary modeling that we do of lease, making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk, whether it's geographical, products, series and so forth. And so we're very comfortable to the level of leasing, but that number will come down for the full year. 
On the bottom, just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values at first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24-month and 36-months auction values versus a year ago. We are up sequentially from the first -- from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred. And that is largely based on supply. 
We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have up about 200,000 units coming back this year. Demand for us, anyway, is still very healthy and about where it has been. We just have more units coming back. So we have assumed, going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values, and that's built into our guidance. 
If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experience. Of course, this has been, again, an industry trend of longer-term placement terms for us. At least over the last number of quarters, we're sort of around that 64-month level. We do have -- we are participating in terms that exceed that, and you can see that on the line. About 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at. 
And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see, we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last 5 years, and we generally see that happen a lot, that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit into other alternative financing. 
If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. So a very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at cash, and this is Slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is it just underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see the $3.3 billion of Automotive pretax profit, over 80% of that flew right through the cash flow. So a very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some paydown of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year, and then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned. In addition, in the quarter, we completed to the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. 
And then with very strong liquidity and unnoted debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange and some noncash debt changes. 
Okay. And with that, I'm going to turn you over to Mark Fields."

So Slide 26 summarizes our industry and our GDP planning assumptions going forward. And again, all in all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the automotive industry sales globally and for the major markets that you see on the slide here. And our expectations for the full year industry sales by market are unchanged. 
I won't go through Slides 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance. We're through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and we'll continue to focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record. 
So just kind of bringing it all together on Slide 29. The first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company, with very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further. And again, focusing on those 4 key areas that drive creating value in the company: growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
Importantly, we're building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company, and also, taking advantage of emerging opportunities to Ford Smart Mobility. And importantly, as we grow, we're committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. 
So I guess, the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year, with sustained, strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our focus on innovation in all areas of our business and driving improved mix -- they're driving improved mix, a strong business structure and, of course, exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with record performance. 
So we're proud of our achievements, with the full understanding that we have to continually earn them. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risks across the entire company. 
So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions."

So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million. And that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual side, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter, in terms of a run rate, is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing us. Because last year, we largely did have -- while we have the new product, we have very low levels of incentives because of how tight the inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume, coming back to more normal levels. But still, better than our key competitors. So I think that's largely what's at play. We are seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKX. Although again, Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're actually seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter. In terms of the contribution cost. Again, I think it's the same factor. We don't -- we didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related cost, new product cost. Because we have F-Series largely in the quarter last year, not a lot of volume, but it was there. Edge was there. So as a result, all you can see is the great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of material efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on down in that warranty freight, and another line of that was freight. We have a lot of premium freight in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches. And so that's coming through. One thing maybe I'll take it -- the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank, that we didn't think we'd see as much benefit on commodities this year, that clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline in commodities, I think. Last year, we did have, I think it was $930 million, the good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we're tracking to something like that. I still think we'll have a little more bad news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the 2 are still going to be a bit more good news than what we had expected."

What we're really seeing in the second half is primarily around 2 other factors. One is normal seasonality. You've got both here and in Europe, and I think in Europe, you have more summer shutdown weeks. You also have the shutdowns that occurred at the end of the year. So it's just normal to have less production and therefore, less wholesales in the second half than the first half. It was a bit different last year because of the launches, but this is going to be a more normal year. Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that'll take place in the third quarter. While we'll be able to contain that in terms of the down weeks within the normal scheduled December downtime, you still have the launch curve, which is going to take some volume out, which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty stock today because we have to anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get through that whole launch. And so that's a key factor. In terms of tweaking production for inventory, that's just going to be the normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand and inventory, and we'll adjust as we go forward. But it's really those first 2 factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. So it's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe, too."

I wouldn't put them off the table, but at the same token, what's really important is this Ford Smart Mobility group is working very tightly with our core operations. And I guess, where we're at on Ford Smart Mobility, we're very focused at them on where to play and how to win.

Because at the end of the day, you want to make money on these things. And we're doing that before we make, what I would call, major bets on investments, whether it's internally or externally.

So when you look at the -- your comment around, is there going to be a super cycle? Listen, I mean, there's hundreds of millions of cars, over 100 million cars here or 100 -- I can't remember exactly the numbers. There's a lot of cars here in the U.S. It's going to take a long time, even with breakthrough technologies, where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time. And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous or semiautonomous or all the connected cars, will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? I mean, from our standpoint, we're looking at this as, first off, it's too early to tell. But we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that, in urban areas, there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales. But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24/7, they'll rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue and, ultimately, more car sales. So I think it's still too early to tell, but our strategy, very clearly, is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams."

So that was the neutral bit. It was good news commodities would be offset by bad news on exchange. What I said earlier in the call, Joe, is that now we see commodities as being more favorable than what we thought because the prices just continue to fall. So I think we'll see commodities about as much of good news, based on where we are today as we saw last year, which was over $900 million, but we will still have more bad news on a year-over-year basis from exchange.

We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8",900,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. 
Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8 billion, and that was $2.1 billion better than a year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion, and our operating earnings per share was $0.68, and both those results are more than double versus last year. 
Our revenue was $37.7 billion, and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1%, and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe and in our Asia Pacific regions. 
Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8%, and that was a quarterly record. And Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion, and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. 
We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here at North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%. Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter, and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this is also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. 
Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion, and pretax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pretax profit, and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter. 
So all in all, a very strong start to the year. And given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record. 
So now let's turn to Slide 4. And we're continuously focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here, and that's about growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
So first, let's talk about growth. Growth is strong, and it's especially evident in our trucks or SUVs and as we pursue expansion into mobility. Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases and investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia; acting decisively in South America; reducing high cost car capacity; of course, increasing efficiencies across the business; and leveraging partnerships where we can. 
Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our breakeven levels globally, with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend plus a supplemental dividend, and we'll remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and ensuring we're maintaining our regular dividend through a downturn. 
So looking at the first quarter on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all 4 focus areas. We grew our top line and announced actions to continue to grow our core business while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility. Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. 
In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P and DBRS. And finally, in terms of rewards, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion. 
Looking at Slide 6, among some of the other quarters' other highlights. We were recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our ethics, as the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand and, of course, advances in new technologies and new mobility projects. 
So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on Slide 7. Conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in a global economy. And this will be driven by the U.S.; continued modest recovery in the euro area; growth in the U.K. despite, probably, some increased volatility that we're seeing ahead of the June Brexit referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016. 
And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. 
So with that, Bob, you want to take it away?"
106335,318732008,966367,"Ford Motor Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent",841,"I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one. 
So first, if I'd ask you to look at the year-over-year performance on the column to the right. Just scan down that column and you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have 2 that we're booking in this quarter. The larger of the 2 with $186 million relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets. 
If you go just above that, you can see our operating EPS of $0.68, $0.39 better than where we were a year ago, so more than doubling that. And if you go down 2 lines to aftertax results or net income, the $2.5 billion, again, we doubled -- more than doubled that particular metric. What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago. 
So with that, let's turn to the next slide. And here, we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes, and we'll look at it by segment. So to the far left, you can see a record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to the far right, financial services came in very strong at about $500 million. And within that, Ford Credit was $514 million. We had the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million. We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million. And then in South America, we had a loss, as expected. And in Middle East and Africa, we fell in to a loss driven by, largely, the external environment exchange. I'll talk about that in a bit. And in other Automotive, that's largely net interest expense. 
Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America, we did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million. And that was more than $400 million better than a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll start going through the details of the Automotive sector, starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics. And as you just scan across, you can see all of them very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter. 
Starting at the left. We had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales and revenue, up double digits. Revenue at constant exchange was actually up 15%. We grew our market share, and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3%, and that was around North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8%, up sharply. And then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion, again, up sharply from where we were a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what was behind the improvement. This is Slide 12. A $2 billion improvement, and as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix and favorable cost performance driven by favorable contribution cost. We did have negative net pricing, but within that $548 million decline, there was a onetime stock accrual effect that I'll talk about in just a minute that was over $600 million. 
You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other, we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide. Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance, and it was very, very strong right across the board. Very strong improvement in the top line at over 20%; revenue, about the same. Market share was up and a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S., and that was driven by 2 things. One, it was the North America and -- rather, in the U.S. It was fleet sales that was around SUVs, Transit and F-Series. But also in Canada, we had very strong performance in Canada. We are at 1.5 points of share that was driven by F-150 and by Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record. And then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America."

Fleet's a good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. We understand these customers really well, their use cases. Rental deliveries, as we said before, were frontloaded this year. And this is primarily due to the model year changeover, which was, in some of our vehicles, was late last year, and based on rental company request. Because keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible to job one as possible. And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year, with government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150 because a lot of the variance have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business. And as you can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America."

As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong",991,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong in some really key parts of the business. Within -- there's 3 or 4 things I'm going to call out here. If you look at the stock performance, $691 million in the callout box here for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series. This time last year, we were launching F-series -- F-150, rather, in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now, and we're operating both Dearborn and Kansas City at 3 crews. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year and making it more normal. So in a year-over-year basis, picked up that good news.
If you go into mix. Mix and other, about 0.5 billion of that was actually favorable product mix. Again, that was around returning to the normal with F-150. But also, a year ago, we were launching the Oakville products, the Edge as well as the MKX. And we're benefiting from the fact that, that plant is now up and running, and we've got normal supply of those successful products. 
If you go into the net pricing. This one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other of negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a onetime stock accrual that's taking place. And most of that, about 80% of it, again, is driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory, and we also had very low levels of incentives. So in the first quarter of this year, of course, we had normal supply. The incentives, while they're still lower than our domestic competitors, they're at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustments. 
So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. It didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive, small but positive net pricing. And then with a favorable mix that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500 if you exclude lease. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide. We'll look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil, because we actually are very encouraged with what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government -- the new government has taken, since it has come into power. Very, very positive and really bodes well for what we can see from that part of the region in months and years ahead. 
But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%. Revenue was down 44%. Half of that, actually, was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. As we pull back from certain sales that just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability, so we lost share, if you will, in the industry that was down. So the results of that is we had a sharp decline in the operating margin, and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $6 million to $7 million. And we'll go through that on the next slide, please. 
Slide 16. So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume effect of $91 million. That was Brazil itself, down 29%. The team continue to do a great job in cost performance last year. We did over $400 million. In terms of the cost performance, we did $76 million in the quarter. And during the quarter, there's not much effect from this, but during the quarter, we did remove the third crew at Camaçari, which is something I mentioned to the analysts and investors that we're listening then on the Let's Chat call back in March. 
So the team is still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year, that we'll start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle, and it starts to turn around. 
Let's go to the next slide, and we'll turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up while revenue, as reported, was flat. Actually, up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven, in terms of markets, by Italy, Germany and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. The operating margin was over 6%. And again, that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe. 
Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. So the improvement, nearly $500 million, came from everything. Industry was favorable. The volume taxes were favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune, within that $160 million that's shown on the slide, of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years as well as series mix and options. 
And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution cost and structural cost. And even though it's not shown on the slide, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually, Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team, really delivering across all aspects of the business in Europe, and you can see the results of that."

And actually our high-series models and sports derivatives accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. So things like Titanium, Vignale, ST versions of Focus and Fiesta, and even Mustang, which if you caught this in March, Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, beating folks like Porsche 911. So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround, we've used it as a blue print for Europe, and it's paying off."

This is a region also that has many, many challenges externally, geopolitical issues, weak currencies. A number of the markets are major all producers, and so they're suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment, the team basically held on wholesales. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange. As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share, and that was in a declining industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran out, which actually is growing and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. 
In that environment, we did move into a small loss of $14 million, and that was largely driven by weakness of the South African rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency. 
All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. We had another strong quarter driven by new products. For the wholesales, up 9%; revenue, up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. And here, we also grew share in a region that also was growing. The AP SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China. So strong performance there. It was really driven by the new products that we had introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the share. But we saw share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia, so a lot of good things going on in terms of market performance across the region. 
Our operating margin was over 8%, and the pretax results at $220 million. 
On the lower right of this slide, Slide 20, I'm on, I don't think I mentioned that. You can see the very strong performance we have from our China JVs that came at $443 million, that was up sharply, over 20%, and they generated a margin of 16.4%. 
The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region, India, ASEAN and Australia. So that was very encouraging. 
Let's go to the next slide. And this is how we got here. It was largely around volume. So industry share and then the favorable mix that I had mentioned earlier, and this was, again, driven by the new products. Edge was one of the big factors, but we saw good news from the Ranger, we saw good news from Mondeo and a number of other products. So again, a broad-based contribution there."

Let's move on to another part of the business we absolutely love, that's Ford Credit. I should mention that today at 11:00 and the details are in the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. And you'll be able to get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that as an extra slides and data here to support this call. So let's go through it. 
On Slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S, and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect in the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pretax results, over $500 million, as I mentioned, and up. 
And if we look at some of the metrics around U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO store. If you look at the delinquencies, over 60 days, they were only up 1 basis point; loss receivables, up 11 basis points. And those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance. So very healthy. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year at $31 million that was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of referred to the base residual performance at Let's Chat in March. And that was driven by a couple of factors. One, we had the losses on units that came in during the quarter, and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of a cumulative supplemental depreciation. And that's very much in line with what I said in the Let's Chat about that metric coming in bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million. 
If you look at the credit loss, that was also impacted. There were 2 things here. Charge-offs increased related to severities. And then we also had increases to the reserves expectations again of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger. 
Let's go to the next slide, and this is an added slide, giving you some additional metrics around some areas that I know are of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at lease performance, the industry has been -- we've been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was at 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case in the first quarter, we came at 26%. Our expectations are that, for the full year, we'll come in at a level that will be below that. And again, we're continuing to follow a proprietary modeling that we do of lease, making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk, whether it's geographical, product series and so forth. And so we're very comfortable to the level of leasing, but that number will come down for the full year. 
On the bottom, just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values at first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24-month and 36-months auction values versus a year ago. We are up sequentially from the first -- from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred. And that is largely based on supply. 
We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have about 200,000 units coming back this year. Demand for us, anyway, is still very healthy and about where it has been. We just have more units coming back. So we have assumed, going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values, and that's built into our guidance. 
If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experience. Of course, this has been, again, an industry trend of longer-term placement terms for us. At least over the last number of quarters, we're sort of around that 64-month level. We do have -- we are participating in terms that exceed that, and you can see that on the line. About 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at. 
And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see, we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last 5 years, and we generally see that happen a lot, that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit than to other alternative financing. 
If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. So a very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at cash, and this is Slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is it just underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see the $3.3 billion of Automotive pretax profit, over 80% of that flew right through the cash flow. So a very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some paydown of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year, and then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned. In addition, in the quarter, we completed to the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. 
And then with very strong liquidity and unnoted debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange and some noncash debt changes. 
Okay. And with that, I'm going to turn you over to Mark Fields."

And again, all in all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the automotive industry sales globally and for the major markets that you see on the slide here.

I won't go through Slides 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance. We're through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and we'll continue to focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record. 
So just kind of bringing it all together on Slide 29. The first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company, with very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further. And again, focusing on those 4 key areas that drive creating value in the company: growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
Importantly, we're building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company, and also, taking advantage of emerging opportunities to Ford Smart Mobility. And importantly, as we grow, we're committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. 
So I guess, the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year, with sustained, strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our focus on innovation in all areas of our business and driving improved mix -- they're driving improved mix, a strong business structure and, of course, exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with record performance. 
So we're proud of our achievements, with the full understanding that we have to continually earn them. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risks across the entire company.

So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million. And that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual aside, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter, in terms of a run rate, is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing us. Because last year, we largely did have -- while we had the new product, we have very low levels of incentives because of how tight the inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume, coming back to more normal levels. But still, better than our key competitors. So I think that's largely what's at play. We are seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKX. Although again, Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're actually seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter. In terms of the contribution cost. Again, I think it's the same factor. We don't -- we didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related costs, new product cost. Because we had F-Series largely in the quarter last year, not a lot of volume, but it was there. Edge was there. So as a result, all you can see is the great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of material efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on, down in that warranty freight, and other line, that was freight. We have a lot of premium freight in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches. And so that's coming through. One thing maybe I'll take it -- the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank, that we didn't think we'd see as much benefit on commodities this year, that clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline commodities, I think. Last year, we did have, I think it was $930 million, the good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we're tracking to something like that. I still think we'll have a little more bad news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the 2 are still going to be a bit more good news than what we had expected."

What we're really seeing in the second half is primarily around 2 other factors. One is normal seasonality. You've got both here and in Europe, and I think in Europe, you have more summer shutdown weeks. You also have the shutdowns that occurred at the end of the year. So it's just normal to have less production and therefore, less wholesales in the second half than the first half. It was a bit different last year because of the launches, but this is going to be a more normal year. Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that'll take place in the third quarter. While we'll be able to contain that in terms of the down weeks within the normal scheduled summer downtime, you still have the launch curve, which is going to take some volume out, which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty stock today because we have to anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get through that whole launch. And so that's a key factor. In terms of tweaking production for inventory, that's just going to be the normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand and inventory, and we'll adjust as we go forward. But it's really those first 2 factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. So it's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe, too."

And then as the year progresses, what is your outlook for both the headwind from used car prices and the tailwind from the offsetting factors?"

So we think -- and we built that in, as I mentioned. In March, we do have an expectation of lower auction values, and that's particularly on the car side of the business, but we have built that in. So I think that will be, on a year-over-year basis, the headwind, although, again, mitigating towards the end of the year. But that will be offset by strong growth of the business, not only in North America, but in other parts of the world as well. So I think that will be an offset. And again, the other thing I should mention is the team is really, really focused on cost performance. Our operating cost performance is the best in the business. And that will continue to be something that will keep us lean and mean and enable Ford Credit to continue to generate the types of profitability that it has."

I wouldn't put them off the table, but at the same token, what's really important is this Ford Smart Mobility group is working very tightly with our core operations. And I guess, where we're at on Ford Smart Mobility, we're very focused at them on where to play and how to win.

Because at the end of the day, you want to make money on these things. And we're doing that before we make, what I would call, major bets on investments, whether it's internally or externally.

We've said that we are going to see -- we're in an inflection point as an industry over the next number of years, given the technology that's available, not only to -- in the products itself, but how to serve the customer. So when you look at the -- your comment around, is there going to be a super cycle? Listen, I mean, there's hundreds of millions of cars, over 100 million cars here or 100 -- I can't remember exactly the numbers. There's a lot of cars here in the U.S. It's going to take a long time, even with breakthrough technologies, where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time. And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous or semiautonomous or all the connected cars, will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? I mean, from our standpoint, we're looking at this as, first off, it's too early to tell. But we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that, in urban areas, there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales. But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24/7, they'll rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue and, ultimately, more car sales. So I think it's still too early to tell, but our strategy, very clearly, is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams."

We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8",900,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today, in fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. 
Our company pretax profit came in at $3.8 billion, and that was $2.1 billion better than a year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion, and our operating earnings per share was $0.68, and both those results are more than double versus last year. 
Our revenue was $37.7 billion, and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1%, and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe and in our Asia Pacific regions. 
Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8%, and that was a quarterly record. And Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion, and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. 
We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here at North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%. Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter, and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this is also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. 
Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion, and pretax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pretax profit, and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter. 
So all in all, a very strong start to the year. And given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record. 
So now let's turn to Slide 4. And we're continuously focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here, and that's about growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
So first, let's talk about growth. Growth is strong, and it's especially evident in our trucks or SUVs and as we pursue expansion into mobility. Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases and investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia; acting decisively in South America; reducing high cost car capacity; of course, increasing efficiencies across the business; and leveraging partnerships where we can. 
Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our breakeven levels globally, with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend plus a supplemental dividend, and we'll remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and ensuring we're maintaining our regular dividend through a downturn. 
So looking at the first quarter on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all 4 focus areas. We grew our top line and announced actions to continue to grow our core business while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility. Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. 
In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P and DBRS. And finally, in terms of rewards, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion. 
Looking at Slide 6, among some of the other quarters' other highlights. We were recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our ethics, as the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand and, of course, advances in new technologies and new mobility projects. 
So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on Slide 7. Conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in a global economy. And this will be driven by the U.S.; continued modest recovery in the euro area; growth in the U.K. despite, probably, some increased volatility that we're seeing ahead of the June Brexit referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016. 
And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. 
So with that, Bob, you want to take it away?"
106335,318732008,967090,"Ford Motor Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent",841,"I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on Slide 9 by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also of the Automotive and the financial services sector. Now because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one. 
So first, if I'd ask you to look at the year-over-year performance on the column to the right. Just scan down that column and you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have 2 that we're booking in this quarter. The larger of the 2 with $186 million relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets. 
If you go just above that, you can see our operating EPS of $0.68, $0.39 better than where we were a year ago, so more than doubling that. And if you go down 2 lines to aftertax results or net income, the $2.5 billion, again, we doubled -- more than doubled that particular metric. What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago. 
So with that, let's turn to the next slide. And here, we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes, and we'll look at it by segment. So to the far left, you can see a record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to the far right, financial services came in very strong at about $500 million. And within that, Ford Credit was $514 million. We had the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million. We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million. And then in South America, we had a loss, as expected. And in Middle East and Africa, we fell in to a loss driven by, largely, the external environment exchange. I'll talk about that in a bit. And in other Automotive, that's largely net interest expense. 
Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America, we did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million. And that was more than $400 million better than a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll start going through the details of the Automotive sector, starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics. And as you just scan across, you can see all of them very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter. 
Starting at the left. We had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales and revenue, up double digits. Revenue at constant exchange was actually up 15%. We grew our market share, and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3%, and that was around North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8%, up sharply. And then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion, again, up sharply from where we were a year ago. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what was behind the improvement. This is Slide 12. A $2 billion improvement, and as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix and favorable cost performance driven by favorable contribution cost. We did have negative net pricing, but within that $548 million decline, there was a onetime stock accrual effect that I'll talk about in just a minute that was over $600 million. 
You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other, we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide. Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance, and it was very, very strong right across the board. Very strong improvement in the top line at over 20%; revenue, about the same. Market share was up and a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S., and that was driven by 2 things. One, it was the North America and -- rather, in the U.S. It was fleet sales that was around SUVs, Transit and F-Series. But also in Canada, we had very strong performance in Canada. We are at 1.5 points of share that was driven by F-150 and by Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record. And then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America."

Fleet's a good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. We understand these customers really well, their use cases. Rental deliveries, as we said before, were frontloaded this year. And this is primarily due to the model year changeover, which was, in some of our vehicles, was late last year, and based on rental company request. Because keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible to job one as possible. And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year, with government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150 because a lot of the variance have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business. And as you can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America."
106335,318732008,967090,"Ford Motor Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong",991,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix and it was lower cost performance. It was very strong in some really key parts of the business. Within -- there's 3 or 4 things I'm going to call out here. If you look at the stock performance, $691 million in the callout box here for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series. This time last year, we were launching F-series -- F-150, rather, in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now, and we're operating both Dearborn and Kansas City at 3 crews. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year and making it more normal. So in a year-over-year basis, picked up that good news.
If you go into mix. Mix and other, about 0.5 billion of that was actually favorable product mix. Again, that was around returning to the normal with F-150. But also, a year ago, we were launching the Oakville products, the Edge as well as the MKX. And we're benefiting from the fact that, that plant is now up and running, and we've got normal supply of those successful products. 
If you go into the net pricing. This one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other of negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a onetime stock accrual that's taking place. And most of that, about 80% of it, again, is driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory, and we also had very low levels of incentives. So in the first quarter of this year, of course, we had normal supply. The incentives, while they're still lower than our domestic competitors, they're at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustments. 
So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. It didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive, small but positive net pricing. And then with a favorable mix that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500 if you exclude lease. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide. We'll look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil, because we actually are very encouraged with what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government -- the new government has taken, since it has come into power. Very, very positive and really bodes well for what we can see from that part of the region in months and years ahead. 
But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%. Revenue was down 44%. Half of that, actually, was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. As we pull back from certain sales that just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability, so we lost share, if you will, in the industry that was down. So the results of that is we had a sharp decline in the operating margin, and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $6 million to $7 million. And we'll go through that on the next slide, please. 
Slide 16. So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume effect of $91 million. That was Brazil itself, down 29%. The team continue to do a great job in cost performance last year. We did over $400 million. In terms of the cost performance, we did $76 million in the quarter. And during the quarter, there's not much effect from this, but during the quarter, we did remove the third crew at Camaçari, which is something I mentioned to the analysts and investors that we're listening then on the Let's Chat call back in March. 
So the team is still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year, that we'll start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle, and it starts to turn around. 
Let's go to the next slide, and we'll turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up while revenue, as reported, was flat. Actually, up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven, in terms of markets, by Italy, Germany and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. The operating margin was over 6%. And again, that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe. 
Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. So the improvement, nearly $500 million, came from everything. Industry was favorable. The volume taxes were favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune, within that $160 million that's shown on the slide, of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years as well as series mix and options. 
And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution cost and structural cost. And even though it's not shown on the slide, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually, Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team, really delivering across all aspects of the business in Europe, and you can see the results of that."

And actually our high-series models and sports derivatives accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. So things like Titanium, Vignale, ST versions of Focus and Fiesta, and even Mustang, which if you caught this in March, Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, beating folks like Porsche 911. So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround, we've used it as a blue print for Europe, and it's paying off."

This is a region also that has many, many challenges externally, geopolitical issues, weak currencies. A number of the markets are major all producers, and so they're suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment, the team basically held on wholesales. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange. As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share, and that was in a declining industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran out, which actually is growing and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. 
In that environment, we did move into a small loss of $14 million, and that was largely driven by weakness of the South African rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency. 
All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. We had another strong quarter driven by new products. For the wholesales, up 9%; revenue, up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. And here, we also grew share in a region that also was growing. The AP SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China. So strong performance there. It was really driven by the new products that we had introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the share. But we saw share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia, so a lot of good things going on in terms of market performance across the region. 
Our operating margin was over 8%, and the pretax results at $220 million. 
On the lower right of this slide, Slide 20, I'm on, I don't think I mentioned that. You can see the very strong performance we have from our China JVs that came at $443 million, that was up sharply, over 20%, and they generated a margin of 16.4%. 
The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region, India, ASEAN and Australia. So that was very encouraging. 
Let's go to the next slide. And this is how we got here. It was largely around volume. So industry share and then the favorable mix that I had mentioned earlier, and this was, again, driven by the new products. Edge was one of the big factors, but we saw good news from the Ranger, we saw good news from Mondeo and a number of other products. So again, a broad-based contribution there."

Let's move on to another part of the business we absolutely love, that's Ford Credit. I should mention that today at 11:00 and the details are in the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. And you'll be able to get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that as an extra slides and data here to support this call. So let's go through it. 
On Slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S, and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect in the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pretax results, over $500 million, as I mentioned, and up. 
And if we look at some of the metrics around U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO store. If you look at the delinquencies, over 60 days, they were only up 1 basis point; loss receivables, up 11 basis points. And those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance. So very healthy. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year at $31 million that was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of referred to the base residual performance at Let's Chat in March. And that was driven by a couple of factors. One, we had the losses on units that came in during the quarter, and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of a cumulative supplemental depreciation. And that's very much in line with what I said in the Let's Chat about that metric coming in bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million. 
If you look at the credit loss, that was also impacted. There were 2 things here. Charge-offs increased related to severities. And then we also had increases to the reserves expectations again of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger. 
Let's go to the next slide, and this is an added slide, giving you some additional metrics around some areas that I know are of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at lease performance, the industry has been -- we've been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was at 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case in the first quarter, we came at 26%. Our expectations are that, for the full year, we'll come in at a level that will be below that. And again, we're continuing to follow a proprietary modeling that we do of lease, making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk, whether it's geographical, product series and so forth. And so we're very comfortable to the level of leasing, but that number will come down for the full year. 
On the bottom, just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values at first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24-month and 36-months auction values versus a year ago. We are up sequentially from the first -- from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred. And that is largely based on supply. 
We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have about 200,000 units coming back this year. Demand for us, anyway, is still very healthy and about where it has been. We just have more units coming back. So we have assumed, going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values, and that's built into our guidance. 
If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experience. Of course, this has been, again, an industry trend of longer-term placement terms for us. At least over the last number of quarters, we're sort of around that 64-month level. We do have -- we are participating in terms that exceed that, and you can see that on the line. About 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at. 
And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see, we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last 5 years, and we generally see that happen a lot, that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit than to other alternative financing. 
If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. So a very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit. 
All right. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at cash, and this is Slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is it just underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see the $3.3 billion of Automotive pretax profit, over 80% of that flew right through the cash flow. So a very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some paydown of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year, and then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned. In addition, in the quarter, we completed to the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. 
And then with very strong liquidity and unnoted debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange and some noncash debt changes. 
Okay. And with that, I'm going to turn you over to Mark Fields."

So Slide 26 summarizes our industry and our GDP planning assumptions going forward. And again, all in all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the automotive industry sales globally and for the major markets that you see on the slide here.

I won't go through Slides 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance. We're through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and we'll continue to focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record. 
So just kind of bringing it all together on Slide 29. The first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company, with very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further. And again, focusing on those 4 key areas that drive creating value in the company: growth, returns, risk and rewards. 
Importantly, we're building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company, and also, taking advantage of emerging opportunities to Ford Smart Mobility. And importantly, as we grow, we're committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. 
So I guess, the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year, with sustained, strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our focus on innovation in all areas of our business and driving improved mix -- they're driving improved mix, a strong business structure and, of course, exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with record performance. 
So we're proud of our achievements, with the full understanding that we have to continually earn them. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risks across the entire company. 
So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions."

I think one would have expected that given the newness of the portfolio, pricing would be still up as it was in previous quarters.

So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million. And that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual aside, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter, in terms of a run rate, is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing us. Because last year, we largely did have -- while we had the new product, we have very low levels of incentives because of how tight the inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume, coming back to more normal levels. But still, better than our key competitors. So I think that's largely what's at play. We are seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKX. Although again, Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're actually seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter. In terms of the contribution cost. Again, I think it's the same factor. We don't -- we didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related costs, new product cost. Because we had F-Series largely in the quarter last year, not a lot of volume, but it was there. Edge was there. So as a result, all you can see is the great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of material efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on, down in that warranty freight, and other line, that was freight. We have a lot of premium freight in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches. And so that's coming through. One thing maybe I'll take it -- the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank, that we didn't think we'd see as much benefit on commodities this year, that clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline commodities, I think. Last year, we did have, I think it was $930 million, the good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we're tracking to something like that. I still think we'll have a little more bad news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the 2 are still going to be a bit more good news than what we had expected."

What we're really seeing in the second half is primarily around 2 other factors. One is normal seasonality. You've got both here and in Europe, and I think in Europe, you have more summer shutdown weeks. You also have the shutdowns that occurred at the end of the year. So it's just normal to have less production and therefore, less wholesales in the second half than the first half. It was a bit different last year because of the launches, but this is going to be a more normal year. Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that'll take place in the third quarter. While we'll be able to contain that in terms of the down weeks within the normal scheduled summer downtime, you still have the launch curve, which is going to take some volume out, which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty stock today because we have to anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get through that whole launch. And so that's a key factor. In terms of tweaking production for inventory, that's just going to be the normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand and inventory, and we'll adjust as we go forward. But it's really those first 2 factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. So it's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe, too."

We incur engineering that we absorb and are reflected in the results for the region that we don't recover from the JVs until we actually start producing the vehicles years later. We're launching Lincoln. We've got other allocated costs that sort of sit at the regional level that you wouldn't see there. So China, very profitable for us and improving year-over-year. But I think you'll kind of see very strong performance from the JVs over the course of the year.

But if that's even, order of magnitude, correct, what does that mean for the potential for a super cycle of unprecedented replacement of vehicles in the park now that might become obsolete a little faster than in the past? Where do you come out on this with your team? Is this good for SAAR, as there's this urgency to replace and that buying a car is a life-saving decision? Or does it get stunted by the fact that you have maybe trillions of dollars of used cars out there that -- where the equity is kind of stranded and creates a credit problem as people is trapped in that equity -- that negative equity?"

So there's a lot of kind of aspects to that question. I do think -- I do agree. We've said that we are going to see -- we're in an inflection point as an industry over the next number of years, given the technology that's available, not only to -- in the products itself, but how to serve the customer. So when you look at the -- your comment around, is there going to be a super cycle? Listen, I mean, there's hundreds of millions of cars, over 100 million cars here or 100 -- I can't remember exactly the numbers. There's a lot of cars here in the U.S. It's going to take a long time, even with breakthrough technologies, where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time. And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous or semiautonomous or all the connected cars, will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? I mean, from our standpoint, we're looking at this as, first off, it's too early to tell. But we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that, in urban areas, there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales. But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24/7, they'll rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue and, ultimately, more car sales. So I think it's still too early to tell, but our strategy, very clearly, is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams."

Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one o",657,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. 
And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of our best second quarters ever. And while pretax profits are down compared with last year's record second quarter, revenue was up 6%. So we grew the top line. Global market share declined outside of North America, but share was up in the U.S. and Canada. 
Our Automotive operating cash flow was an all-time quarterly record. Ereps pretax profit almost tripled from last year at North America and Ford Credit remained strong. Now combined with our first quarter record, we achieved record first-half pretax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America. Now we continue to expect another strong year, and we're committed to our full year guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year. But at the same time, we now see a number of risks that the entire Ford team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance. And we'll explain more as we go through the information this morning.
Now turning to Slide 4. We remain absolutely focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value, and I'm pleased to say me make progress on each. As I mentioned, we grew our top line and we announced actions to continue to grow our core business, including new global SUVs and also positive sales momentum at Lincoln. 
We also continue to pursue emerging opportunities, such as our investment in Pivotal, which will further strengthen our cloud-based software capabilities. Our returns were strong, as I just reviewed. Now in terms of risk, we received a rating upgrade by Fitch. Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter. And we achieved $1.6 billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan.
And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million to our shareholders. Now Slide 5 shows some of the other highlights in the quarter. And I won't go through each of these. But as you can see, they span everything from awards for new products and engines to progress in our quality efforts to launches of products and connected services. But I will just point out in quality, the J.D. Power IQS survey, Lincoln came in at #7 and Ford came in at #11, both improved and really explanation point on the efforts that our team has around continuously improving our quality for our customers. Now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and how we see it on Slide 6.
At the macro level, we're seeing higher levels of economic uncertainty. Financial markets in the sterling and euro are affected by Brexit, and global interest rates have been referring to recent lows. Now U.S. growth is improving after a weak start that we saw at the beginning of the year, but we are seeing signs of a maturing U.S. recovery. We do expect continued growth in China, albeit that supported by government stimulus measures. But we're also seeing increased pressures on margins. And while conditions in Brazil remain difficult, Russia is actually showing some signs of stabilization. 
Now for Ford specifically, our risk are around lower pricing and higher incentives than we expected in the U.S. and China. Our softer, although still strong, U.S. retail industry and the effects of Brexit on our operations in Europe, a more difficult external environment across many of our markets in Middle East and Africa, a weaker Chinese R&D and lower-than-expected auction values for smaller vehicles leased in the U.S. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back at the end and cover our outlook. Bob?"

We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter. And then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is",1484,"Okay. Thank you, Mark. We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter. And then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is the third column. 
So as Mark said, it was a strong quarter for us. And to demonstrate that, if we look at the company adjusted pretax results, you can see $3 million [ph] , which was down 9% from the year ago, but it was, as Mark said, one of the strongest second quarter that we have. If you go now further to net incomes attributable to Ford at $2 billion, that was also down 9% and adjusted earnings per share down 4%. 
If you go the bottom of the chart, you can see the liquidity metrics. I'll come back to those later so I won't go through them individually at this point, but you can see they were very, very strong. If you look at the year-to-date column, let's sit the same lines on the chart. Our company's adjusted pretax result of $6.8 million. Remember, we had the best ever first quarter. So when we combine that with the strong second quarter, we ended up with a record for the first half $6.8 million, that was up 35%. And net income of $4.4 billion, that was up 33%. And then the adjusted earnings per share for the first half of $1.20, up 45%.
Let's go onto the next slide, Slide 9, and share what I want to focus on are the absolutes before we get into some of the details within both the Automotive segment and Ford Credit. Looking at the Automotive segment, you can see the strong results in North America at $2.7 billion. It was down about 5%. Europe was clearly a highlight among all the business units in the quarter. It was up 3x from where we were last year, the best second quarter result ever. And that included some impact from Brexit, which I'll talk about in just a minute. But really, a great result in Europe. 
And if you look at the financial services, that includes a $400 million profit from Ford Credit. It was down, and I'll explain what was behind that. If you look at the other business units, they were all in losses. South America, 2 65, down a bit. Middle East and Africa, down also at $65 million loss. And then we had our first loss in Asia Pacific in 13 quarters at $8 million. And that decline was driven largely by China. We'll talk about that later in the presentation as well. I will highlight here all other, that's one of our new segments, that is primarily in this quarter, net interest expense.
Okay, let's go on to Slide 10. And as usual, we'll look at the key metrics for the Automotive sector. Very strong absolutes across the board. But when you look at the comparisons versus last year, some mixed results. Wholesale is flat. Revenue, up 5%. Market share, Mark explained that, it was down everywhere, but in North America. And the operating margin was a strong 7.7% and the result of 2.8 . And then if you look at the very bottom of the page, we provided you with the same metrics and on the year-over-year changes for the first half. And you can see very strong performance right across the board with exceptionally market share, where we were down just a touch. 
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 11. And we'll start breaking the Automotive segment down. This is a view of what happened on a year-over-year basis that resulted in a decline of $130 million. So when you look at it overall, you can see that the market factors, which is volume mix and net pricing, was down. And that was driven by a higher incentives, and that was mainly in the U.S. We will talk about that when we get to the North American slides. You can see exchange was an issue, $269 million. We did have some favorable cost performance and that was largely driven by a commodities. And then another to the far right that was largely the gain on sale of an equity investment, I'll touch on a bit when we get to North America.
Okay. Let's go into North America on Slide 12 and look at the key metrics. Again, very strong quarter for North America. The top line was essentially flat to very slightly up in the case of revenue. Market share flop. But as was already mentioned, within that, the U.S. was up, and that was higher fleet performance. But also, we had very strong retail share improvement for F series. Canada was up, Mexico was down. That's how we ended up with a sort of flat within a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at margin, 11.3%. That was down 9/10 of a 1%. But obviously, as over 11%, that's an outstanding level of efficiency in performance for the North American operations and then $2.7 billion. If you look at the bottom of the slide, really strong results in the first half, best ever for North America. We had very strong growth. We grew the share 12.1% margin and $5.8 billion in profit, up 31%. So really strong performance in the first half for North America.
All right. Let's go to the next slide and look at what happened in the quarter. I mean, year-over-year basis, here, the story is largely around incentives. If you look at the market factors, you can see that they were down on a net basis, driven by the incentives. And essentially, what we're seeing is over time, and particularly as the U.S. industry started to plateau and we're starting to get to a more mature part of the economic cycle in the U.S, we've seen sort of a very gradual rising, very modestly rising level of incentives for the industry, and we have been increasing along with that. Now what do you also have happening on a year-over-year basis, which is maybe a little bit unique to us, is the fact that a year ago, we had very low incentives for the F-150. 
Because remember, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City. I think it was around May when we got to full production. So we had very tight incentives, very high ATPs on F-150. We've become more normal, if you will. We're still in a good position relative to our peer set within the particularly our domestic peers in terms of ATPs for F-150, as well as incentives. But there was a factor of that as well. But there's no question that we've seen an increase, and that is more than what we had expected when we developed our plan at the beginning of the year. 
When you look at cost. We were favorable on cost overall. That was again driven by incentives. Most of the good news are rather commodities. Most of the good news on commodities and company occurred in North America. 
And then to the far right, you can see the good news from that equity sale, which was the OE connection sale that occurred in the quarter, and that benefited North America. 
Before we leave this slide, I just want to go back to mix. Mix is a very important part of the story across many of the business units. But certainly, North America was one of the strongest stories. That's products mix. In the case of North America, when I get to Europe, you're going to see the same thing along with good news on series mix and options. A very important part of what's happening. And so we're seeing sort of the car recession. But this is actually been part of our strategy, to focus on higher-margin, more profitable vehicles, but also where the consumers are going. 
The other thing I would just note on the slide is that we have picked up in warranty cost. You can see that in the callout box, that had a recall. That was about $100 million. And I just want to -- digress for just for a moment to say our approach inside Ford is unfortunately recalls are a normal part of our business. So we do not put recalls and special items or exclude them from margins or exclude them from operating results, as some of our other competitors do. It is, again, unfortunately, normal part of business. We will report them in operating results. We always have. We always will. And if there's something of consequence that occurs, we'll just call it out and you can make your own judgment in terms of whether that's a run rate or not. Certainly, they're lumpy."

Obviously, as Bob mentioned, is it still remains a fairly healthy levels overall. The competitive environment has increased as growth has slowed and the retail industry demand has weakened, as we saw in the second quarter. And this has resulted in higher industry incentives with, if you look at the retail industry sales rate, it's actually declined 3 out of the last 4 months. So the bottom line is that we've seen a tougher pricing environment this quarter, and we will face one going forward. And as Bob mentioned with the car segment, the most impacted as various competitors look to protect their share."

Let's move on to Slide 14, and we'll talk about South America. In South America, this is a story that is very much what it's been the last number of quarters. External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a d",694,"Okay. Let's move on to Slide 14, and we'll talk about South America. In South America, this is a story that is very much what it's been the last number of quarters. External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a decline in the top line. You can see double digits. In the case of revenue, you can see it was down 17%. That decline is entirely due to the weaker currencies. 
Market share was down as we focused on the most profitable parts of our portfolio amid increasing discounts across the industry. And then you can see the results in terms of margin and pretax results. This is largely what you're also seeing in the first half. I will say that the team has done a -- continues to do a good job of focusing on the things that it can manage, particularly on cost. 
And if you go to the next slide, on Slide 15, you can see the results of that. We once again delivered very strong cost performance. So if you think about last year, we delivered over $400 million, we have good news in cost performance, we had good news in the first quarter, another good tranche of performance here in the second quarter. But as you can see, just to the left of that, we continue to see difficulties in pricing enough to be able to offset the effects of high local inflation and the weaker local currencies. 
Industry still an issue, as you can see in the volume and mix. And then the balance sheet actually helped us this time. This was the strengthening of the Argentinian peso. We are seeing good things in Argentina. Then new government is really getting traction terms of turning that economy in the better direction. And so that gave us some good news in the quarter.
Okay. Let's go on to Europe, which, as I mentioned earlier, was a bright spot for us. If you look at the wholesales and revenue up double digits. Share actually declined a little bit. That was market mix in Southern European markets grew a little disproportionally. Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe, and so that affected us. 
Margin was 5.8%, which is very, very good performance and the profit that I touched on earlier. And then if you look at the first half. We made $900 million in the quarter, a margin of 6%. And you can see very strong growth at the top line as well and share was flat. So this was a really great story. 
The other thing I want to highlight, we were -- we're committed to Russia. We stayed in Russia. We've been working to make sure that we're responding to the environment in Russia. And it's paying off. Within the good news that we saw in the quarter, Russia was actually a good part of that. And on that note, let's turn to the year-over-year on Slide 17.
And you can see the improvement of $300 million. It was market performance. It was a favorable cost performance. And then in the case of exchange, this is the first time that you'll see us talking about Brexit. We had bad news of about $60 million on the balance sheet related to the weak sterling. And one of the things that's important to note is that our strategy on hedging for the company is to go into a year with certain of our key currencies completely hedged from an operational exposure point of view. So we came into the year with a sterling and the euro completely hedge. So we don't see any shares relative to the weakness of the Sterling on an operating basis for the balance of the year. We have about 60% of next year's exposure already covered, and there's a little bit that's also covered all the way out in 2018. When we talk about Brexit effect later, you have to remember the $60 million because there is an impact in the second half that we'll talk about that's related to weaker industry."

And that include, as you can imagine, looking at consumer confidence levels amongst other indicators. And if you reflect the industry back in the first quarter in the U.K, was it a record. But we saw that growth decline in the second quarter ahead of the Brexit. And so far, as we look at July, by our reckoning, the industry is actually up in the U.K. But on a retail basis, it's down. So as we look going forward, the industry could be down 5% to 10% for the rest of the year depending upon which outside forecast you'll look at. But even within of that, we'll continue to work to deliver consistent market performance, including obviously continuing our strong growth in commercial vehicles."

I",957,"Yes, this is probably the best place to talk about the ongoing effect of Brexit. So we've all talked about second half a little bit later in the presentation. But we are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit. It's a $60 million with another $140 million, $150 million related to a weaker U.K. industry. When you get into '17 and '18, we see the impact on Ford being somewhat in the range of $400 million to $500 million in each year. And that is related again to weak industry or weaker industry in the U.K. And then also you start to pick up a bit of bad news on exchange because of the fact that the hedging is only 60% in place for next year and less than that in 2018. So that's what we're looking at. We're not going beyond that in terms of what happens once they actually leaves because this just too much uncertainty particularly around what will happen with tariff barriers.
Okay. All right. Let's go on and we'll talk about the Middle East and Africa on Slide 18. I mean, this is the story of just a bad business environment. If anything can go roll, it seems like it has. It's low oil. It's weak currencies. There's political trifles. In South Africa, we've seen labor disruptions. I mean, it's just, you name it, it's happening. And the results has been really big industries. I mean, we're seeing because of 30%, 40% in some of our markets. Some of the countries access to currency and so forth, it's pretty difficult. But you can see the fact of that is only been a modest increase in the loss. The team's actual done a great job of working of the cost it can control because it does import most of the vehicles that it sells from other business units. But they've actually done a great job of cause and if done a good job on pricing. 
And if you look at the market share, while it looks like it's down and in fact, it is, that is driven by the growth of the Iranian industry, which we don't participate in. The overall region is down 300,000 units. Within that, Iran is up 300. So if we take Iran out, the team is actually increased our share by 6/10 of a point. So they're really doing a great job on share, on cost. But the headwinds across the region are just so large that we're kind of swimming in place at the moment.
Okay. Let's go on to Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is an interesting story. We saw a decline in wholesales. Some of that was expected because we did have a planned 8-week shutdown of our ChangChing #1 assembly plant, that was for the complete overhaul of the paint boost there. So that was expected. But frankly, there were performance issues at Ford as well. There were also issues in terms of industry segmentation that we'll touch on. 
If you look at revenue, revenue was up 17%. We did see a decline in market share that was China. And if you look at the margins, obviously, we were just below breakeven in margins and pretax results. And as I mentioned earlier, the first loss we've had in quite a number of quarters. And if you look at the year-to-date results, we've seen the top line growth share as well. But again, our operating margin and pretax results down from a year ago. 
I wouldn't highlight in the far right of the slide, our China joint ventures on an equity after-tax basis contributed about $300 million of profit. That was down about 28%. We still have very healthy margins there at 16.1%. I think that was down about 1.2 points from where we were this time a year ago. 
What we have on Slide 20 is a bit of what happened in terms of market share in China in the period, which really drove what happened in the region. So if you look at the far left, last year, we did 5.3%. China were down about 9/10 of a point. And you can see the factors that drove that. Half of it was basically external. 
Industry mix, what that means is the mix of the industry stronger on passenger vehicles, it was weaker on commercial vehicles. We have joint ventures that participate, 2 different ones that participate in each one of those. The segmentation issue is that within commercial vehicles, it was down, but it was actually up in the very low margin many commercial segment, which we don't participate in. So if you think about where we participate in, it was even lower. And so that was the effect that it had on our share from both those -- the industry mix change and then the segmentation within commercial vehicles. 
And then on performance, we were off 4/10 of a point. That was largely around weakness in the C-segment and the small utilities, where we're seeing a lot of competition from the domestics that are really coming up strongly and with really better products. And so it was a difficult situation for us. 
We also had some go-to-market strategies, frankly. And the team immediately saw these issues there. They're actually started to occur in March. Immediate action was taken to address these issues. then you can see, looking at the share in April, May and June, we started to get back on track. And we feel like the second half of the year is going to be better for us and supported in part by a number of new product launches that are important that will help us."

So our mix of more profitable vehicles, such as medium and large cars and SUVs and premium cars, now account for about 40% of our sales in China. And that's up 5 points versus last year. So as Bob mentioned, we've taken actions to improve our market performance. And we have a number of important launches. The Taurus with the 1.5-liter engine. It will be the only large car eligible for the purchase tax incentive. The new cougar, the new rodeo with the MKZ in Continental. And the majority of these watches will benefit us in the fourth quarter, not so much the third quarter."

Let's go to Slide 21 and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I then explain what you can see. I'm going to explain to what we had expected because that's what we just talked about. So you can see market factors were slightly negative, both pricing and then you can see volume mix pretty flat. Within that, there actually was quite good news on mix. So with that mix and other, it was more like around $60 million, $70 million of favorable mix, and that's along the lines of what Mark talkies about. 
When you look at the cost performance, it was up. We expected it to be up. It actually isn't up as much as we had expected. And then exchange, this is a story of a weaker renminbi. As Brexit has occurred and it affected the sterling and the euro, the Chinese are now kind of targeting their currency against of the basket of currencies, not just the dollar. As those weakened, we saw the Chinese start to push down the renminbi and the response to that, and that had an effect on us. 
What we had expected to see before, we didn't expect the loss obviously, was the fact that we had stronger market factors. And that pricing in China has been worse than what we thought. We thought 5% to 6%. Actually, year-to-date, it's approaching 7% or high 6s. We're at about 7% or so. We think this will mitigate in the balance of the year because if you look at last year, the decline was largely sort of from this point through the rest of the year. So we think it will mitigate and we'll end up at the high end of that range. And when you look at the volume and mix, that was this year, which we talked about. So it seems all over. We're working on it. But that's really what happened to us in Asia Pacific in the quarter. Let's go on to slide 22 and we'll turn to Ford Credit.
Ford Credit grew. That's the first 2 metrics, double digits, and that was really around the world. If you look at the pretax results, the $400 million, that was down 21%, I'll show you why in just a minute. If you look at sort of the portfolio performance, very healthy FICO scores and a good place delinquencies up a bit. Although I'll say something about that just a minute in terms of credit losses. And the loss receivables, up 15 basis points. Actually about where it's been the last 2 or 3 quarters. It's just up a bit from the last 2 or 3, up more from a year ago. And starting to approach what the level of OCR that we saw before the Great Recession. So this is just getting back sort of normal levels. It's not an issue per se. 
All right. Let's go on to the next slide and look at the year-over-year. So the decline was largely around lease residuals and credit losses. In terms of lease residuals, it's really 2 things. In the callout box, if you look at the residual gains and losses, you can see on a year-over-year basis the declines. So these are vehicles that come back. Do we lose money or do we gain money? We actually gain money on the return vehicles and the quarterly just we didn't get as much as we did it go. So that's how we'd end up with a negative minor. In terms of supplementals depreciation. This is a reflection of lower auction values and a projection of lower lease-in values, particularly for smaller vehicles. We have adjusted our depreciation glide path to those new lower end points, and that's what's reflected there. 
When you look at the credit losses. This is largely around a couple of things. You can see the charge-offs. Those are the vehicles that we actually repossess and then we took back to market and resold. And you can see that there was a decline in there of $34 million and then we had to increase the reserve by $31 million. 
But the thing I wanted to mention on this is a number of things going on in here. But while the delinquencies are up a little bit, what we're seeing happened is that the number of people who actually default once they are delinquent, if you will, is increasing versus where it has been. It's not a level that's of concern. It's actually just coming back again to a level that's more normal, I think a number of articles from banks and others around that. But that's one of the factor. The other thing is that the severity. So when we do take them back to the auction market, the severities are greater in part because of what they mentioned in terms of the lease-in values of the vehicles are lower overall. But also because of the longer terms. People are -- the portfolio of people are turning the vehicles a bit earlier, and so the severities are greater. Because all of those factors, we also have had to increase the reserve in addition to the fact that this is just bigger. And so we have to increase every serving line with just the larger business. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide. And this is looking at trends. I'm just going to talk to the 2 on the right. I think I already covered the 2 on the left, the 2 the right I've covered. We said in the first quarter that our lease penetration would decline. It did by 3 points in the second quarter. We think again for the full year, it will be lower than it was in the first quarter. 
And you can see that we dropped a bit more than what the overall industry did. And then the lower left, this is around what we talked about, the auction values. This is a constant mix. So it's mix the same as the second quarter. You can see that we are pretty flat in terms of values in the second quarter compared to the first, but down from where we were a year ago. And that's largely around the smaller vehicles. 
Okay. Let's turn now to cash flow. Cash flow, a very, very good story for us in the quarter. It was the best ever in the quarter and a half, $4.2 billion operating in the quarter, $6.9 billion the half. It was driven by the profit, but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we have favorable timing differences. When we look at the full year, we do expect that the $6.9 billion will come down. So what we achieved in the first half will come down because we do see negative cash flow in the second quarter, largely driven by the third quarter. And we'll come back to that in just a minute. But we think largely disses around the effect of working capital on the favorable timing differences will reverse when the time we get to the end of the year.
I will note on this slide before taking our capital spending projection down. The guidance have been $7.7 billion. We're taking that down to $7 billion. It's largely around efficiencies on programs that are coming to a conclusion. And we're seeing we delivered them more efficiently also, lower noncredit spending.
Okay. Let's go to the balance sheet summary. This is a new slide we've developed just to capture all the balance sheet metrics. The other thing I'll say year is the Automotive balance sheet, very, very strong. Ford Credit continues to be well-capitalized and strong as well. And then, finally, in terms of pensions, we're still on track to have the pensions largely funded and derisked by the end of the year.
Okay. Now let's switch gears and let's talked more now about what lies ahead, not only in the second half, but for the full year. And we'll touch very briefly on 2017 and of course, talk more about that at Investor Day in the middle of September. 
So what this slide basically says is compared with our prior expectations, our prior guidance, when you look at GDP, we now expect global U.S. and Europe GDP to be somewhat softer than what we had expected. Brazil and China, pretty much in line with what we've expected since the beginning of the year. When we look at industry volume, we do think the global industry volume is slightly be a bit higher than what we had expected. That is driven by primarily China, but also Europe is doing a bit better than we had expected at the high end of the range that we guided to earlier in the year. The softness is in the U.S. that is largely on the retail side of the business and also in Brazil.
Now let's go on to a 2 special attention slides that we provided to help you understand the second half and also our view of the full year. So the first thing I wanted to highlight is when you look at the far left, that's the $6.8 billion company profit in the first half, record results, fantastic. What is in there, though, is important to understand. A lot of the issues and risks that we will talk about for the full year, they were there in the first half. They started to appear in the first quarter and then the second quarter unfolded. 
We offset those risks with $1.6 billion of favorable cost performance versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So it wasn't an easy quarter or an easy half. We have to work to get there. But the important message of this is that those risks flow into the second half. So for us to deliver the guidance that we're committed to deliver for the full year, we have to do that all over again. We're going to have to deliver stronger actions on costs. We're going to have to go back and look at the top line as well and find every dollar of revenue that we can get. That's what that next bar represents, the profit improvement actions. 
So we do that and we're committed to do that, and we are able to deliver the guidance, which again, we're committed to do. And that's what the right hand bar reflects. What we're highlighting in between there with the red bars are the factors that are going to drive to a lower second half than as normal. Second half is normally lower. That's what the first red bar represents. But there's some other actions in there that I want go through individually other than I'll touch on Super Duty that will give us a lower second half than what would be normal. 
Super Duty is a very, very important product. It's high-volume. It's very high margin. It's a big change over because we have not had a complete redesign of this product for 19, 20 years. It's going into a big plan. It's aluminum. It's a new frame. Its powertrain upgrade. It's new features. It's new technologies. So we haven't really -- a lot of its product for 19 years. So when we make this change, obviously, it's going to have an impact in the quarter from the launch effect and so forth, the cost. But even as we go through the quarter, we expect to have some impact because we do think we'll have lower contribution margins coming out this of than what we had going in. 
Still very high contribution margins, among the best in the portfolio. But the new product, which will be far superior than what we have today and certainly, positioned the product to be a winner and the leader over the next decade and need the regulatory requirements that we have to meet, there will be little contrition margins when we come out of the launch. And that will flow through into the fourth quarter and the forward years. Now what will happen over time is we'll start to get the cost reductions, which we normally get, which is what benefit the older F-Series over the course of that 19 years cycle.
But it will also drive a weaker-than-normal third quarter along with some of these other factors. So to put that into context, usually, the third quarter is about 1/4 of our full year results. It's likely half of that or lower. And that's largely around the F-Series effect. 
So let's go to the next slide. Some of those risk that we talked about that were in the first quarter largely or first half and that flow through into the year shown here. It's around higher Ford industry incentives. We've talked about that. They're up. We're up in line with that. The weakness or the softness in the U.S. regional industry was either second half actually been softer than the first half on an absolute basis. Again, that is -- it's retail. These are absolutely strong levels. They're just not as strong as what we had expected. And in fact, looking into '17, we think that we'll see further softness as the cycle matures. 
If you go down the page, Middle East and Africa, I've already talked about it. That's going to continue the situating that we're facing. We're responding to that. In Asia Pacific, the higher -- the lower net pricing, the weaker exchange. We saw that. we're still dealing with it. And in Ford Credit, we have addressed the this auction values, but it will give us a lower second half in line with what we saw in the first half when we earned over $900 million.
The opportunities is Europe. We made a lot of money in Europe in the first half. Currently have opportunity what we -- versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but we have to deal with Brexit, and we talked about that already. So we see these risk. We have seen them at the beginning of the approval been dealing with them very successfully. We will do so in the second half. But that is work that is still ahead of us. And Mark, we'll talk to that and his comments, which I'll turn over to him now."

But as you mentioned, we're facing risk to achieving that. Now I'd like to talk about what we're going to do about it. And if you go to Slide 31, it shows you the improvement actions that we already have underway in the company. 
So to start, as we match production to demand and be very consistent around that, that will help reduce manufacturing costs. We've implemented an aggressive company-wide attack plan on costs. And as Bob mentioned, it builds on the considerable cost progress that we achieved in the first half of the year with that $1.6 billion in cost improvements that we delivered versus our plan. And as you can imagine, it looks At everything, from material cost to marketing and selling efficiencies, to freight and admin reductions. Now at the same time, we have to put special attention on our go-to-market plans in the U.S. and China to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities. In addition, we are also utilizing already expanded data and analytics team to really pinpoint immediate areas of improvement in our market factors including better volume and mix and pricing, which will in turn drive revenue.
And then, finally, we have a number of significant vehicle launches around the world this year. And we are challenging our team to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities as we launch those vehicles and take advantage of those launches. 
So we're aggressively executing on all these actions. And of course, we'll will provide an update on our progress during our Investor Day on September 14. 
So in summary, and turning to Slide 32. Again, I'd like to put the quarter in context for you. We had a strong second quarter. We had record cash flow and we had a record start to this year. And at the same time, we're seeing more pressure throughout the business for the remainder of the year. Now some of it, as we discussed, is expected, such as the launch of the Super Duty in North America. And some of it is not expected, such as the higher Ford industry incentives in North America, a softening of the U.S. retail industry and uncertainty in Europe due to the Brexit effects.
So as a result, we're calling the second half of this year and particularly the third quarter to be much weaker than normal. Now I just want to caution you against using the second half of the year as an indicative run rate for 2017. It isn't. We expect 2017 to be another solid year for Ford despite the likely absence of growth in the U.S. industry volume and Brexit effects in Europe.
Now I think you know us very well. The Ford team remains committed to delivering our plan for this year, but we also have a long track record of calling risk as soon as we see them and acting decisively to deal with them. And that's exactly what we're doing today. So with that, we'd love to take your questions."

Bob will take the first one on the industry sales. Here's how I think we characterize the market. If you recall the -- vehicle sales for the industry grew at a really good pace in the early stages of the economic recovery. And if you call, it actually outpaced the overall economic growth at the time. And so while the industry remains at fairly healthy levels, the competitive environment has intensified in that growth has motivated to ONE Ford moderated. And as we've seen some of the softness in the retail demand. And then that environments, you seen, as we've said, incentives creep up, and we've been about in line with that. But also, I think what it will result in probably for the remainder of this year, Brian, is a fairly volatile kind of sore factor from month-to-month because that will be influenced by any particular OEM or brand that wants to increase their incentives to maybe use their market share or whatever. As we get in -- so the bottom line is we expect in the second half of this year that the retail industry to be lower than the year ago. As we get into 2017, obviously, we'll talk more about that in the future. But as Bob mentioned, we do expect the industry to be probably slightly down in 2017."

I go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also, the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at the higher levels of inventory as we were particularly in the early part of the year because of 2 factors. One, we had to prepare for the Super Duty launch, which we touched on. And also, because of the fact that many of our plans are running at 3 crew. And so as a result, there will be periods where it's low absolute volume months for the industry inventory will be but it's to support the higher volume months of the year particularly in the spring in the end of the year into the summer and so forth. So we're comfortable with the levels of that we've been at. The things that's kind of interesting in terms of responding to the softness, it's not been around incentives, it's been making production adjustments. Because if you look in the first half at -- I mean, you would see this, but I'm telling you this, if you look at the wholesale that we had planned, they are higher or were higher than what we actually delivered. Because even as we saw some of the softness that we've talked about the curve in the first half of the year, and his team are making production adjustments along the way. So we ended up with lower wholesales in the half than what we had expected. I mean, that's how we primarily deal with that. It's just adjusting production to demand, and this is what we'll in the second half, which is what Mark talked about in his comments. So the incentives, I think, are different. The incentives are really sort of environmental issue, if you will, across the industry. And then for us, I think there's a piece of what I talked about earlier around the normalization in this period versus 1 year ago with F-150."

So they tend on the U.S. environment it's a little bit tougher, maybe slightly down. But the guidance in the back half in North America implies something about 6.5% as we mentioned sort of pricing and incentive a little bit. So I guess, given sort of what you're seeing from an industry perspective in just a little bit of a tougher environment, does that give you any pause for your breakeven analysis longer term?

There's no question about that because the second half will be lower. They usually are lower in the second half. This will be a weaken than normal second half. So that is what it's going to happen. I will just go back to '14. If you think about '14, North America had lower margins than it had been running at because of the launch of F-150, and then they bounced back up in 2015, particularly the second half and then early this year. So what we're seeing is a really big launch. It's not going to take much as volume out as those launches did because we've learned so much from them. But it's a real bug launch, and it's going to have an effect. It's really around all these other issues and the softening of the industry and the higher incentives. Those are the things that we're working on. And I would actually call them sort of early signs of the maturation of the cycle. The structure that we put in place in North America was designed to give us good results and good performance when things get tough, and it is getting a little bit tougher. That's what we're seeing. But I think the structure of the business is good and by the way, remember that $1.6 billion of cost performance you talked about, a lot of that was delivered in North America. So we're keeping an up on the terms of the search of the business at a what we're seeing happens. So I think we good shape in terms of the robustness of the structure and prepared for that eventual downturn."

But to your question, Colin, what you will see overall, particularly in the second half, you'll see a bigger-than-normal cost increase. And that will also be something that will see for the full year. We had great performance on a year-over-year basis in the first half. Some of that is because it was a relatively quiet product period for us, if you will, overall globally. But when we get into the second half, we have Super Duty. We've got the continental. We have some of the launches in North America that will take place in China. But very importantly, and we'll talk more about this when we get to Investor Day, that was one of the bars on that waterfall chart, which was around product investments. We have been seeing an increase in product investment from Ford over the last number of years. They're actually as we got bigger, we saw in the portfolio, invested more technologies. We went into new markets we added capacity particularly in emerging markets. Going forward, we're going to be completely replacing the C platform. We're going to be completely replacing the C/D platform. We are investing heavily in electrification, Adam's point of on autos we close of that's underway, as we speak. There's regulatory requirements that we have to meet, which bring with it added investment as well. So you will see an increase in both capital spending and engineering. And you see some of that even in the second half relative to the first half. Because what we're showing you is increasing then higher-than-normal. Normally what we see that happen is even higher-than-normal. And as we go into next year, that will be a factor. So you will see higher cost overall in the year versus a year ago that will largely pick up in the second half of the year. But we don't expect to be down by the time we get into the end of the year.

And I really believe that ultimately, that will be the driver of decisions around how aggressively people go after a pilot isn't growing frankly, number. The other thing that's probably different than it's been over the last 2 or 3 years is the yen. The yen has started to shrink from the levels it had reached. I think it got to about 1 20 level.

So I think it's going to play out over the next number of months. But our view is that the industry is going to come down to a certain degree."

But first of all, we'll get out of some of the one-time unique issues that we saw in the second half and maybe to some extent, in the first half. But also see, I think it does appear in these articles that are written about it that the emerging market downturn perhaps globally is beginning to bottom out. I talked about the fact that where it's already improving in terms of our portfolio. There's a question earlier around South America. Our view, early view anyway is that that could be very, very, very small levels of growth there next year. Nothing to write home about. But it will be great to see a positive number with no brackets around it. And so that will be perhaps the beginning of the churn there and decline of the increased losses. So that's going to help. We're going to have, again, slowly still a lot of product launches. And I think going back to the earlier question around the portfolio, we really are focusing our investments very specifically to where we can make money. And I think that will be a phenomenon that will be even it, sharper Focus, going ahead, and I think that will benefit, for example, the new Ford SUVs that we talked about globally a mean those are the sweet spot of where our consumers are going this our high-margin products. That will start to help us as we move ahead. And the cost, and we're going to really -- we will see cost increases, called them that are healthy to support the growing business and certainly to be a leader in all these emerging opportunities ahead. But other than that, we are going to be, as we have been, very focused on efficiencies and driving nonessential costs out of the business. We did that very successfully in the first half.

Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of",661,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of our best second quarters ever. And while pretax profits are down compared with last year's record second quarter, revenue was up 6%, so we grew the top line. 
Global market share declined outside of North America, but share was up in the U.S. and Canada. Our Automotive operating cash flow was an all-time quarterly record. Europe's pretax profit almost tripled from last year. And North America and Ford Credit remained strong. Now combined with our first quarter record, we achieved record first half pretax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America.
Now we continue to expect another strong year, and we're committed to our full year guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year. But at the same time, we now see a number of risks that the entire Ford team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance. And we'll explain more as we go through the information this morning.
Now turning to Slide 4. We remain absolutely focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value, and I'm pleased to say we made progress on each. As I mentioned, we grew our top line, and we announced actions to continue to grow our core business, including new global SUVs and also positive sales momentum at Lincoln. We also continued to pursue emerging opportunities, such as our investment in Pivotal, which will further strengthen our cloud-based software capabilities. 
Our returns were strong, as I just reviewed. Now in terms of risk, we received a rating upgrade by Fitch. Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter. And we achieved $1.6 billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million to our shareholders.
Now Slide 5 shows some of the other highlights in the quarter, and I won't go through each of these. But as you can see, they span everything from awards for our new products and engines, to progress in our quality efforts, to the launches of products and connected services. But I will just point out in quality, the J.D. Power IQS survey, Lincoln came in at #7 and Ford came in at #11, both improved and really puts the explanation point on the efforts that our team has around continuously improving our quality for our customers.
Now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and how we see it on Slide 6. At the macro level, we're seeing higher levels of economic uncertainty. Financial markets and the sterling and euro are affected by Brexit. And global interest rates have been referring to recent lows. Now U.S. growth is improving after a weak start that we saw at the beginning of the year, but we are seeing signs of a maturing U.S. recovery. We do expect continued growth in China, albeit that's supported by government stimulus measures. But we're also seeing increased pressures on margins. And while conditions in Brazil remain difficult, Russia is actually showing some signs of stabilization. 
Now for Ford, specifically, our risks are around lower pricing and higher incentives than we expected in the U.S. and China; a softer, although still strong, U.S. retail industry; the effects of Brexit on our operations in Europe; a more difficult external environment across many of our markets in Middle East and Africa; a weaker Chinese RMB; and lower-than-expected auction values for smaller vehicles leased in the U.S. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back at the end and cover our outlook. Bob?"

We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is",1488,"Okay. Thank you, Mark. We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is the third column. 
So as Mark said, it was a strong quarter for us. And to demonstrate that, if we look at the company adjusted pretax results, you can see $3 billion, which was down 9% from the year ago. But it was, as Mark said, one of the strongest second quarters that we've had. If you go down further to net income attributable to Ford at $2 billion. That was also down 9% and adjusted earnings per share down 4%. 
If you go to the bottom of the chart, you can see the liquidity metrics. I'll come back to those later, so I won't go through them individually at this point, but you can see they were very, very strong. If you look at the year-to-date column, let's hit the same lines on the chart. Our company adjusted pretax results at $6.8 billion. Remember, we had the best ever first quarter. So when we combine that with the strong second quarter, we ended up with a record for the first half $6.8 billion, that was up 35%. And net income of $4.4 billion, that was up 33%. And then the adjusted earnings per share for the first half at $1.20, up 45%.
Let's go on to the next slide, Slide 9. And here, what I want to focus on are the absolutes before we get into some of the details within both the Automotive segment and Ford Credit. Looking at the Automotive segment, you can see the strong result at North America at $2.7 billion. It was down about 5%. Europe was clearly a highlight among all the business units in the quarter. It was up 3x from where we were last year, the best second quarter result ever. And that included some impact from Brexit, which I'll talk about in just a minute. But really, a great result in Europe. 
And if you look at the Financial Services, that includes a $400 million profit from Ford Credit. It was down, and I'll explain what was behind that. If you look at the other business units, they were all in losses. South America, $265 million, down a bit. Middle East and Africa, down also at a $65 million loss. And then we had our first loss in Asia Pacific in 13 quarters at $8 million, and that decline was driven largely by China, and we'll talk about that later in the presentation as well. I will highlight here All Other. That's one of our new segments. That is primarily, in this quarter, net interest expense.
Okay, let's go on to Slide 10. And as usual, we'll look at the key metrics for the Automotive sector. Very strong absolutes across the board, but when you look at the comparisons versus last year, some mixed results. Wholesale is flat. Revenue, up 5%. Market share, Mark explained that, it was down everywhere but in North America. And the operating margin was a strong 7.7% and the result at $2.8 billion. And then if you look at the very bottom of the page, we've provided you with the same metrics and the year-over-year changes for the first half. And you can see very strong performance right across the board, with the exception of market share where we were down just a touch. 
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 11, and we'll start breaking the Automotive segment down. This is a view of what happened on a year-over-year basis that resulted in a decline of $130 million. So when you look at it overall, you can see that the market factors, which is volume/mix and net pricing, was down. And that was driven by higher incentives, and that was mainly in the U.S. We will talk about that when we get to the North American slides. You can see exchange was an issue at $269 million. We did have some favorable cost performance, and that was largely driven by commodities. And then in Other to the far right, that was largely the gain on sale of an equity investment. I'll touch on it a bit when we get to North America.
Okay, let's go into North America on Slide 12 and look at the key metrics. Again, very strong quarter for North America. The top line was essentially flat to very slightly up in the case of revenue. Market share, flat. But as was already mentioned, within that, the U.S. was up, and that was higher fleet performance, but also, we had very strong retail share improvement for F-Series. Canada was up, Mexico was down. That's how we ended up with a sort of flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at margin, 11.3%. That was down 0.9%. But obviously, it is over 11%, that's an outstanding level of efficiency in performance for the North American operations, and then $2.7 billion. If you look down at the bottom of the slide, really strong results in the first half, best ever for North America. We had very strong growth. We grew the share 12.1% margin and $5.8 billion in profit, up 31%. So really strong performance in the first half for North America.
All right. Let's go to the next slide and look at what happened in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, here, the story is largely around incentives. If you look at the market factors, you can see that they were down on a net basis, driven by the incentives. And essentially, what we're seeing is over time, and particularly as the U.S. industry started to plateau and we're starting to get to a more mature part of the economic cycle in the U.S., we've seen sort of a very gradual rising, very modestly rising level of incentives for the industry, and we have been increasing along with that.
Now what you also have happening on a year-over-year basis, which is maybe a little bit unique to us, is the fact that a year ago, we had very low incentives for the F-150. If you remember, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City. I think it was around May when we got to full production. So we had very tight incentives, very high ATPs on F-150. We've become more normal, if you will. We're still in a good position relative to our peer set within the -- particularly our domestic peers in terms of ATPs for F-150 as well as incentives. But there was a factor of that [indiscernible] well. But there's no question that we've seen an increase, and that is more than what we had expected when we developed our plan at the beginning of the year. 
When you look at the cost, we were favorable on cost overall. That was again driven by incentives. Most of the good news -- or rather, commodities. Most of the good news on commodities in the company occurred in North America. 
And then to the far right, you can see the good news from that equity sale, which was the OEConnection sale that occurred in the quarter, and that benefited North America. 
Before we leave this slide, I just want to go back to mix. Mix is a very important part of the story across many of the business units. But certainly, North America was one of the strongest stories. That's product mix. In the case of North America, when I get to Europe, you're going to see the same thing along with good news on series mix and options. A very important part of what's happening. And so we're seeing sort of the car recession. But this has actually been part of our strategy, to focus on higher-margin, more profitable vehicles, but also where the consumers are going. 
The other thing I would just note on this slide is that we have picked up in warranty cost, you can see that in the callout box, that had a recall. That was about $100 million. And I just want to just digress for just a moment to say our approach inside Ford is unfortunately, recalls are a normal part of business. So we do not put recalls and special items or exclude them from margins or exclude them from operating results, as some of our other competitors do. It is, again, unfortunately, a normal part of business. We will report them in operating results. We always have. We always will. And if there's something of consequence that occurs, we'll just call it out, and you can make your own judgments in terms of whether that's a run rate or not. But certainly, they're lumpy."

The competitive environment has increased as growth has slowed and the retail industry demand has weakened, as we saw in the second quarter. And this has resulted in higher industry incentives with -- if you look at the retail industry sales rate, it's actually declined 3 out of the last 4 months. So the bottom line is that we've seen a tougher pricing environment this quarter, and we will face one going forward. And as Bob mentioned, with the car segment the most impacted as various competitors look to protect their share."

In South America, this is a story that is very much what it's been the last number of quarters. External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a decline in the top line, you can see double digits. In the case of revenue, you can see it was down 17%. That decline is entirely due to the weaker currencies.
Market share was down as we focused on the most profitable parts of our portfolio amid increasing discounts across the industry. And then you can see the results in terms of margin and pretax results. This is largely what you're also seeing in the first half. I will say that the team has done a -- continues to do a good job of focusing on the things that it can manage, particularly on cost.
And if you go to the next slide, on Slide 15, you can see the results of that. We once again delivered very strong cost performance. So if you think about last year, we delivered over $400 million, have good news on cost performance, we had good news in the first quarter, another good tranche of performance here in the second quarter. But as you can see, just to the left of that, we continued to see difficulties in pricing, enough to be able to offset the effects of high local inflation and the weaker local currencies. 
Industry, still an issue, as you can see in the volume and mix. And then the balance sheet actually helped us this time. This was the strengthening of the Argentinian peso. We are seeing good things in Argentina as the new government is really getting traction in terms of turning that economy in the better direction. And so that gave us some good news in the quarter.
Okay. Let's go on to Europe, which, as I mentioned earlier, was a bright spot for us. If you look at the wholesales and the revenue, up double digits. Share actually declined a little bit. That was market mix. The Southern European markets grew, if you will, disproportionately. Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe, and so that affected us. 
Margin was 5.8%, which is very, very good performance, and the profit that I touched on earlier. And then if you look at the first half, we made $900 million in the quarter, a margin of 6%. And you can see very strong growth at the top line as well, and share was flat. So this was a really great story. 
The other thing I want to highlight, we're committed to Russia. We stayed in Russia. We've been working to make sure that we're responding to the environment in Russia, and it's paying off. Within the good news that we saw in the quarter, Russia was actually a good part of that.
And on that note, let's turn to the year-over-year on Slide 17. And you can see the improvement of $300 million. It was market performance. It was a favorable cost performance. And then in the case of exchange, this is the first time that you'll see us talking about Brexit. We had bad news of about $60 million on the balance sheet related to the weak sterling. And one of the things that's important to note is that our strategy on hedging for the company is to go into a year with certain of our key currencies completely hedged from an operational exposure point of view. So we came into the year with the sterling and the euro completely hedged. So we don't see any issues relative to the weakness of the sterling on an operating basis for the balance of the year. We have about 60% of next year's exposure already covered, and there's a little bit that's also covered all the way out into 2018.
When we talk about the Brexit effect later, you have to remember the $60 million because there is an impact in the second half that we'll talk about that's related to a weaker industry."

But we saw that growth starting to decline in the second quarter ahead of the Brexit. And so far, as we look at July, by our reckoning, the industry is actually up in the U.K.; but on a retail basis, it's down. So as we look going forward, the industry could be down 5% to 10% for the rest of the year, depending upon which outside forecast you'll look at. But even within that, we'll continue to work to deliver consistent market performance, including obviously continuing our strong growth in commercial vehicles."

And that is related again to weak industry or weaker industry in the U.K. And then, also, you start to pick up a little bit of bad news on exchange because of the fact that the hedging is only 60% in place for next year and less than that in 2018. So that's what we're looking at. We're not going beyond that in terms of what happens once they actually leave because there's just too much uncertainty, particularly around what will happen with tariff barriers.
Okay. All right. Let's go on, and we'll talk about the Middle East and Africa on Slide 18. I mean, this is a story of just a bad business environment. If anything can go wrong, it seems like it has. It's low oil. It's weak currencies. There's political strife. In South Africa, we've seen labor disruptions. I mean, it's just, you name it, it's happening. And the result has been really weak industries. I mean, we're seeing declines of 30%, 40% in some of our markets. In some other countries, access to currency and so forth, it's pretty difficult. But you can see the effect of that has only been a modest increase in the loss. The team has actually done a great job of working the cost it can control because it does import most of the vehicles that it sells from other business units. But they've actually done a great job on cost, and they've done a good job on pricing. 
And if you look at the market share, while it looks like it's down and, in fact, it is, that is driven by the growth of the Iranian industry, which we don't participate in. The overall region is down 300,000 units; within that, Iran is up 300. So if we take Iran out, the team has actually increased our share by 0.6 point. So they're really doing a great job on share, on cost. But the headwinds across the region are just so large that we're kind of swimming in place at the moment.
Okay, let's go on to Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is an interesting story. We saw a decline in wholesales. Some of that was expected because we did have a planned 8-week shutdown of our Chongqing #1 assembly plant. That was for a complete overhaul of the paint booth there. So that was expected. But frankly, there were performance issues at Ford as well. There were also issues in terms of industry segmentation that we'll touch on. 
If you look at revenue, revenue was up 17%. We did see a decline in market share, that was China. And if you look at the margins, obviously, we were just below breakeven in margins and pretax results; and as I mentioned earlier, the first loss we've had in quite a number of quarters. And if you look at the year-to-date results, we've seen the top line grow share as well. But again, our operating margin and pretax results down from the year ago. 
I would highlight in the far right of this slide, our China joint ventures, on an equity after-tax basis, contributed about $300 million of profit. That was down about 28%. We still have very healthy margins there at 16.1%. I think that was down about 1.2 points from where we were this time a year ago. 
What we have on Slide 20 is a bit of what happened in terms of market share in China in the period, which really drove what happened in the region. So if you look at the far left, last year, we did 5.3%. China were down about 0.9 point. And you can see the factors that drove that. Half of it was basically external. Industry mix, what that means, the mix of the industry was stronger on passenger vehicles, it was weaker on commercial vehicles. We have joint ventures that participate, 2 different ones that participate in each one of those.
The segmentation issue is that within commercial vehicles, it was down, but it was actually up in the very low margin in many commercial segment, which we don't participate in. So if you think about the part we participate in, it was even lower. And so that was the effect that it had on our share from both those -- the industry mix change and then the segmentation within commercial vehicles. 
And then on performance, we were off 0.4 point, and that was largely around weakness in the C segment and the small utilities, where we're seeing a lot of competition from the domestics that are really coming up strongly and with really better products. And so it was a difficult situation for us. 
We also had some go-to-market strategies, frankly. And the team immediately saw these issues there. They actually started to occur in March. Immediate action was taken to address these issues. And you can see, looking at the share in April, May and June, we started to get back on track. And we feel like the second half of the year is going to be better for us and supported, in part, by a number of new product launches that are important that will help us."

So our mix of more profitable vehicles, such as medium and large cars and SUVs and premium cars, now account for about 40% of our sales in China, and that's up 5 points versus last year. So as Bob mentioned, we've taken actions to improve our market performance. And we have a number of important launches, the Taurus with the 1.5-liter engine. It will be the only large car eligible for the purchase tax incentive. The new Cougar, the new Mondeo, the Lincoln MKZ and Continental. And the majority of these launches will benefit us in the fourth quarter, not so much the third quarter."

Let's go to Slide 21, and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I'll then explain what you can see. I'm going to explain to you what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about. So you can see market factors were slightly negative, both pricing and then you can see volume/mix pretty flat. Within that, there actually was a quite good news on mix. So with that mix and other, it was more like around $60 million, $70 million of favorable mix, and that's along the lines of what Mark talked about. 
When you look at the cost performance, it was up. We expected it to be up. It actually isn't up as much as what we had expected. And then exchange, this is a story of a weaker renminbi. As Brexit has occurred and it affected the sterling and the euro, the Chinese are now kind of targeting their currency against the basket of currencies, not just the dollar. As those weakened, we saw the Chinese start to push down the renminbi and the response to that, and that had an effect on us. 
What we had expected to see in the quarter, we didn't expect the loss, obviously, was the fact that we have stronger market factors. And that pricing in China has been worse than what we thought. We thought 5% to 6%. Actually, year-to-date, it's approaching 7% or high 6s. We're at about 7% or so. We think this will mitigate in the balance of the year because if you look at last year, the decline was largely sort of from this point through the rest of the year. So we think it will mitigate, and we'll end up at the high end of that range.
And when you look at the volume and mix, that was the share which we talked about. So it seems all over. We're working on it. But that's really what happened to us in Asia Pacific in the quarter.
Let's go on to Slide 22, and we'll turn to Ford Credit.  Ford Credit grew, that's the first 2 metrics, double digits, and that was really around the world. If you look at the pretax results, the $400 million, that was down 21%. I'll show you why in just a minute. If you look at sort of the portfolio performance, very healthy FICO scores, in a good place; delinquencies up a bit, although I'll say something about that in just a minute in terms of credit losses. And the loss receivables, up 15 basis points, actually about where it's been the last 2 or 3 quarters. It's just up a bit from the last 2 or 3, up more from a year ago. And starting to approach what the level of LTR that we saw before the Great Recession. So this is just getting back to sort of normal levels. It's not an issue per se. 
All right, let's go on to the next slide and look at the year-over-year. So the decline was largely around lease residuals and credit losses. In terms of lease residuals, it's really 2 things, and it's in the callout box. If you look at the residual gains and losses, you can see on a year-over-year basis the declines. So these are vehicles that come back. Do we lose money or do we gain money? We actually gained money on the returned vehicles in the quarter. We just didn't gain as much as we did a year ago. So that's how we end up with the negative number.
And then in terms of supplemental depreciation, this is a reflection of lower auction values and a projection of lower lease-in values, particularly for smaller vehicles. We have adjusted our depreciation glide path to those new lower end points, and that's what's reflected there. 
When you look at the credit losses, this is largely around a couple of things. You can see the charge-offs. Those are the vehicles that we actually repossessed and then we took back to market and resold. And you can see there was a decline there of $34 million, and then we had to increase the reserve by $31 million. 
But the thing I wanted to mention on this is a number of things going on in here. But while the delinquencies are up a little bit, what we're seeing happen is that a number of people who actually default once they are delinquent, if you will, is increasing versus where it has been. It's not a level that's of concern. It's actually just coming back again to a level that's more normal. I think there've been a number of articles from banks and others around that, but that's one of the factors. The other thing is at the severities. So when we do take them back to the auction market, the severities are greater, in part, because of what I mentioned in terms of the lease-in values of the vehicles are lower overall. But also, because of the longer terms, people are -- the portfolio of people are turning their vehicles a bit earlier and so the severities are greater. Because of all of those factors, we also have had to increase the reserve in addition to the fact that this is just bigger. And so we have to increase the reserve in line with just the larger business. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide, and this is looking at trends. I'm just going to talk to the 2 on the right. I think I've already covered the 2 -- 2 on the left, the 2 on the right I've covered. We said in the first quarter that our lease penetration would decline, it did by 3 points in the second quarter. We think, again, for the full year, it will be lower than it was in the first quarter. And you can see that we dropped a bit more than what the overall industry did.
And in the lower left, this is around what we talked about, the auction values. This is a constant mix. So it's mix the same as the second quarter. You can see that we are pretty flat in terms of values in the second quarter compared to the first, but down from where we were a year ago, and that's largely around the smaller vehicles. 
Okay. Let's turn now to cash flow. Cash flow, a very, very good story for us in the quarter. It was the best ever in the quarter and the half, $4.2 billion operating in the quarter, $6.9 billion in the half. It was driven by the profit, but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we have favorable timing differences. When we look at the full year, we do expect that the $6.9 billion will come down. So what we achieved in the first half will come down because we do see negative cash flow in the second quarter, largely driven by the third quarter. And we'll come back to that in just a minute. But we think, largely, this is around the fact that working capital and the favorable timing differences will reverse by the time we get to the end of the year.
I will note on this slide, we're taking our capital spending projection down. The guidance had been $7.7 billion. We're taking that down to $7 billion. It's largely around efficiencies on programs that are coming to a conclusion. And we're seeing we delivered them more efficiently, and also, lower non-product spending.
Okay, let's go to the balance sheet summary. This is a new slide we've developed just to capture all the balance sheet metrics. The only thing I'll say here is the Automotive balance sheet, very, very strong. Ford Credit continues to be well-capitalized and strong as well. And then, finally, in terms of pensions, we're still on track to have the pensions largely funded and derisked by the end of the year.
Okay. Now let's switch gears and let's talk more now about what lies ahead, not only in the second half, but for the full year. And we'll touch very briefly on 2017 and, of course, talk more about that at Investor Day in the middle of September. So what this slide basically says is compared with our prior expectations, our prior guidance, when you look at GDP, we now expect global U.S. and Europe GDP to be somewhat softer than what we had expected. Brazil and China, pretty much in line with what we've expected since the beginning of the year.
When we look at industry volume, we do think the global industry volume is likely to be a bit higher than what we had expected. That is driven by primarily China, but also Europe is doing a bit better than we had expected, at the high end of the range that we guided to earlier in the year. The softness is in the U.S. that is largely on the retail side of the business, and also in Brazil.
Now let's go on to a 2 special attention slides that we provided to help you understand the second half and also our view of the full year. So the first thing I want to highlight is when you look at the far left, that's the $6.8 billion company profit in the first half, record results, fantastic. What is in there, though, is important to understand. A lot of the issues and risks that we will talk about for the full year, they were there in the first half. They started to appear in the first quarter and then the second quarter unfolded. 
We offset those risks with $1.6 billion of favorable cost performance versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So it wasn't an easy quarter or easy half. We had to work to get there. But the important message of this is that those risks flow into the second half. So for us to deliver the guidance that we're committed to deliver for the full year, we have to do that all over again. We're going to have to deliver stronger actions on costs. We're going to have to go back and look at the top line as well and find every dollar of revenue that we can get. That's what that next to last bar represents, the profit improvement actions. So we do that, and we're committed to doing that, then we're able to deliver the guidance, which again we're committed to do, and that's what the right-hand bar reflects.
What we're highlighting in between there with the red bars are the factors that are going to drive to a lower second half than as normal. Second half is normally lower. That's what the first red bar represents. But there's some other actions in there that I won't go through individually, other than I'll touch on Super Duty that will give us a lower second half than what would be normal. 
Super Duty is a very, very important product. It's high volume, and it's very high margin. It's a big change over because we have not had a complete redesign of this product for 19, 20 years. It's going into a big plant. It's aluminum. It's a new frame. It's powertrain upgrades. It's new features. It's new technologies. So we really haven't touched a lot of this product for 19 years. So when we make this change, obviously, it's going to have an impact in the quarter from the launch effect and so forth, the cost. But even as we go through the quarter, we expect to have some impact because we do think we'll have lower contribution margins coming out of this than what we had going in. 
Still very high contribution margins, among the best in the portfolio. But the new product, which will be far superior than the one we have today and certainly, positioned the product to be a winner and the leader over the next decade and meet the regulatory requirements that we have to meet, there will be lower contribution margins when we come out of the launch. And that will flow through into the fourth quarter and the forward years. Now what will happen over time is we'll start to get the cost reductions, which we normally get, which is what benefited the older F-Series over the course of that 19-year cycle.
But it will also drive a weaker-than-normal third quarter, along with some of these other factors. So to put that into context, usually, the third quarter is about 1/4 of our full year results. It's likely to be half of that or lower, and that's largely around the F-Series effect. 
So let's go to the next slide. Some of those risks that we talked about that were in the first quarter largely -- or first half and that flowed through into the year is shown here. It's around higher Ford and industry incentives. We talked about that. They're up. We're up in line with that. The weakness or the softness in the U.S. retail industry. We see the second half actually being softer than the first half on an absolute basis. Again, that is -- it's retail. These are absolutely strong levels. They're just not as strong as what we had expected. And in fact, looking into '17, we think that we'll see further softness as the cycle matures. 
If you go down the page, Middle East and Africa, I've already talked about it, that's going to continue. The situation that we're facing, we are responding to that. In Asia Pacific, the higher -- the lower net pricing, the weaker exchange. We saw that. We're still dealing with it. And in Ford Credit, we have addressed the U.S. auction values, but it will give us a lower second half, in line with what we saw in the first half when we earned over $900 million.
The opportunity is Europe. We made a lot of money in Europe in the first half. Clearly have opportunity what we -- versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but we have to deal with Brexit, and we talked about that already. So we see these risks. We have seen them since the beginning of the year. We've been dealing with them very successfully. We will do so in the second half. But that is work that is still yet ahead of us.
And Mark will talk to that in his comments, which I'll turn over to him now."

But as we mentioned, we're facing risks to achieving that.
Now I'd like to talk about what we're going to do about it. And if you go to Slide 31, it shows you the improvement actions that we already have underway in the company. So to start, as we match production to demand and be very consistent around that, that will help reduce manufacturing costs. We've implemented an aggressive company-wide attack plan on costs. And as Bob mentioned, it builds on the considerable cost progress that we achieved in the first half of the year with that $1.6 billion in cost improvements that we delivered versus our plan. And as you can imagine, it looks at everything, from material cost to marketing and selling efficiencies, to freight and admin reductions.
Now at the same time, we have to put special attention on our go-to-market plans in the U.S. and China to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities. In addition, we're also utilizing our expanded data and analytics team to really pinpoint immediate areas of improvement in our market factors, including better volume and mix and pricing, which will in turn drive revenue.
And then, finally, we have a number of significant vehicle launches around the world this year. And we are challenging our team to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities as we launch those vehicles and take advantage of those launches. So we're aggressively executing on all these actions. And of course, we'll provide an update on our progress during our Investor Day on September 14. 
So in summary, and turning to Slide 32, again, I'd like to put the quarter in context for you. We had a strong second quarter, we had record cash flow and we had a record start to this year. And at the same time, we're seeing more pressure throughout the business for the remainder of the year. Now some of it, as we discussed, is expected, such as the launch of the Super Duty in North America. And some of it is not expected, such as the higher Ford and industry incentives in North America, a softening of the U.S. retail industry and uncertainty in Europe due to the Brexit effects.
So as a result, we're calling the second half of this year, and particularly the third quarter, to be much weaker than normal. Now I just want to caution you against using the second half of the year as an indicative run rate for 2017. It isn't. We expect 2017 to be another solid year for Ford despite the likely absence of growth in the U.S. industry volume and Brexit effects in Europe.
Now I think you know us very well. The Ford team remains committed to delivering our plan for this year, but we also have a long track record of calling risks as soon as we see them and acting decisively to deal with them. And that's exactly what we're doing today.
So with that, we'd love to take your questions."

First, we talked about the inventory situation at the end of 1Q. Certainly, we track how it's developing during 2Q. And even backing out Super Duty safety stock, it looked like, coming into the quarter, there was a fair amount of inventory. How much of the incentive activity has been related to working that down and perhaps versus sort of broader trends?

Bob will take the first one on the industry sales. Here's how I think we'd characterize the market. If you recall, the -- vehicle sales for the industry grew at a really good pace in the early stages of the economic recovery. And if you recall, it actually outpaced the overall economic growth at the time. And so while the industry remains at fairly healthy levels, the competitive environment has intensified as that growth has moderated and as we've seen some of the softness in the retail demand. And in that environment, you've seen, as we said, incentives creep up, and we've been about in line with that. But also, I think what it will result in probably for the remainder of this year, Brian, is a fairly volatile kind of SAR factor from month-to-month because that will be influenced by any particular OEM or brand that wants to increase their incentives to maybe use their market share or whatever. As we get in -- so the bottom line is we expect in the second half of this year that the retail industry to be lower than the year ago. As we get into 2017, obviously, we'll talk more about that in the future, but as Bob mentioned, we do expect the industry to be probably slightly down in 2017."

And Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at higher levels of inventory as we were -- particularly in the early part of the year because of 2 factors: one, we had to prepare for the Super Duty launch, which we touched on; and also, because of the fact that many of our plants are running at 3 crew. And so as a result, there will be periods where it's low absolute volume months, where the inventory will be -- if we do supply the whole high, but it's to support the higher volume months of the year, particularly in the spring and the end of the year into the summer and so forth. So we're comfortable with the levels that we've been at. The thing that's kind of interesting in terms of responding to the softness has not been around incentives, it's been making production adjustments. Because if you look in the first half at -- I mean, you would see this, but I'm telling you this, if you look at the wholesales that we had planned, they are higher or were higher than what we actually delivered. Because even as we saw some of the softness that we've talked about occur in the first half of the year, Joe Hinrichs and the team are making production adjustments along the way. So we ended up with lower wholesales in the half than what we had expected. I mean, that's how we primarily deal with that. It's just adjusting production to demand. That's what we'll do in the second half, which what Mark talked about in his comments. So the incentives, I think, are different. The incentives are really sort of a environmental issue, if you will, across the industry. And then for us, I think there's a piece of what I talked about earlier around the normalization in this period versus a year ago with F-150."

We're bringing new analytical tools to the table to help the marketing and sales teams be really focused and targeted in terms where to find that extra dollar that's sitting there.

There's no question about that because the second half will be lower. They usually are lower in the second half. This will be a weaker than normal second half. So that is what it's going to happen. I will just go back to '14. If you think about '14, North America had lower margins than it had been running at because of the launch of F-150, and then they bounced back up in 2015, particularly the second half, and then early this year. So what we're seeing is a really big launch. It's not going to take much as volume out as those launches did because we've learned so much from them. But it's a really big launch, and it's going to have an effect. It's really around all these other issues and the softening of the industry and the higher incentives. Those are the things that we're working on. And I would actually call them sort of early signs of the maturation of the cycle. The structure that we put in place in North America was designed to give us good results and good performance when things get tough, and it is getting a little bit tougher. That's what we're seeing, but I think the structure of the business is good. And oh, by the way, remember that $1.6 billion of cost performance you talked about, a lot of that was delivered in North America. So we're keeping it up in terms of the structure of the business with what we're seeing happen. So I think we're good shape in terms of the robustness of their structure and prepared for that eventual downturn."

But to your question, Colin, what you will see overall, particularly, in the second half, you'll see a bigger-than-normal cost increase, and that will also be something that you'll see for the full year. We had great performance on a year-over-year basis in the first half. Some of that is because it was a relatively quiet product period for us, if you will, overall, globally, but when we get into the second half, we have Super Duty. We've got the continental. We have some of the launches in North America that will take place in China. But very importantly, and we'll talk more about this when we get to Investor Day. That was one of the bars on that waterfall chart, which was around product investment. We have been seeing an increase in product investment from Ford over the last number of years that, actually, as we got bigger, we expanded the portfolio, invested more in technologies. We went into new markets. We added capacity, particularly in emerging markets. Going forward, we're going to be completely replacing the C-platform. We're going to be completely replacing the C/D platform. We are investing heavily in electrification. Adam's point around autonomous vehicles, that's underway as we speak. There's regulatory requirements that we have to meet, which bring with it added investment as well. So you will see an increase in both capital spending and engineering, and you see some of that even in the second half relative to the first half because what we're showing you is an increase that's higher-than-normal. Normally, we see that happen. It's even higher-than-normal. And as we go into next year, that will be a factor. So you will see higher costs overall in the year versus a year ago that will largely occur in the second half of the year. But we don't expect to be down by the time we get into the end of the year.

It is now plateauing. And I think the industry and all the players in the industry, we have to kind of pivot. We have to transition, and I think that's what's occurring. And the reason I'm encouraged by the -- encouraged to think that will occur successfully is the fact that, not only us, but everyone, all the big players are very, very focused on margins. They know that's important. They know that's what counts. They're focused on that. And I really believe that, ultimately, that will be the driver of decisions around how aggressively people go after a pie that isn't growing frankly anymore. The other thing that's probably different than it's been over the last 2 or 3 years is the yen. The yen has started to shrink in -- from the levels it has reached. I think it got to about a 120 level. It's been 100, 103, 105. I mean, that certainly puts some constraints on the Japanese participants in the market in terms of maybe some of the benefits and the windfalls of the weaker yens that they were deploying that just isn't there anymore.

But first of all, we'll get out of some of the one-time unique issues that we saw in the second half and maybe to some extent, in the first half. But you'll also see, I think it does appear in these articles that are being written that the emerging market downturn, perhaps, globally is beginning to bottom out. I talked about the fact that Russia's already improving in terms of our own portfolio. There's a question earlier around South America. Our view, early view anyway, is that there could be very, very, very small levels of growth there next year, nothing to write home about, but it would be great to see a positive number with no brackets around it. And so that would be, perhaps, the beginning of the turn there and decline of the increased losses. So that's going to help. We're going to have, again, as we always do, a lot of product launches. And I think, going back to the earlier question around the portfolio, we really are focusing our investments very specifically to where we can make money. And I think that will be a phenomenon that will be even it, sharper Focus, going ahead, and I think that will benefit, for example, the Ford new SUVs that we've talked about globally. I mean those are the sweet spot of where our consumers are going. Those are high-margin products. That will start to help us as we move ahead, and the cost, I mean, we're going to really be -- we will see cost increases, I'll call them, that are healthy, to support the growing business, and certainly, to be a leader in all these emerging opportunities ahead. But other than that, we are going to be, as we have been, very focused on efficiencies and driving nonessential costs out of the business. We did that very successfully in the first half. We need to do that in the second and we're going to do that going forward as well."

So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of our best second quarters ever. And while pretax profits are down compared with last year's record second quarter, revenue was up 6%, so we grew the top line. 
Global market share declined outside of North America, but share was up in the U.S. and Canada. Our Automotive operating cash flow was an all-time quarterly record. Europe's pretax profit almost tripled from last year. And North America and Ford Credit remained strong. Now combined with our first quarter record, we achieved record first half pretax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America.
Now we continue to expect another strong year, and we're committed to our full year guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year. But at the same time, we now see a number of risks that the entire Ford team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance. And we'll explain more as we go through the information this morning.
Now turning to Slide 4. We remain absolutely focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value, and I'm pleased to say we made progress on each. As I mentioned, we grew our top line, and we announced actions to continue to grow our core business, including new global SUVs and also positive sales momentum at Lincoln. We also continued to pursue emerging opportunities, such as our investment in Pivotal, which will further strengthen our cloud-based software capabilities. 
Our returns were strong, as I just reviewed. Now in terms of risk, we received a rating upgrade by Fitch. Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter. And we achieved $1.6 billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million to our shareholders.
Now Slide 5 shows some of the other highlights in the quarter, and I won't go through each of these. But as you can see, they span everything from awards for our new products and engines, to progress in our quality efforts, to the launches of products and connected services. But I will just point out in quality, the J.D. Power IQS survey, Lincoln came in at #7 and Ford came in at #11, both improved and really puts an exclamation point on the efforts that our team has around continuously improving our quality for our customers.
Now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and how we see it on Slide 6. At the macro level, we're seeing higher levels of economic uncertainty. Financial markets and the sterling and euro are affected by Brexit. And global interest rates have been reverting to recent lows. Now U.S. growth is improving after a weak start that we saw at the beginning of the year, but we are seeing signs of a maturing U.S. recovery. We do expect continued growth in China, albeit that's supported by government stimulus measures. But we're also seeing increased pressures on margins. And while conditions in Brazil remain difficult, Russia is actually showing some signs of stabilization. 
Now for Ford, specifically, our risks are around lower pricing and higher incentives than we expected in the U.S. and China; a softer, although still strong, U.S. retail industry; the effects of Brexit on our operations in Europe; a more difficult external environment across many of our markets in Middle East and Africa; a weaker Chinese RMB; and lower-than-expected auction values for smaller vehicles leased in the U.S. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back at the end and cover our outlook. Bob?"

We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is",1490,"Okay. Thank you, Mark. We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is the third column. 
So as Mark said, it was a strong quarter for us. And to demonstrate that, if we look at the company adjusted pretax results, you can see $3 billion, which was down 9% from a year ago. But it was, as Mark said, one of the strongest second quarters that we've had. If you go down further to net income attributable to Ford at $2 billion. That was also down 9% and adjusted earnings per share down 4%. 
If you go to the bottom of the chart, you can see the liquidity metrics. I'll come back to those later, so I won't go through them individually at this point, but you can see they were very, very strong. If you look at the year-to-date column, let's hit the same lines on the chart. Our company adjusted pretax results at $6.8 billion. Remember, we had the best ever first quarter. So when we combine that with the strong second quarter, we ended up with a record for the first half $6.8 billion, that was up 35%. And net income of $4.4 billion, that was up 33%. And then the adjusted earnings per share for the first half at $1.20, up 45%.
Let's go on to the next slide, Slide 9. And here, what I want to focus on are the absolutes before we get into some of the details within both the Automotive segment and Ford Credit. Looking at the Automotive segment, you can see the strong result at North America at $2.7 billion. It was down about 5%. Europe was clearly a highlight among all the business units in the quarter. It was up 3x from where we were last year, the best second quarter result ever. And that included some impact from Brexit, which I'll talk about in just a minute. But really, a great result in Europe. 
And if you look at the Financial Services, that includes a $400 million profit from Ford Credit. It was down, and I'll explain what was behind that. If you look at the other business units, they were all in losses. South America, $265 million, down a bit. Middle East and Africa, down also at a $65 million loss. And then we had our first loss in Asia Pacific in 13 quarters at $8 million, and that decline was driven largely by China, and we'll talk about that later in the presentation as well. I will highlight here All Other. That's one of our new segments. That is primarily, in this quarter, net interest expense.
Okay, let's go on to Slide 10. And as usual, we'll look at the key metrics for the Automotive sector. Very strong absolutes across the board, but when you look at the comparisons versus last year, some mixed results. Wholesale is flat. Revenue, up 5%. Market share, Mark explained that, it was down everywhere but in North America. And the operating margin was a strong 7.7% and the result at $2.8 billion. And then if you look at the very bottom of the page, we've provided you with the same metrics and the year-over-year changes for the first half. And you can see very strong performance right across the board, with the exception of market share where we were down just a touch. 
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 11, and we'll start breaking the Automotive segment down. This is a view of what happened on a year-over-year basis that resulted in a decline of $130 million. So when you look at it overall, you can see that the market factors, which is volume/mix and net pricing, was down. And that was driven by higher incentives, and that was mainly in the U.S. We will talk about that when we get to the North American slides. You can see exchange was an issue at $269 million. We did have some favorable cost performance, and that was largely driven by commodities. And then in Other to the far right, that was largely the gain on sale of an equity investment. I'll touch on it a bit when we get to North America.
Okay, let's go into North America on Slide 12 and look at the key metrics. Again, very strong quarter for North America. The top line was essentially flat to very slightly up in the case of revenue. Market share, flat. But as was already mentioned, within that, the U.S. was up, and that was higher fleet performance, but also, we had very strong retail share improvement for F-Series. Canada was up, Mexico was down. That's how we ended up with a sort of flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at margin, 11.3%. That was down 0.9%. But obviously, it is over 11%, that's an outstanding level of efficiency in performance for the North American operations, and then $2.7 billion. If you look down at the bottom of the slide, really strong results in the first half, best ever for North America. We had very strong growth. We grew the share 12.1% margin and $5.8 billion in profit, up 31%. So really strong performance in the first half for North America.
All right. Let's go to the next slide and look at what happened in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, here, the story is largely around incentives. If you look at the market factors, you can see that they were down on a net basis, driven by the incentives. And essentially, what we're seeing is over time, and particularly as the U.S. industry has started to plateau and we're starting to get to a more mature part of the economic cycle in the U.S., we've seen sort of a very gradual rising, very modestly rising level of incentives for the industry, and we have been increasing along with that.
Now what you also have happening on a year-over-year basis, which is maybe a little bit unique to us, is the fact that a year ago, we had very low incentives for the F-150. If you remember, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City. I think it was around May when we got to full production. So we had very tight incentives, very high ATPs on F-150. We've become more normal, if you will. We're still in a good position relative to our peer set within the -- particularly our domestic peers in terms of ATPs for F-150 as well as incentives. But there was a factor of that in our incentives [ph] as well. But there's no question that we've seen an increase, and that is more than what we had expected when we developed our plan at the beginning of the year. 
When you look at costs, we were favorable on costs overall. That was again driven by incentives. Most of the good news -- or rather, commodities. Most of the good news on commodities in the company occurred in North America. 
And then to the far right, you can see the good news from that equity sale, which was the OEConnection sale that occurred in the quarter, and that benefited North America. 
Before we leave this slide, I just want to go back to mix. Mix is a very important part of the story across many of the business units. But certainly, North America was one of the stronger stories. That's product mix. In the case of North America, when I get to Europe, you're going to see the same thing along with good news on series mix and options. A very important part of what's happening as we're seeing sort of the car recession. But this has actually been part of our strategy, to focus on higher-margin, more profitable vehicles, but also where the consumers are going. 
The other thing I would just note on this slide is that we have picked up in warranty cost, you can see that in the callout box, the Takata recall. That was about $100 million. And I just want to just digress for just a moment to say our approach inside Ford is unfortunately, recalls are a normal part of business. So we do not put recalls in special items or exclude them from margins or exclude them from operating results, as some of our other competitors do. It is, again, unfortunately, a normal part of business. We will report them in operating results. We always have. We always will. And if there's something of consequence that occurs, we'll just call it out, and you can make your own judgments in terms of whether that's a run rate or not. But certainly, they're lumpy."

In South America, this is a story that is very much what it's been the last number of quarters. External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a decline in the top line, you can see double digits. In the case of revenue, you can see it was down 17%. That decline is entirely due to the weaker currencies.
Market share was down as we focused on the most profitable parts of our portfolio amid increasing discounts across the industry. And then you can see the results in terms of margin and pretax results. This is largely what you're also seeing in the first half. I will say that the team has done a -- continues to do a good job of focusing on the things that it can manage, particularly on cost.
And if you go to the next slide, on Slide 15, you can see the results of that. We once again delivered very strong cost performance. So if you think about last year, we delivered over $400 million of good news on cost performance, we had good news in the first quarter, another good tranche of performance here in the second quarter. But as you can see, just to the left of that, we continued to see difficulties in pricing, enough to be able to offset the effects of high local inflation and the weaker local currencies. 
Industry, still an issue, as you can see in the volume and mix. And then the balance sheet actually helped us this time. This was the strengthening of the Argentinian peso. We are seeing good things in Argentina as the new government is really getting traction in terms of turning that economy in the better direction. And so that gave us some good news in the quarter.
Okay. Let's go on to Europe, which, as I mentioned earlier, was a bright spot for us. If you look at the wholesales and the revenue, up double digits. Share actually declined a little bit. That was market mix. The Southern European markets grew, if you will, disproportionately. Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe, and so that affected us. 
Margin was 5.8%, which is very, very good performance, and the profit that I had touched on earlier. And then if you look at the first half, we made $900 million in the quarter, a margin of 6%. And you can see very strong growth at the top line as well, and share was flat. So this was a really great story. 
The other thing I want to highlight, we're committed to Russia. We stayed in Russia. We've been working to make sure that we're responding to the environment in Russia, and it's paying off. Within the good news that we saw in the quarter, Russia was actually a good part of that.
And on that note, let's turn to the year-over-year on Slide 17. And you can see the improvement of $300 million. It was market performance. It was a favorable cost performance. And then in the case of exchange, this is the first time that you'll see us talking about Brexit. We had bad news of about $60 million on the balance sheet related to the weak sterling. And one of the things that's important to note is that our strategy on hedging for the company is to go into a year with certain of our key currencies completely hedged from an operational exposure point of view. So we came into the year with the sterling and the euro completely hedged. So we don't see any issues relative to the weakness of the sterling on an operating basis for the balance of the year. We have about 60% of next year's exposure already covered, and there's a little bit that's also covered all the way out into 2018.
When we talk about the Brexit effect later, you have to remember the $60 million because there is an impact in the second half that we'll talk about that's related to a weaker industry."

And that includes, as you can imagine, looking at consumer confidence levels amongst other indicators. And if you reflect, the industry back in the first quarter in the U.K. was at a record. But we saw that growth starting to decline in the second quarter ahead of the Brexit. And so far, as we look at July, by our reckoning, the industry is actually up in the U.K.; but on a retail basis, it's down. So as we look going forward, the industry could be down 5% to 10% for the rest of the year, depending upon which outside forecast you look at. But even within that, we'll continue to work to deliver consistent market performance, including obviously continuing our strong growth in commercial vehicles."

But we are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit. It's a $60 million with another $140 million, $150 million related to a weaker U.K. industry. When you get into '17 and '18, we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of $400 million to $500 million in each year. And that is related again to weak industry or weaker industry in the U.K. And then, also, you start to pick up a little bit of bad news on exchange because of the fact that the hedging is only 60% in place for next year and less than that in 2018. So that's what we're looking at. We're not going beyond that in terms of what happens once they actually leave because there's just too much uncertainty, particularly around what will happen with tariff barriers.
Okay. All right. Let's go on, and we'll talk about the Middle East and Africa on Slide 18. I mean, this is a story of just a bad business environment. If anything can go wrong, it seems like it has. It's low oil. It's weak currencies. There's political strife. In South Africa, we've seen labor disruptions. I mean, it's just, you name it, it's happening. And the result has been really weak industries. I mean, we're seeing declines of 30%, 40% in some of our markets. In some of the countries, access to currency and so forth, it's pretty difficult. But you can see the effect of that has only been a modest increase in the loss. The team has actually done a great job of working on the costs it can control because it does import most of the vehicles that it sells from other business units. But they've actually done a great job on costs, and they've done a good job on pricing. 
And if you look at the market share, while it looks like it's down and, in fact, it is, that is driven by the growth of the Iranian industry, which we don't participate in. The overall region is down 300,000 units; within that, Iran is up 300. So if we take Iran out, the team has actually increased our share by 0.6 point. So they're really doing a great job on share, on costs. But the headwinds across the region are just so large that we're kind of swimming in place at the moment.
Okay, let's go on to Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is an interesting story. We saw a decline in wholesales. Some of that was expected because we did have a planned 8-week shutdown of our Chongqing #1 assembly plant. That was for a complete overhaul of the paint booth there. So that was expected. But frankly, there were performance issues at Ford as well. There were also issues in terms of industry segmentation that we'll touch on. 
If you look at revenue, revenue was up 17%. We did see a decline in market share, that was China. And if you look at the margins, obviously, we were just below breakeven in margins and pretax results; and as I mentioned earlier, the first loss we've had in quite a number of quarters. And if you look at the year-to-date results, we've seen the top line grow share as well. But again, our operating margin and pretax results down from a year ago. 
I would highlight in the far right of this slide, our China joint ventures, on an equity after-tax basis, contributed about $300 million of profit. That was down about 28%. We still have very healthy margins there at 16.1%. I think that was down about 1.2 points from where we were this time a year ago. 
What we have on Slide 20 is a bit of what happened in terms of market share in China in the period, which really drove what happened in the region. So if you look at the far left, last year, we did 5.3%. China, we're down about 0.9 point. And you can see the factors that drove that. Half of it was basically external. Industry mix, what that means, the mix of the industry was stronger on passenger vehicles, it was weaker on commercial vehicles. We have joint ventures that participate, 2 different ones that participate in each one of those.
The segmentation issue is that within commercial vehicles, it was down, but it was actually up in the very low margin, mini-commercial segment, which we don't participate in. So if you think about the part we participate in, it was even lower. And so that was the effect that it had on our share from both those -- the industry mix change and then the segmentation within commercial vehicles. 
And then on performance, we were off 0.4 point, and that was largely around weakness in the C segment and the small utilities, where we're seeing a lot of competition from the domestics that are really coming up strongly and with really better products. And so it was a difficult situation for us. 
We also had some go-to-market strategies, frankly. And the team immediately saw these issues there. They actually started to occur in March. Immediate action was taken to address these issues. And you can see, looking at the share in April, May and June, we started to get back on track. And we feel like the second half of the year is going to be better for us and supported, in part, by a number of new product launches that are important that will help us."

In terms of our performance, we've also focused on the quality of our market share. So our mix of more profitable vehicles, such as medium and large cars and SUVs and premium cars, now account for about 40% of our sales in China, and that's up 5 points versus last year. So as Bob mentioned, we've taken actions to improve our market performance. And we have a number of important launches, the Taurus with the 1.5-liter engine. It will be the only large car eligible for the purchase tax incentive. The new Cougar, the new Mondeo, the Lincoln MKZ and Continental. And the majority of these launches will benefit us in the fourth quarter, not so much the third quarter."

I'm going to explain to you what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about. So you can see m",2446,"Okay. Let's go to Slide 21, and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I'm going to explain what you can see. I'm going to explain to you what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about. So you can see market factors were slightly negative, both pricing and then you can see volume/mix pretty flat. Within that, there actually was a quite good news on mix. So with that mix and other, it was more like around $60 million, $70 million of favorable mix, and that's along the lines of what Mark talked about. 
When you look at the cost performance, it was up. We expected it to be up. It actually isn't up as much as what we had expected. And then exchange, this is a story of a weaker renminbi. As Brexit has occurred and it affected the sterling and the euro, the Chinese are now kind of targeting their currency against a basket of currencies, not just the dollar. As those weakened, we saw the Chinese start to push down the renminbi and the response to that, and that had an effect on us. 
What we had expected to see in the quarter, we didn't expect the loss, obviously, was the fact that we'd have stronger market factors. The net pricing in China has been worse than what we thought. We thought 5% to 6%. Actually, year-to-date, it's approaching 7% or high 6s. We're at about 7% or so. We think this will mitigate in the balance of the year because if you look at last year, the decline was largely sort of from this point through the rest of the year. So we think it will mitigate, and we'll end up at the high end of that range.
And when you look at the volume and mix, that was the share issue that we talked about. So team's all over it. We're working on it. But that's really what happened to us in Asia Pacific in the quarter.
Let's go on to Slide 22, and we'll turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit grew, that's the first 2 metrics, double digits, and that was really around the world. If you look at the pretax results, the $400 million, that was down 21%. I'll show you why in just a minute. If you look at sort of the portfolio performance, very healthy FICO scores, in a good place; delinquencies up a bit, although I'll say something about that in just a minute in terms of credit losses. And the loss receivables, up 15 basis points, actually about where it's been the last 2 or 3 quarters. It's just up a bit from the last 2 or 3, up more from a year ago. And starting to approach what the level of LTR that we saw before the Great Recession. So this is just getting back to sort of normal levels. It's not an issue per se. 
All right, let's go on to the next slide and look at the year-over-year. So the decline was largely around lease residuals and credit losses. In terms of lease residuals, it's really 2 things, and it's in the callout box. If you look at the residual gains and losses, you can see on a year-over-year basis the declines. So these are vehicles that come back. Do we lose money or do we gain money? We actually gained money on the returned vehicles in the quarter. We just didn't gain as much as we did a year ago. So that's how we ended up with the negative number.
And then in terms of supplemental depreciation, this is a reflection of lower auction values and a projection of lower lease-in values, particularly for smaller vehicles. We have adjusted our depreciation glide path to those new lower end points, and that's what's reflected there. 
When you look at the credit losses, this is largely around a couple of things. You can see the charge-offs. Those are the vehicles that we actually repossessed and then we took back to market and resold. And you can see there was a decline there of $34 million, and then we had to increase the reserve by $31 million. 
But the thing I wanted to mention on this is a number of things going on in here. But while the delinquencies are up a little bit, what we're seeing happen is that the number of people who actually default once they are delinquent, if you will, is increasing versus where it has been. It's not a level that's of concern. It's actually just coming back again to a level that's more normal. I think there've been a number of articles from banks and others around that, but that's one of the factors. The other thing is that the severities -- so when we do take them back to the auction market, the severities are greater, in part, because of what I mentioned in terms of the lease-in values of the vehicles are lower overall. But also, because of the longer terms, people are -- the portfolio of people are turning their vehicles a bit earlier and so the severities are greater. Because of all of those factors, we also have had to increase the reserve in addition to the fact that business is just bigger. And so we have to increase the reserve in line with just the larger business. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide, and this is looking at trends. I'm just going to talk to the 2 on the right. I think I've already covered the 2 -- 2 on the left, the 2 on the right I've covered. We said in the first quarter that our lease penetration would decline, it did by 3 points in the second quarter. We think, again, for the full year, it will be lower than it was in the first quarter. And you can see that we dropped a bit more than what the overall industry did.
And in the lower left, this is around what we talked about, the auction values. This is a constant mix. So it's mix the same as the second quarter. You can see that we are pretty flat in terms of values in the second quarter compared to the first, but down from where we were a year ago, and that's largely around the smaller vehicles. 
Okay. Let's turn now to cash flow. Cash flow, a very, very good story for us in the quarter. It was the best ever in the quarter and the half, $4.2 billion operating in the quarter, $6.9 billion in the half. It was driven by the profit, but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we had favorable timing differences. When we look at the full year, we do expect that the $6.9 billion will come down. So what we achieved in the first half will come down because we do see negative cash flow in the second quarter, largely driven by the third quarter. And we'll come back to that in just a minute. But we think, largely, this is around the fact that our working capital and the favorable timing differences will reverse by the time we get to the end of the year.
I will note on this slide, we're taking our capital spending projection down. The guidance had been $7.7 billion. We're taking that down to $7 billion. It's largely around efficiencies on programs that are coming to a conclusion. And we're seeing we delivered them more efficiently, and also, lower non-product spending.
Okay, let's go to the balance sheet summary. This is a new slide we've developed just to capture all the balance sheet metrics. The only thing I'll say here is the Automotive balance sheet, very, very strong. Ford Credit continues to be well-capitalized and strong as well. And then, finally, in terms of pensions, we're still on track to have the pensions largely funded and derisked by the end of the year.
Okay. Now let's switch gears and let's talk more now about what lies ahead, not only in the second half, but for the full year. And we'll touch very briefly on 2017 and, of course, talk more about that at Investor Day in the middle of September. So what this slide basically says is compared with our prior expectations, our prior guidance, when you look at GDP, we now expect global U.S. and Europe GDP to be somewhat softer than what we had expected. Brazil and China, pretty much in line with what we've expected since the beginning of the year.
When we look at industry volume, we do think the global industry volume is likely to be a bit higher than what we had expected. That is driven by primarily China, but also Europe is doing a bit better than we had expected, at the high end of the range that we guided to earlier in the year. The softness is in the U.S. that is largely on the retail side of the business, and also in Brazil.
Now let's go on to 2 special attention slides that we provided to help you understand the second half and also our view of the full year. So the first thing I want to highlight is when you look at the far left, that's the $6.8 billion company profit in the first half, record results, fantastic. What is in there, though, is important to understand. A lot of the issues and risks that we will talk about for the full year, they were there in the first half. They started to appear in the first quarter and then the second quarter unfolded. 
We offset those risks with $1.6 billion of favorable cost performance versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So it wasn't an easy quarter or easy half. We had to work to get there. But the important message of this is that those risks flow into the second half. So for us to deliver the guidance that we're committed to deliver for the full year, we have to do that all over again. We're going to have to deliver stronger actions on costs. We're going to have to go back and look at the top line as well and find every dollar of revenue that we can get. That's what that next to last bar represents, the profit improvement actions. So we do that, and we're committed to doing that, then we're able to deliver the guidance, which again we're committed to do, and that's what the right-hand bar reflects.
What we're highlighting in between there with the red bars are the factors that are going to drive to a lower second half than is normal. Second half is normally lower. That's what the first red bar represents. But there's some other actions in there that I won't go through individually, other than I'll touch on Super Duty that will give us a lower second half than what would be normal. 
Super Duty is a very, very important product. It's high volume, and it's very high margin. It's a big change-over because we have not had a complete redesign of this product for 19, 20 years. It's going into a big plant. It's aluminum. It's a new frame. It's powertrain upgrades. It's new features. It's new technologies. So we really haven't touched a lot of this product for 19 years. So when we make this change, obviously, it's going to have an impact in the quarter from the launch effect and so forth, the cost. But even as we go through the quarter, we expect to have some impact because we do think we'll have lower contribution margins coming out of this than what we had going in. 
Still very high contribution margins, among the best in the portfolio. But the new product, which will be far superior than the one we have today and certainly, positioned the product to be a winner and the leader over the next decade and meet the regulatory requirements that we have to meet, there will be lower contribution margins when we come out of the launch. And that will flow through into the fourth quarter and the forward years. Now what will happen over time is we'll start to get the cost reductions, which we normally get, which is what benefited the older F-Series over the course of that 19-year cycle.
But it will also drive a weaker-than-normal third quarter, along with some of these other factors. So to put that into context, usually, the third quarter is about 1/4 of our full year results. It's likely to be half of that or lower, and that's largely around the F-Series effect. 
So let's go to the next slide. Some of those risks that we talked about that were in the first quarter largely -- or first half and that flowed through into the year as shown here. It's around higher Ford and industry incentives. We talked about that. They're up. We're up in line with that. The weakness or the softness in the U.S. retail industry. We see the second half actually being softer than the first half on an absolute basis. Again, that is -- it's retail. These are absolutely strong levels. They're just not as strong as what we had expected. And in fact, looking into '17, we think that we'll see further softness as the cycle matures. 
If you go down the page, Middle East and Africa, I've already talked about it, that's going to continue. The situation that we're facing, we are responding to that. In Asia Pacific, the higher -- the lower net pricing, the weaker exchange. We saw that. We're still dealing with it. And in Ford Credit, we have addressed the U.S. auction values, but it will give us a lower second half, in line with what we saw in the first half when we earned over $900 million.
The opportunity is Europe. We made a lot of money in Europe in the first half. Clearly have opportunity what we -- versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but we have to deal with Brexit, and we talked about that already. So we see these risks. We have seen them since the beginning of the year. We've been dealing with them very successfully. We will do so in the second half. But that is work that is still yet ahead of us.
And Mark will talk to that in his comments, which I'll turn over to him now."

But as we mentioned, we're facing risks to achieving that.
Now I'd like to talk about what we're going to do about it. And if you go to Slide 31, it shows you the improvement actions that we already have underway in the company. So to start, as we match production to demand and be very consistent around that, that will help reduce manufacturing costs. We've implemented an aggressive company-wide attack plan on costs. And as Bob mentioned, it builds on the considerable cost progress that we achieved in the first half of the year with that $1.6 billion in cost improvements that we delivered versus our plan. And as you can imagine, it looks at everything, from material cost to marketing and selling efficiencies, to freight and admin reductions.
Now at the same time, we have to put special attention on our go-to-market plans in the U.S. and China to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities. In addition, we're also utilizing our expanded data and analytics team to really pinpoint immediate areas of improvement in our market factors, including better volume and mix and pricing, which will in turn drive revenue.
And then, finally, we have a number of significant vehicle launches around the world this year. And we are challenging our team to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities as we launch those vehicles and take advantage of those launches. So we're aggressively executing on all these actions. And of course, we'll provide an update on our progress during our Investor Day on September 14. 
So in summary, and turning to Slide 32, again, I'd like to put the quarter in context for you. We had a strong second quarter, we had record cash flow and we had a record start to this year. And at the same time, we're seeing more pressure throughout the business for the remainder of the year. Now some of it, as we discussed, is expected, such as the launch of the Super Duty in North America. And some of it is not expected, such as the higher Ford and industry incentives in North America, a softening of the U.S. retail industry and uncertainty in Europe due to the Brexit effects.
So as a result, we're calling the second half of this year, and particularly the third quarter, to be much weaker than normal. Now I just want to caution you against using the second half of the year as an indicative run rate for 2017. It isn't. We expect 2017 to be another solid year for Ford despite the likely absence of growth in the U.S. industry volume and Brexit effects in Europe.
Now I think you know us very well. The Ford team remains committed to delivering our plan for this year, but we also have a long track record of calling risks as soon as we see them and acting decisively to deal with them. And that's exactly what we're doing today.
So with that, we'd love to take your questions."

Bob will take the first one on the industry sales. Here's how I think we'd characterize the market. If you recall, the -- vehicle sales for the industry grew at a really good pace in the early stages of the economic recovery. And if you recall, it actually outpaced the overall economic growth at the time. And so while the industry remains at fairly healthy levels, the competitive environment has intensified as that growth has moderated and as we've seen some of the softness in the retail demand. And in that environment, you've seen, as we've said, incentives creep up, and we've been about in line with that. But also, I think what it will result in probably for the remainder of this year, Brian, is a fairly volatile kind of SAAR factor from month-to-month because that will be influenced by any particular OEM or brand that wants to increase their incentives to maybe juice their market share or whatever. As we get in -- so the bottom line is we expect in the second half of this year that the retail industry to be lower than the year ago. As we get into 2017, obviously, we'll talk more about that in the future, but as Bob mentioned, we do expect the industry to be probably slightly down in 2017."

And Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I'd go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at higher levels of inventory as we were",351,"Okay. And Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I'd go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at higher levels of inventory as we were -- particularly in the early part of the year because of 2 factors: one, we had to prepare for the Super Duty launch, which we touched on; and also, because of the fact that many of our plants are running at 3 crew. And so as a result, there will be periods where it's low absolute volume months, where the inventory will be -- from a day's supply level, high, but it's to support the higher volume months of the year, particularly in the spring and the end of the year into the summer and so forth. So we're comfortable with the levels that we've been at. The thing that's kind of interesting in terms of responding to the softness -- it's not been around incentives, it's been making production adjustments. Because if you look in the first half at -- I mean, you wouldn't see this, but I'm telling you this, if you looked at the wholesales that we had planned, they are higher or were higher than what we actually delivered. Because even as we saw some of the softness that we've talked about occur in the first half of the year, Joe Hinrichs and the team are making production adjustments along the way. So we ended up with lower wholesales in the half than what we had expected. I mean, that's how we primarily deal with that. It's just adjusting production to demand. That's what we'll do in the second half, which what Mark talked about in his comments. So the incentives, I think, are different. The incentives are really sort of an environmental issue, if you will, across the industry. And then for us, I think there's a piece of what I'd talked about earlier around the normalization in this period versus a year ago of F-150."

There's no question about that because the second half will be lower. They usually are lower in the second half. This will be a weaker than normal second half. So that is what it's going to happen. I would just go back to '14. If you think about '14, North America had lower margins than it had been running at because of the launch of F-150, and then they bounced back up in 2015, particularly the second half, and then early this year. So what we're seeing is a really big launch. It's not going to take much as volume out as those launches did because we've learned so much from them. But it's a really big launch, and it's going to have an effect. It's really around all these other issues and the softening of the industry and the higher incentives. Those are the things that we're working on. And I would actually call them sort of early signs of the maturation of the cycle. The structure that we put in place in North America was designed to give us good results and good performance when things get tough, and it is getting a little bit tougher. That's what we're seeing, but I think the structure of the business is good. And oh, by the way, remember that $1.6 billion of cost performance we talked about, a lot of that was delivered in North America. So we're keeping it up, if you will, in terms of the structure of the business with what we're seeing happen. So I think we're good shape in terms of the robustness of their structure and prepared for that eventual downturn."

We've had great performance on a year-over-year basis in the first half. Some of that is because it was a relatively quiet product period for us, if you will, overall, globally, but when we get into the second half, we have Super Duty. We've got the Continental. We have some of the launches in North America that will take place in China. But very importantly, and we'll talk more about this when we get to Investor Day. That was one of the bars on that waterfall chart, which was around product investment. We have been seeing an increase in product investment from Ford over the last number of years actually. As we got bigger, we expanded the portfolio, invested more in technologies. We went into new markets. We added capacity, particularly in emerging markets. Going forward, we're going to be completely replacing the C-platform. We're going to be completely replacing the C/D platform. We are investing heavily in electrification. Adam's point around autonomous vehicles, that's underway as we speak. There's regulatory requirements that we have to meet, which bring with it added investment as well. So you will see an increase in both capital spending and engineering, and you see some of that even in the second half relative to the first half because what we're showing you is an increase that's higher-than-normal. Normally, we see that happen. It's even higher-than-normal. And as we go into next year, that will be a factor. So you will see higher cost overall in the year versus a year ago that will largely occur in the second half of the year. But we don't expect to be down by the time we get into the end of the year.

So I think we need to put in context what's happening. I think we're in transition. If you go back and think about what's happened since 2009, the industry has grown way in excess of GDP over that period of time, and so we've all benefited from very, very robust growth of the industry. It is now plateauing. And I think the industry and all the players in the industry, we have to kind of pivot. We have to transition, and I think that's what's occurring. And the reason I'm encouraged by the -- encouraged to think that, that will occur successfully is the fact that, not only us, but everyone, all the big players are very, very focused on margins. They know that's important. They know that's what counts. They're focused on that. And I really believe that, ultimately, that will be the driver of decisions around how aggressively people go after a pie that isn't growing frankly anymore. The other thing that's probably different than it's been over the last 2 or 3 years is the yen. The yen has started to shrink in -- from the levels it had reached. I think it got to about a 120 level. It's been 100, 103, 105. I mean, that certainly puts some constraints on the Japanese participants in the market in terms of maybe some of the benefits and the windfalls of the weaker yen that they were deploying that just isn't there anymore. So I think it'll probably take some time, but I think that the discipline that we've seen will stick, and we'll get used to the new environment."

I think with a -- at a SAAR at that level, and I couch that because the official Chinese numbers coming out from the government are not available.

But first of all, we'll get out of some of the one-time unique issues that we saw in the second half and maybe to some extent, in the first half. But you'll also see, I think it does appear in these articles that are being written that the emerging market downturn, perhaps, globally is beginning to bottom out. I talked about the fact that Russia's already improving in terms of our own portfolio. There's a question earlier around South America. Our view, early view anyway, is that there could be very, very, very small levels of growth there next year, nothing to write home about, but it would be great to see a positive number with no brackets around it. And so that would be, perhaps, the beginning of the turn there and decline of the increased losses. So that's going to help. We're going to have, again, as we always do, a lot of product launches. And I think, going back to the earlier question around the portfolio, we really are focusing our investments very specifically to where we can make money. And I think that will be a phenomenon that will be even in sharper focus, going ahead, and I think that will benefit, for example, the Ford new SUVs that we've talked about globally. I mean those are the sweet spot of where our consumers are going. Those are higher margin products. That will start to help us as we move ahead, and the cost, I mean, we're going to really be -- we will see cost increases, I'll call them, that are healthy, to support the growing business, and certainly, to be a leader in all these emerging opportunities ahead. But other than that, we are going to be, as we have been, very focused on efficiencies and driving nonessential costs out of the business. We did that very successfully in the first half. We need to do that in the second and we're going to do that going forward as well."

Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of",661,"All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on Slide 3. So what I'd like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of our best second quarters ever. And while pretax profits are down compared with last year's record second quarter, revenue was up 6%, so we grew the top line. 
Global market share declined outside of North America, but share was up in the U.S. and Canada. Our Automotive operating cash flow was an all-time quarterly record. Europe's pretax profit almost tripled from last year. And North America and Ford Credit remained strong. Now combined with our first quarter record, we achieved record first half pretax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America.
Now we continue to expect another strong year, and we're committed to our full year guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year. But at the same time, we now see a number of risks that the entire Ford team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance. And we'll explain more as we go through the information this morning.
Now turning to Slide 4. We remain absolutely focused on the 4 drivers of shareholder value, and I'm pleased to say we made progress on each. As I mentioned, we grew our top line, and we announced actions to continue to grow our core business, including new global SUVs and also positive sales momentum at Lincoln. We also continued to pursue emerging opportunities, such as our investment in Pivotal, which will further strengthen our cloud-based software capabilities. 
Our returns were strong, as I just reviewed. Now in terms of risk, we received a rating upgrade by Fitch. Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter. And we achieved $1.6 billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million to our shareholders.
Now Slide 5 shows some of the other highlights in the quarter, and I won't go through each of these. But as you can see, they span everything from awards for our new products and engines, to progress in our quality efforts, to the launches of products and connected services. But I will just point out in quality, the J.D. Power IQS survey, Lincoln came in at #7 and Ford came in at #11, both improved and really puts an exclamation point on the efforts that our team has around continuously improving our quality for our customers.
Now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and how we see it on Slide 6. At the macro level, we're seeing higher levels of economic uncertainty. Financial markets and the sterling and euro are affected by Brexit. And global interest rates have been reverting to recent lows. Now U.S. growth is improving after a weak start that we saw at the beginning of the year, but we are seeing signs of a maturing U.S. recovery. We do expect continued growth in China, albeit that's supported by government stimulus measures. But we're also seeing increased pressures on margins. And while conditions in Brazil remain difficult, Russia is actually showing some signs of stabilization. 
Now for Ford, specifically, our risks are around lower pricing and higher incentives than we expected in the U.S. and China; a softer, although still strong, U.S. retail industry; the effects of Brexit on our operations in Europe; a more difficult external environment across many of our markets in Middle East and Africa; a weaker Chinese RMB; and lower-than-expected auction values for smaller vehicles leased in the U.S. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back at the end and cover our outlook. Bob?"

We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is",1490,"Okay. Thank you, Mark. We'll start on Slide 8, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is the third column. 
So as Mark said, it was a strong quarter for us. And to demonstrate that, if we look at the company adjusted pretax results, you can see $3 billion, which was down 9% from a year ago. But it was, as Mark said, one of the strongest second quarters that we've had. If you go down further to net income attributable to Ford at $2 billion. That was also down 9% and adjusted earnings per share down 4%. 
If you go to the bottom of the chart, you can see the liquidity metrics. I'll come back to those later, so I won't go through them individually at this point, but you can see they were very, very strong. If you look at the year-to-date column, let's hit the same lines on the chart. Our company adjusted pretax results at $6.8 billion. Remember, we had the best ever first quarter. So when we combine that with the strong second quarter, we ended up with a record for the first half $6.8 billion, that was up 35%. And net income of $4.4 billion, that was up 33%. And then the adjusted earnings per share for the first half at $1.20, up 45%.
Let's go on to the next slide, Slide 9. And here, what I want to focus on are the absolutes before we get into some of the details within both the Automotive segment and Ford Credit. Looking at the Automotive segment, you can see the strong result at North America at $2.7 billion. It was down about 5%. Europe was clearly a highlight among all the business units in the quarter. It was up 3x from where we were last year, the best second quarter result ever. And that included some impact from Brexit, which I'll talk about in just a minute. But really, a great result in Europe. 
And if you look at the Financial Services, that includes a $400 million profit from Ford Credit. It was down, and I'll explain what was behind that. If you look at the other business units, they were all in losses. South America, $265 million, down a bit. Middle East and Africa, down also at a $65 million loss. And then we had our first loss in Asia Pacific in 13 quarters at $8 million, and that decline was driven largely by China, and we'll talk about that later in the presentation as well. I will highlight here All Other. That's one of our new segments. That is primarily, in this quarter, net interest expense.
Okay, let's go on to Slide 10. And as usual, we'll look at the key metrics for the Automotive sector. Very strong absolutes across the board, but when you look at the comparisons versus last year, some mixed results. Wholesale is flat. Revenue, up 5%. Market share, Mark explained that, it was down everywhere but in North America. And the operating margin was a strong 7.7% and the result at $2.8 billion. And then if you look at the very bottom of the page, we've provided you with the same metrics and the year-over-year changes for the first half. And you can see very strong performance right across the board, with the exception of market share where we were down just a touch. 
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 11, and we'll start breaking the Automotive segment down. This is a view of what happened on a year-over-year basis that resulted in a decline of $130 million. So when you look at it overall, you can see that the market factors, which is volume/mix and net pricing, was down. And that was driven by higher incentives, and that was mainly in the U.S. We will talk about that when we get to the North American slides. You can see exchange was an issue at $269 million. We did have some favorable cost performance, and that was largely driven by commodities. And then in Other to the far right, that was largely the gain on sale of an equity investment. I'll touch on it a bit when we get to North America.
Okay, let's go into North America on Slide 12 and look at the key metrics. Again, very strong quarter for North America. The top line was essentially flat to very slightly up in the case of revenue. Market share, flat. But as was already mentioned, within that, the U.S. was up, and that was higher fleet performance, but also, we had very strong retail share improvement for F-Series. Canada was up, Mexico was down. That's how we ended up with a sort of flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at margin, 11.3%. That was down 0.9%. But obviously, it is over 11%, that's an outstanding level of efficiency in performance for the North American operations, and then $2.7 billion. If you look down at the bottom of the slide, really strong results in the first half, best ever for North America. We had very strong growth. We grew the share 12.1% margin and $5.8 billion in profit, up 31%. So really strong performance in the first half for North America.
All right. Let's go to the next slide and look at what happened in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, here, the story is largely around incentives. If you look at the market factors, you can see that they were down on a net basis, driven by the incentives. And essentially, what we're seeing is over time, and particularly as the U.S. industry has started to plateau and we're starting to get to a more mature part of the economic cycle in the U.S., we've seen sort of a very gradual rising, very modestly rising level of incentives for the industry, and we have been increasing along with that.
Now what you also have happening on a year-over-year basis, which is maybe a little bit unique to us, is the fact that a year ago, we had very low incentives for the F-150. If you remember, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City. I think it was around May when we got to full production. So we had very tight incentives, very high ATPs on F-150. We've become more normal, if you will. We're still in a good position relative to our peer set within the -- particularly our domestic peers in terms of ATPs for F-150 as well as incentives. But there was a factor of that in our incentives [ph] as well. But there's no question that we've seen an increase, and that is more than what we had expected when we developed our plan at the beginning of the year. 
When you look at costs, we were favorable on costs overall. That was again driven by incentives. Most of the good news -- or rather, commodities. Most of the good news on commodities in the company occurred in North America. 
And then to the far right, you can see the good news from that equity sale, which was the OEConnection sale that occurred in the quarter, and that benefited North America. 
Before we leave this slide, I just want to go back to mix. Mix is a very important part of the story across many of the business units. But certainly, North America was one of the stronger stories. That's product mix. In the case of North America, when I get to Europe, you're going to see the same thing along with good news on series mix and options. A very important part of what's happening as we're seeing sort of the car recession. But this has actually been part of our strategy, to focus on higher-margin, more profitable vehicles, but also where the consumers are going. 
The other thing I would just note on this slide is that we have picked up in warranty cost, you can see that in the callout box, the Takata recall. That was about $100 million. And I just want to just digress for just a moment to say our approach inside Ford is unfortunately, recalls are a normal part of business. So we do not put recalls in special items or exclude them from margins or exclude them from operating results, as some of our other competitors do. It is, again, unfortunately, a normal part of business. We will report them in operating results. We always have. We always will. And if there's something of consequence that occurs, we'll just call it out, and you can make your own judgments in terms of whether that's a run rate or not. But certainly, they're lumpy."

And this has resulted in higher industry incentives with -- if you look at the retail industry sales rate, it's actually declined 3 out of the last 4 months. So the bottom line is that we've seen a tougher pricing environment this quarter, and we will face one going forward. And as Bob mentioned, with the car segment the most impacted as various competitors look to protect their share."

External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a d",697,"Okay. Let's move on to Slide 14, and we'll talk about South America. In South America, this is a story that is very much what it's been the last number of quarters. External conditions, particularly in Brazil, continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a decline in the top line, you can see double digits. In the case of revenue, you can see it was down 17%. That decline is entirely due to the weaker currencies.
Market share was down as we focused on the most profitable parts of our portfolio amid increasing discounts across the industry. And then you can see the results in terms of margin and pretax results. This is largely what you're also seeing in the first half. I will say that the team has done a -- continues to do a good job of focusing on the things that it can manage, particularly on cost.
And if you go to the next slide, on Slide 15, you can see the results of that. We once again delivered very strong cost performance. So if you think about last year, we delivered over $400 million of good news on cost performance, we had good news in the first quarter, another good tranche of performance here in the second quarter. But as you can see, just to the left of that, we continued to see difficulties in pricing, enough to be able to offset the effects of high local inflation and the weaker local currencies. 
Industry, still an issue, as you can see in the volume and mix. And then the balance sheet actually helped us this time. This was the strengthening of the Argentinian peso. We are seeing good things in Argentina as the new government is really getting traction in terms of turning that economy in the better direction. And so that gave us some good news in the quarter.
Okay. Let's go on to Europe, which, as I mentioned earlier, was a bright spot for us. If you look at the wholesales and the revenue, up double digits. Share actually declined a little bit. That was market mix. The Southern European markets grew, if you will, disproportionately. Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe, and so that affected us. 
Margin was 5.8%, which is very, very good performance, and the profit that I had touched on earlier. And then if you look at the first half, we made $900 million in the quarter, a margin of 6%. And you can see very strong growth at the top line as well, and share was flat. So this was a really great story. 
The other thing I want to highlight, we're committed to Russia. We stayed in Russia. We've been working to make sure that we're responding to the environment in Russia, and it's paying off. Within the good news that we saw in the quarter, Russia was actually a good part of that.
And on that note, let's turn to the year-over-year on Slide 17. And you can see the improvement of $300 million. It was market performance. It was a favorable cost performance. And then in the case of exchange, this is the first time that you'll see us talking about Brexit. We had bad news of about $60 million on the balance sheet related to the weak sterling. And one of the things that's important to note is that our strategy on hedging for the company is to go into a year with certain of our key currencies completely hedged from an operational exposure point of view. So we came into the year with the sterling and the euro completely hedged. So we don't see any issues relative to the weakness of the sterling on an operating basis for the balance of the year. We have about 60% of next year's exposure already covered, and there's a little bit that's also covered all the way out into 2018.
When we talk about the Brexit effect later, you have to remember the $60 million because there is an impact in the second half that we'll talk about that's related to a weaker industry."

And that includes, as you can imagine, looking at consumer confidence levels amongst other indicators. And if you reflect, the industry back in the first quarter in the U.K. was at a record. But we saw that growth starting to decline in the second quarter ahead of the Brexit. And so far, as we look at July, by our reckoning, the industry is actually up in the U.K.; but on a retail basis, it's down. So as we look going forward, the industry could be down 5% to 10% for the rest of the year, depending upon which outside forecast you look at. But even within that, we'll continue to work to deliver consistent market performance, including obviously continuing our strong growth in commercial vehicles."

But we are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit. It's a $60 million with another $140 million, $150 million related to a weaker U.K. industry. When you get into '17 and '18, we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of $400 million to $500 million in each year. And that is related again to weak industry or weaker industry in the U.K. And then, also, you start to pick up a little bit of bad news on exchange because of the fact that the hedging is only 60% in place for next year and less than that in 2018. So that's what we're looking at. We're not going beyond that in terms of what happens once they actually leave because there's just too much uncertainty, particularly around what will happen with tariff barriers.
Okay. All right. Let's go on, and we'll talk about the Middle East and Africa on Slide 18. I mean, this is a story of just a bad business environment. If anything can go wrong, it seems like it has. It's low oil. It's weak currencies. There's political strife. In South Africa, we've seen labor disruptions. I mean, it's just, you name it, it's happening. And the result has been really weak industries. I mean, we're seeing declines of 30%, 40% in some of our markets. In some of the countries, access to currency and so forth, it's pretty difficult. But you can see the effect of that has only been a modest increase in the loss. The team has actually done a great job of working on the costs it can control because it does import most of the vehicles that it sells from other business units. But they've actually done a great job on costs, and they've done a good job on pricing. 
And if you look at the market share, while it looks like it's down and, in fact, it is, that is driven by the growth of the Iranian industry, which we don't participate in. The overall region is down 300,000 units; within that, Iran is up 300. So if we take Iran out, the team has actually increased our share by 0.6 point. So they're really doing a great job on share, on costs. But the headwinds across the region are just so large that we're kind of swimming in place at the moment.
Okay, let's go on to Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is an interesting story. We saw a decline in wholesales. Some of that was expected because we did have a planned 8-week shutdown of our Chongqing #1 assembly plant. That was for a complete overhaul of the paint booth there. So that was expected. But frankly, there were performance issues at Ford as well. There were also issues in terms of industry segmentation that we'll touch on. 
If you look at revenue, revenue was up 17%. We did see a decline in market share, that was China. And if you look at the margins, obviously, we were just below breakeven in margins and pretax results; and as I mentioned earlier, the first loss we've had in quite a number of quarters. And if you look at the year-to-date results, we've seen the top line grow share as well. But again, our operating margin and pretax results down from a year ago. 
I would highlight in the far right of this slide, our China joint ventures, on an equity after-tax basis, contributed about $300 million of profit. That was down about 28%. We still have very healthy margins there at 16.1%. I think that was down about 1.2 points from where we were this time a year ago. 
What we have on Slide 20 is a bit of what happened in terms of market share in China in the period, which really drove what happened in the region. So if you look at the far left, last year, we did 5.3%. China, we're down about 0.9 point. And you can see the factors that drove that. Half of it was basically external. Industry mix, what that means, the mix of the industry was stronger on passenger vehicles, it was weaker on commercial vehicles. We have joint ventures that participate, 2 different ones that participate in each one of those.
The segmentation issue is that within commercial vehicles, it was down, but it was actually up in the very low margin, mini-commercial segment, which we don't participate in. So if you think about the part we participate in, it was even lower. And so that was the effect that it had on our share from both those -- the industry mix change and then the segmentation within commercial vehicles. 
And then on performance, we were off 0.4 point, and that was largely around weakness in the C segment and the small utilities, where we're seeing a lot of competition from the domestics that are really coming up strongly and with really better products. And so it was a difficult situation for us. 
We also had some go-to-market strategies, frankly. And the team immediately saw these issues there. They actually started to occur in March. Immediate action was taken to address these issues. And you can see, looking at the share in April, May and June, we started to get back on track. And we feel like the second half of the year is going to be better for us and supported, in part, by a number of new product launches that are important that will help us."

So as Bob mentioned, we've taken actions to improve our market performance. And we have a number of important launches, the Taurus with the 1.5-liter engine. It will be the only large car eligible for the purchase tax incentive. The new Cougar, the new Mondeo, the Lincoln MKZ and Continental. And the majority of these launches will benefit us in the fourth quarter, not so much the third quarter."

Let's go to Slide 21, and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I'm going to explain what you can see. I'm going to explain to you what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about. So you can see m",2446,"Okay. Let's go to Slide 21, and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I'm going to explain what you can see. I'm going to explain to you what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about. So you can see market factors were slightly negative, both pricing and then you can see volume/mix pretty flat. Within that, there actually was a quite good news on mix. So with that mix and other, it was more like around $60 million, $70 million of favorable mix, and that's along the lines of what Mark talked about. 
When you look at the cost performance, it was up. We expected it to be up. It actually isn't up as much as what we had expected. And then exchange, this is a story of a weaker renminbi. As Brexit has occurred and it affected the sterling and the euro, the Chinese are now kind of targeting their currency against a basket of currencies, not just the dollar. As those weakened, we saw the Chinese start to push down the renminbi and the response to that, and that had an effect on us. 
What we had expected to see in the quarter, we didn't expect the loss, obviously, was the fact that we'd have stronger market factors. The net pricing in China has been worse than what we thought. We thought 5% to 6%. Actually, year-to-date, it's approaching 7% or high 6s. We're at about 7% or so. We think this will mitigate in the balance of the year because if you look at last year, the decline was largely sort of from this point through the rest of the year. So we think it will mitigate, and we'll end up at the high end of that range.
And when you look at the volume and mix, that was the share issue that we talked about. So team's all over it. We're working on it. But that's really what happened to us in Asia Pacific in the quarter.
Let's go on to Slide 22, and we'll turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit grew, that's the first 2 metrics, double digits, and that was really around the world. If you look at the pretax results, the $400 million, that was down 21%. I'll show you why in just a minute. If you look at sort of the portfolio performance, very healthy FICO scores, in a good place; delinquencies up a bit, although I'll say something about that in just a minute in terms of credit losses. And the loss receivables, up 15 basis points, actually about where it's been the last 2 or 3 quarters. It's just up a bit from the last 2 or 3, up more from a year ago. And starting to approach what the level of LTR that we saw before the Great Recession. So this is just getting back to sort of normal levels. It's not an issue per se. 
All right, let's go on to the next slide and look at the year-over-year. So the decline was largely around lease residuals and credit losses. In terms of lease residuals, it's really 2 things, and it's in the callout box. If you look at the residual gains and losses, you can see on a year-over-year basis the declines. So these are vehicles that come back. Do we lose money or do we gain money? We actually gained money on the returned vehicles in the quarter. We just didn't gain as much as we did a year ago. So that's how we ended up with the negative number.
And then in terms of supplemental depreciation, this is a reflection of lower auction values and a projection of lower lease-in values, particularly for smaller vehicles. We have adjusted our depreciation glide path to those new lower end points, and that's what's reflected there. 
When you look at the credit losses, this is largely around a couple of things. You can see the charge-offs. Those are the vehicles that we actually repossessed and then we took back to market and resold. And you can see there was a decline there of $34 million, and then we had to increase the reserve by $31 million. 
But the thing I wanted to mention on this is a number of things going on in here. But while the delinquencies are up a little bit, what we're seeing happen is that the number of people who actually default once they are delinquent, if you will, is increasing versus where it has been. It's not a level that's of concern. It's actually just coming back again to a level that's more normal. I think there've been a number of articles from banks and others around that, but that's one of the factors. The other thing is that the severities -- so when we do take them back to the auction market, the severities are greater, in part, because of what I mentioned in terms of the lease-in values of the vehicles are lower overall. But also, because of the longer terms, people are -- the portfolio of people are turning their vehicles a bit earlier and so the severities are greater. Because of all of those factors, we also have had to increase the reserve in addition to the fact that business is just bigger. And so we have to increase the reserve in line with just the larger business. 
Okay, let's go to the next slide, and this is looking at trends. I'm just going to talk to the 2 on the right. I think I've already covered the 2 -- 2 on the left, the 2 on the right I've covered. We said in the first quarter that our lease penetration would decline, it did by 3 points in the second quarter. We think, again, for the full year, it will be lower than it was in the first quarter. And you can see that we dropped a bit more than what the overall industry did.
And in the lower left, this is around what we talked about, the auction values. This is a constant mix. So it's mix the same as the second quarter. You can see that we are pretty flat in terms of values in the second quarter compared to the first, but down from where we were a year ago, and that's largely around the smaller vehicles. 
Okay. Let's turn now to cash flow. Cash flow, a very, very good story for us in the quarter. It was the best ever in the quarter and the half, $4.2 billion operating in the quarter, $6.9 billion in the half. It was driven by the profit, but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we had favorable timing differences. When we look at the full year, we do expect that the $6.9 billion will come down. So what we achieved in the first half will come down because we do see negative cash flow in the second quarter, largely driven by the third quarter. And we'll come back to that in just a minute. But we think, largely, this is around the fact that our working capital and the favorable timing differences will reverse by the time we get to the end of the year.
I will note on this slide, we're taking our capital spending projection down. The guidance had been $7.7 billion. We're taking that down to $7 billion. It's largely around efficiencies on programs that are coming to a conclusion. And we're seeing we delivered them more efficiently, and also, lower non-product spending.
Okay, let's go to the balance sheet summary. This is a new slide we've developed just to capture all the balance sheet metrics. The only thing I'll say here is the Automotive balance sheet, very, very strong. Ford Credit continues to be well-capitalized and strong as well. And then, finally, in terms of pensions, we're still on track to have the pensions largely funded and derisked by the end of the year.
Okay. Now let's switch gears and let's talk more now about what lies ahead, not only in the second half, but for the full year. And we'll touch very briefly on 2017 and, of course, talk more about that at Investor Day in the middle of September. So what this slide basically says is compared with our prior expectations, our prior guidance, when you look at GDP, we now expect global U.S. and Europe GDP to be somewhat softer than what we had expected. Brazil and China, pretty much in line with what we've expected since the beginning of the year.
When we look at industry volume, we do think the global industry volume is likely to be a bit higher than what we had expected. That is driven by primarily China, but also Europe is doing a bit better than we had expected, at the high end of the range that we guided to earlier in the year. The softness is in the U.S. that is largely on the retail side of the business, and also in Brazil.
Now let's go on to 2 special attention slides that we provided to help you understand the second half and also our view of the full year. So the first thing I want to highlight is when you look at the far left, that's the $6.8 billion company profit in the first half, record results, fantastic. What is in there, though, is important to understand. A lot of the issues and risks that we will talk about for the full year, they were there in the first half. They started to appear in the first quarter and then the second quarter unfolded. 
We offset those risks with $1.6 billion of favorable cost performance versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So it wasn't an easy quarter or easy half. We had to work to get there. But the important message of this is that those risks flow into the second half. So for us to deliver the guidance that we're committed to deliver for the full year, we have to do that all over again. We're going to have to deliver stronger actions on costs. We're going to have to go back and look at the top line as well and find every dollar of revenue that we can get. That's what that next to last bar represents, the profit improvement actions. So we do that, and we're committed to doing that, then we're able to deliver the guidance, which again we're committed to do, and that's what the right-hand bar reflects.
What we're highlighting in between there with the red bars are the factors that are going to drive to a lower second half than is normal. Second half is normally lower. That's what the first red bar represents. But there's some other actions in there that I won't go through individually, other than I'll touch on Super Duty that will give us a lower second half than what would be normal. 
Super Duty is a very, very important product. It's high volume, and it's very high margin. It's a big change-over because we have not had a complete redesign of this product for 19, 20 years. It's going into a big plant. It's aluminum. It's a new frame. It's powertrain upgrades. It's new features. It's new technologies. So we really haven't touched a lot of this product for 19 years. So when we make this change, obviously, it's going to have an impact in the quarter from the launch effect and so forth, the cost. But even as we go through the quarter, we expect to have some impact because we do think we'll have lower contribution margins coming out of this than what we had going in. 
Still very high contribution margins, among the best in the portfolio. But the new product, which will be far superior than the one we have today and certainly, positioned the product to be a winner and the leader over the next decade and meet the regulatory requirements that we have to meet, there will be lower contribution margins when we come out of the launch. And that will flow through into the fourth quarter and the forward years. Now what will happen over time is we'll start to get the cost reductions, which we normally get, which is what benefited the older F-Series over the course of that 19-year cycle.
But it will also drive a weaker-than-normal third quarter, along with some of these other factors. So to put that into context, usually, the third quarter is about 1/4 of our full year results. It's likely to be half of that or lower, and that's largely around the F-Series effect. 
So let's go to the next slide. Some of those risks that we talked about that were in the first quarter largely -- or first half and that flowed through into the year as shown here. It's around higher Ford and industry incentives. We talked about that. They're up. We're up in line with that. The weakness or the softness in the U.S. retail industry. We see the second half actually being softer than the first half on an absolute basis. Again, that is -- it's retail. These are absolutely strong levels. They're just not as strong as what we had expected. And in fact, looking into '17, we think that we'll see further softness as the cycle matures. 
If you go down the page, Middle East and Africa, I've already talked about it, that's going to continue. The situation that we're facing, we are responding to that. In Asia Pacific, the higher -- the lower net pricing, the weaker exchange. We saw that. We're still dealing with it. And in Ford Credit, we have addressed the U.S. auction values, but it will give us a lower second half, in line with what we saw in the first half when we earned over $900 million.
The opportunity is Europe. We made a lot of money in Europe in the first half. Clearly have opportunity what we -- versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but we have to deal with Brexit, and we talked about that already. So we see these risks. We have seen them since the beginning of the year. We've been dealing with them very successfully. We will do so in the second half. But that is work that is still yet ahead of us.

So as you can see on Slide 30, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance. But as we mentioned, we're facing risks to achieving that.Now I'd like to talk about what we're going to do about it. And if you go to Slide 31, it shows you th",521,"Great. Thanks, Bob. So as you can see on Slide 30, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance. But as we mentioned, we're facing risks to achieving that.
Now I'd like to talk about what we're going to do about it. And if you go to Slide 31, it shows you the improvement actions that we already have underway in the company. So to start, as we match production to demand and be very consistent around that, that will help reduce manufacturing costs. We've implemented an aggressive company-wide attack plan on costs. And as Bob mentioned, it builds on the considerable cost progress that we achieved in the first half of the year with that $1.6 billion in cost improvements that we delivered versus our plan. And as you can imagine, it looks at everything, from material cost to marketing and selling efficiencies, to freight and admin reductions.
Now at the same time, we have to put special attention on our go-to-market plans in the U.S. and China to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities. In addition, we're also utilizing our expanded data and analytics team to really pinpoint immediate areas of improvement in our market factors, including better volume and mix and pricing, which will in turn drive revenue.
And then, finally, we have a number of significant vehicle launches around the world this year. And we are challenging our team to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities as we launch those vehicles and take advantage of those launches. So we're aggressively executing on all these actions. And of course, we'll provide an update on our progress during our Investor Day on September 14. 
So in summary, and turning to Slide 32, again, I'd like to put the quarter in context for you. We had a strong second quarter, we had record cash flow and we had a record start to this year. And at the same time, we're seeing more pressure throughout the business for the remainder of the year. Now some of it, as we discussed, is expected, such as the launch of the Super Duty in North America. And some of it is not expected, such as the higher Ford and industry incentives in North America, a softening of the U.S. retail industry and uncertainty in Europe due to the Brexit effects.
So as a result, we're calling the second half of this year, and particularly the third quarter, to be much weaker than normal. Now I just want to caution you against using the second half of the year as an indicative run rate for 2017. It isn't. We expect 2017 to be another solid year for Ford despite the likely absence of growth in the U.S. industry volume and Brexit effects in Europe.
Now I think you know us very well. The Ford team remains committed to delivering our plan for this year, but we also have a long track record of calling risks as soon as we see them and acting decisively to deal with them. And that's exactly what we're doing today.
So with that, we'd love to take your questions."

First, we talked about the inventory situation at the end of 1Q. Certainly [ph], we tracked how it's developing during 2Q. And even backing out Super Duty safety stocks, it looked like, coming into the quarter, there was a fair amount of inventory. How much of the incentive activity has been related to working that down and perhaps versus sort of broader trends? And then, what's your thinking on the trajectory of industry sales, particularly retail sales through the second half and into 2017?"

Bob will take the first one on the industry sales. Here's how I think we'd characterize the market. If you recall, the -- vehicle sales for the industry grew at a really good pace in the early stages of the economic recovery. And if you recall, it actually outpaced the overall economic growth at the time. And so while the industry remains at fairly healthy levels, the competitive environment has intensified as that growth has moderated and as we've seen some of the softness in the retail demand. And in that environment, you've seen, as we've said, incentives creep up, and we've been about in line with that. But also, I think what it will result in probably for the remainder of this year, Brian, is a fairly volatile kind of SAAR factor from month-to-month because that will be influenced by any particular OEM or brand that wants to increase their incentives to maybe juice their market share or whatever. As we get in -- so the bottom line is we expect in the second half of this year that the retail industry to be lower than the year ago. As we get into 2017, obviously, we'll talk more about that in the future, but as Bob mentioned, we do expect the industry to be probably slightly down in 2017."

And Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I'd go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March.

And Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I'd go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at higher levels of inventory as we were -- particularly in the early part of the year because of 2 factors: one, we had to prepare for the Super Duty launch, which we touched on; and also, because of the fact that many of our plants are running at 3 crew. And so as a result, there will be periods where it's low absolute volume months, where the inventory will be -- from a day's supply level, high, but it's to support the higher volume months of the year, particularly in the spring and the end of the year into the summer and so forth. So we're comfortable with the levels that we've been at. The thing that's kind of interesting in terms of responding to the softness -- it's not been around incentives, it's been making production adjustments. Because if you look in the first half at -- I mean, you wouldn't see this, but I'm telling you this, if you looked at the wholesales that we had planned, they are higher or were higher than what we actually delivered. Because even as we saw some of the softness that we've talked about occur in the first half of the year, Joe Hinrichs and the team are making production adjustments along the way. So we ended up with lower wholesales in the half than what we had expected. I mean, that's how we primarily deal with that. It's just adjusting production to demand. That's what we'll do in the second half, which what Mark talked about in his comments. So the incentives, I think, are different. The incentives are really sort of an environmental issue, if you will, across the industry. And then for us, I think there's a piece of what I'd talked about earlier around the normalization in this period versus a year ago of F-150."

There's no question about that because the second half will be lower. They usually are lower in the second half. This will be a weaker than normal second half. So that is what it's going to happen. I would just go back to '14. If you think about '14, North America had lower margins than it had been running at because of the launch of F-150, and then they bounced back up in 2015, particularly the second half, and then early this year. So what we're seeing is a really big launch. It's not going to take much as volume out as those launches did because we've learned so much from them. But it's a really big launch, and it's going to have an effect. It's really around all these other issues and the softening of the industry and the higher incentives. Those are the things that we're working on. And I would actually call them sort of early signs of the maturation of the cycle. The structure that we put in place in North America was designed to give us good results and good performance when things get tough, and it is getting a little bit tougher. That's what we're seeing, but I think the structure of the business is good. And oh, by the way, remember that $1.6 billion of cost performance we talked about, a lot of that was delivered in North America. So we're keeping it up, if you will, in terms of the structure of the business with what we're seeing happen.

But to your question, Colin, what you will see overall, particularly, in the second half, you'll see a bigger-than-normal cost increase, and that will also be something that you'll see for the full year. We've had great performance on a year-over-year basis in the first half. Some of that is because it was a relatively quiet product period for us, if you will, overall, globally, but when we get into the second half, we have Super Duty. We've got the Continental. We have some of the launches in North America that will take place in China. But very importantly, and we'll talk more about this when we get to Investor Day. That was one of the bars on that waterfall chart, which was around product investment. We have been seeing an increase in product investment from Ford over the last number of years actually. As we got bigger, we expanded the portfolio, invested more in technologies. We went into new markets. We added capacity, particularly in emerging markets. Going forward, we're going to be completely replacing the C-platform. We're going to be completely replacing the C/D platform. We are investing heavily in electrification. Adam's point around autonomous vehicles, that's underway as we speak. There's regulatory requirements that we have to meet, which bring with it added investment as well. So you will see an increase in both capital spending and engineering, and you see some of that even in the second half relative to the first half because what we're showing you is an increase that's higher-than-normal. Normally, we see that happen. It's even higher-than-normal. And as we go into next year, that will be a factor.

And then more generally, there was the thematic view that automakers would be more price disciplined as demand moderates, given all the capacity changes and structural changes in the market. But obviously, here we are, looking at a 3% price decline year-over-year with very slight moderation in volume. And I know part of that for you was the F-Series.

I mean, Obviously, Rod, you've seen, as I mentioned earlier, kind of that pent-up demand go away. So now it's really about replacement value. In addition, you've seen used car prices go down, and when used car prices go down, obviously, there's an impact on the new car market. And then when you look at some of the elements that are driving the retail business, there's been extended payments. There's been higher leasing, the low interest rates. I mean, that plays itself out over time, and you can see our strategy around that, particularly in some of the leasing numbers, that Bob showed earlier. So I think those are some of the factors. Probably, there might be a factor of the noise that's going on right now around here in the U.S. around elections, and what that means because there's lots of things being said that could impact it as well."

So I think we need to put in context what's happening. I think we're in transition. If you go back and think about what's happened since 2009, the industry has grown way in excess of GDP over that period of time, and so we've all benefited from very, very robust growth of the industry. It is now plateauing. And I think the industry and all the players in the industry, we have to kind of pivot. We have to transition, and I think that's what's occurring. And the reason I'm encouraged by the -- encouraged to think that, that will occur successfully is the fact that, not only us, but everyone, all the big players are very, very focused on margins. They know that's important. They know that's what counts. They're focused on that. And I really believe that, ultimately, that will be the driver of decisions around how aggressively people go after a pie that isn't growing frankly anymore. The other thing that's probably different than it's been over the last 2 or 3 years is the yen. The yen has started to shrink in -- from the levels it had reached. I think it got to about a 120 level. It's been 100, 103, 105. I mean, that certainly puts some constraints on the Japanese participants in the market in terms of maybe some of the benefits and the windfalls of the weaker yen that they were deploying that just isn't there anymore. So I think it'll probably take some time, but I think that the discipline that we've seen will stick, and we'll get used to the new environment."

But first of all, we'll get out of some of the one-time unique issues that we saw in the second half and maybe to some extent, in the first half. But you'll also see, I think it does appear in these articles that are being written that the emerging market downturn, perhaps, globally is beginning to bottom out. I talked about the fact that Russia's already improving in terms of our own portfolio. There's a question earlier around South America. Our view, early view anyway, is that there could be very, very, very small levels of growth there next year, nothing to write home about, but it would be great to see a positive number with no brackets around it. And so that would be, perhaps, the beginning of the turn there and decline of the increased losses. So that's going to help. We're going to have, again, as we always do, a lot of product launches. And I think, going back to the earlier question around the portfolio, we really are focusing our investments very specifically to where we can make money. And I think that will be a phenomenon that will be even in sharper focus, going ahead, and I think that will benefit, for example, the Ford new SUVs that we've talked about globally. I mean those are the sweet spot of where our consumers are going. Those are higher margin products. That will start to help us as we move ahead, and the cost, I mean, we're going to really be -- we will see cost increases, I'll call them, that are healthy, to support the growing business, and certainly, to be a leader in all these emerging opportunities ahead. But other than that, we are going to be, as we have been, very focused on efficiencies and driving nonessential costs out of the business. We did that very successfully in the first half.

In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America. And this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty costs from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. 
Now during the quarter, in addition to the all-new Super Duty, we also launched the all-new Lincoln Continental. And I'll talk more about these as we go through the call. 
Looking at our global market share. It was down slightly, and we had improved share in Asia Pacific. And that was offset by results in North America, South America and Middle East and Africa. 
Turning to Europe. We had our best third quarter profit there since 2007. And it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there. 
Looking at Asia Pacific. We saw strong growth, plus our best-ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remained strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first 9 months of the year, our pretax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago. 
Now we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company. And that's a full year company adjusted pretax profit of about $10.2 billion.
Now if you turn to Slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the 4 drivers of shareholder value. And that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping [ph] fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers, as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region. 
We also announced our intent to have a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or a ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide, importantly, new sources of growth for Ford. 
In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong. And we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies net of economics across the business as we once again, in the quarter, delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan, and that's despite the large recall in the period. 
In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million. And that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attractive dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date, we've rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.
Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start. And we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important [ph] Truck of Texas Award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.
Moving over to Europe. We launched our new Ka+, which is imported from India, as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business. And the initial feedback on the Ka+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near term, with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.
So let's turn to our view of the global business environment, and you can see that on Slide 6. Global growth remains below trend. And that's due to recessions in key emerging markets as well as some constraints on business investment spending. 
Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume. Just looking at the U.K. in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. 
And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of the present cycle. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?"

In the first column, I just want to highlight sever",1776,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's turn to the next slide, Slide 8. This is our key financial summary. And I want to start by just baselining us with some of the key data. 
So we'll start with the third quarter. In the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics. So first, company adjusted pretax results of $1.4 billion, net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations. If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances, very, very strong and cash above our target of $20 million.
Now we're going through a number of these things in detail through the deck. But 2 things I want to highlight that we've long talked about. Again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pretax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations. And our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.
Now if I move over to the first 9 months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pretax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history. 
Okay, let's go to Slide 9. And now we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business. And these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left. And let's look at the segment results. $1.1 billion in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services, and then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations, $223 million negative. That's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about. 
Now if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable; South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart, though, I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So when we get to North America slide, this is really where the story for the business occurred in the quarter versus last year.
Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that here. We had guided to this quarter being about $1 million, [ph] which is 10% of our outlook for the full year. We did comment that our view of that is simply a recalendarization of some items from fourth into third, vice versa, and it's really around marketing accruals. So it's about $100 million, the good news, and marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. And the balance is a number of cost changes, cost improvements that's in place in the quarter. But it's $24 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost. And that will be offset in the fourth quarter, yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at our Investor Day.
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesales down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down 0.1 point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific was higher. 
If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on a global basis. That was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe. The other business units or regions were lower.  Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply. That was driven by North America. 
Now one of the things [ph] I want to touch on here, and I'll mention it again when we got to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall. If you recall from our 8-K that we issued, it's around $600 million. Not all companies do that. Some companies will treat that as a special item. We include it in operating results because it is a normal course of the -- of business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics, and 7% would have been 7.5%.  I'll say the same thing when we get to the North American slide. 
All right, let's go to Slide 11. And this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. And you can see we're down $1.7 billion. This was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then, of course, the impact of the recall. And you can see that in the warranty item in the call-out box for the contribution cost. 
I do want to mention net pricing. This is the first quarter we've had this year positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific. And that decline was just the usual downward overall industry pricing -- negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide. 
All right, let's move on to the regions. And we'll start as usual with North America on Slide 12. These are the key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%. That was driven by volume. Market share was down 0.5. Now within that, that's the region, Canada was actually up 1.6 points, and Mexico was up 0.3 point. The U.S. was down 0.7 point. That's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S., that was around a regional decline. That was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was [ph] more than explained by rental. That series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at the SAAR. It was down about 2/10, 200,000 units [ph] for the region. That was more than explained by the U.S. Consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis. 
Margin and PBT were down sharply. But again, if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So still a very healthy margin, and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which, again, are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.
Okay, let's move on to the following slide, and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So North America, down $1.6 billion. There are 3 things that are happening here. And I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about 1/3 of the entire decline. 
The first impact is the Super Duty launch. And so this is the effect of less volume but also launch cost that always comes along with a launch. So that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day. 
The second item is around normalization of F-150. And so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's 2 things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix. In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, normal balance of series mix and options, although it's still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago as we continue to maintain our production alignment to demand.
And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So those 3 things effectivity explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company.
I do want to highlight the positive pricing. This is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America, and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty, one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver. It was a major factor but not a key driver. So that was a very positive effect. And you can see on the far right, we did have continually -- continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.
In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%. That's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year."

Because our view is the industry, it is at a relatively strong level, but the retail market is softening, and the pricing environment is getting tougher.

And that's consistent with our strategy. We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter, and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. 
And then our approach on incentives -- Bob mentioned incentives in the industry. Our approach is to be competitive and disciplined. And I think as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritized margins over market share, and you can see that in our results."

And South America, the key metrics, as shown on this slide, Slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of economic indicators that, while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards. And so I think we feel comfortable that at least the direction of the economies in South America seemed to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past. But that's a positive sign. 
If you look at the metrics, the top line is lower. That's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower. That was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10%. That was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%. 
Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation as well as a negative operating exchange FX. [ph] The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost.
In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015. 
Okay, let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us. It was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007. If you look at the operating margins and profits, up very sharply. I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter or in the year over $1 billion, and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe.  The team has done a wonderful job, and it's showing up in the results. And that's despite the fact, if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the U.K. as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We certainly announced a price increase. A number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down. That was driven by those actions, although actually, in the quarter, the SAAR of U.K. was unchanged. But we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options. Good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange. We're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the nonrecurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. 
And one other thing [ph] I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories, we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is. But I'm very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business. 
In terms of guidance, clearly, we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago."

As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with Transit, which, once again, was the #1 commercial vehicle in the U.K. and also across Europe. 
What we are watching, though, is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors, have taken pricing in the U.K., and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be a negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So we're getting ahead of that, as Bob mentioned, from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the financial negative effects on the market."

If you look at the first and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here. 
So if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down. That's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume as well as the revenue. Our share was lower. Although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for Laurent, [ph] which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is the markets we participate in were declining, and [indiscernible] was growing. So it's a geographic mix effect.
What's happening in terms of profitability is issues [ph] in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's very oil-based to one that's more diverse, pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We're working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter, probably a loss but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter. But year-to-date, you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter nor do we see this as a run rate.  For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago. But again, think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made. 
Okay, let's move on to Asia Pacific.  This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember, we talked about performance issues in China. And then -- and Mark, I think, had some commentary around the actions the team that were [ph] working to address that. I have to tell you, they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here wholesales up 30%, the revenue's up 16%. The share improved. And that's not just China. We had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN, India. So it's pretty broad-based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements. In fact, most of the improvements is coming from outside China. 
But having said that, if you look on the far right towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute, on an equity after-tax basis, $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million. And our margin came in at 13.4%. Look, it [ph] was an improvement of 0.7 point from a year ago. So feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China but broadly across the region. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in our profitability, up $100 million. And you can see it was driven primarily by volume. 
If you go across of the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region. This was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so. We were up a bit more than that. But it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations had been at the beginning of the year.
So when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was a year ago. And that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi."

Importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month and also then increased profitability for the quarter. 
And as we look forward, obviously, we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches. We'll have a full quarter of the fresh and [ph], we have the Mondale [ph] coming in, in the quarter, and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point."

Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter, $567 million. That was up a little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. 
Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow. That was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio, performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise but still below what we would consider to be a normal level. It's probably more around 50, 60 basis points. 
So if we go to the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by higher charge-offs. And our lease residuals also were down on a year-over-year basis. And that was driven by, as you can see in the callout box, our outlook for lower auction values, particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles in [ph] our portfolio. 
Let's go to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit. Just want to highlight the top 2. So on the upper left, you can see auction values. Our auction values continue to decline. They were down $235 sequentially, looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio, and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products. 
If you look at the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail, retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down, although at a very high level. We're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year, and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business, also in recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years, and so we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.
Okay, let's move now to Automotive cash flow. And you can see here towards the middle of the page the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in the working capital largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks. And then you can see there's also an adverse effect on[ph]  timing differences. Again, that was related to the stock changes and the impact that had on our marketing accruals. 
If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million. We're actually changing our guidance for the full year on pension contributions. We expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we had guided to. That $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. 
Dividends came in at $600 million, and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.
Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So I just wanted to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you the last time. They're still looking very, very good for the Automotive business as well as Ford Credit. I would like to highlight the pension performance. You can see $7 billion in terms of our funded status. But I just want to remind you that we will remeasure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So this reported number does not reflect the impact from the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016. I will say, however, because of all the actions we've taken over the last number of years to derisk and to fund our pension plans, that we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end '16. That will largely be outside of the U.S. because we're ahead of the overseas market in terms of getting those plans funded. 
So with that, that concludes my comments, and we'll turn it over to Mark."

Now as you've seen, we have had a strong first 9 months to the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pretax profit to be about $10.2 billion and, again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000. And just kind of bringing it all together, if you go to Slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever, as I mentioned. But that's following a third quarter that was better than expected but lower than a year ago, as we guided. 
We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see as a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S. and, of course, uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit. 
Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong. And we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. 
And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our road map to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans, the performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and, of course, our parts business, [ph] transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed, and that includes luxury, small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.
So with that, why don't we just open it up and take your questions.[ph]"

So I guess, my question is, when you -- when you're positioning and talking about the strategy and perhaps, willing to accept lower market share, but protect profitably, does that strategy kind of vary on a product-by-product basis? I know you're adding quite a bit of content here on some of these vehicles, particularly the pickup trucks. So does that limit your options vis-a-vis, pricing competitiveness?"

So in terms of Brexit, and it's a fact. So what we said in the second quarter, just a reminder, we took about a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet because of the weakness of the Sterling that occurred after the vote. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year, and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So we've already start to do that in the quarter. So we start to make those stock adjustments. So as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe. Even on the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we start to take stocks down. So we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus the stock build a year ago. We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on industry volume, which we're just getting ahead of it with a adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we are expecting, yes, we've gone the ability to add to that. So we'll be very flexible on that. In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the fact is probably about $600 million. So think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half on a full year basis and the balance is around Sterling. And if anything, there could be potentially some risks on the Sterling given how weak it became following the jury conference and the conference from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So we saw a little bit of exposure. But we're comfortable right now with that $600 million. If you look at Asia Pacific in terms of what's happening with pricing and in the year-to-date, the industry's down about 6%. The best we can tell we're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate. We talked about that in the second quarter. We saw that continue to moderate in the third And the third quarter industry year-over-year was down about 4%, I think we were down about 5% and sequentially, I think it was down about 1, 1.3 points. So we are seeing a decline of the pace of the decline in pricing there. We felt that into our outlook. Do you want to add anything to that?"

And to give you just a couple of data points where we have a very high series mix on our Transit. Ranger, over 50% of the mix on Ranger is the wild track version, which is the high end version.

In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics.

In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America. And this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty costs from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. 
Now during the quarter, in addition to the all-new Super Duty, we also launched the all-new Lincoln Continental. And I'll talk more about these as we go through the call. 
Looking at our global market share. It was down slightly, and we had improved share in Asia Pacific. And that was offset by results in North America, South America and Middle East and Africa. 
Turning to Europe. We had our best third quarter profit there since 2007. And it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there. 
Looking at Asia Pacific. We saw strong growth, plus our best-ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remained strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first 9 months of the year, our pretax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago. 
Now we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company. And that's a full year company adjusted pretax profit of about $10.2 billion.
Now if you turn to Slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the 4 drivers of shareholder value. And that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers, as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region. 
We also announced our intent to have a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or a ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide, importantly, new sources of growth for Ford. 
In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong. And we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies net of economics across the business as we once again, in the quarter, delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan, and that's despite the large recall in the period. 
In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million. And that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attractive dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date, we've rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.
Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start. And we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas Award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.
Moving over to Europe. We launched our new Ka+, which is imported from India, as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business. And the initial feedback on the Ka+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near term, with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.
So let's turn to our view of the global business environment, and you can see that on Slide 6. Global growth remains below trend. And that's due to recessions in key emerging markets as well as some constraints on business investment spending. 
Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume. Just looking at the U.K. in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. 
And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of the present cycle. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?"

And I want to start by just baselining us with some of the key data. 
So we'll start with the third quarter. In the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics. So first, company adjusted pretax results of $1.4 billion, net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations. If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances, very, very strong and cash above our target of $20 million.
Now we're going through a number of these things in detail through the deck. But 2 things I want to highlight that we've long talked about. Again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pretax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations. And our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.
Now if I move over to the first 9 months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pretax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history. 
Okay, let's go to Slide 9. And now we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business. And these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left. And let's look at the segment results. $1.1 billion in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services, and then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations, $223 million negative. That's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about. 
Now if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable; South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart, though, I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So when we get to North America slide, this is really where the story for the business occurred in the quarter versus last year.
Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that here. We had guided to this quarter being about $1 million, which is 10% of our outlook for the full year. We did comment that our view of that is simply a recalendarization of some items from fourth into third, vice versa, and it's really around marketing accruals. So it's about $100 million, the good news, and marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. And the balance is a number of cost changes, cost improvements that's in place in the quarter. But it's $24 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost. And that will be offset in the fourth quarter, yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at our Investor Day.
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesales down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down 0.1 point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific was higher. 
If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on a global basis. That was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe. The other business units or regions were lower. Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply. That was driven by North America. 
Now one of the things I want to touch on here, and I'll mention it again when we got to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall. If you recall from our 8-K that we issued, it's around $600 million. Not all companies do that. Some companies will treat that as a special item. We include it in operating results because it is a normal course of the -- of business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics, and 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North American slide. 
All right, let's go to Slide 11. And this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. And you can see we're down $1.7 billion. This was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then, of course, the impact of the recall. And you can see that in the warranty item in the call-out box for the contribution cost. 
I do want to mention net pricing. This is the first quarter we've had this year positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific. And that decline was just the usual downward overall industry pricing -- negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide. 
All right, let's move on to the regions. And we'll start as usual with North America on Slide 12. These are the key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%. That was driven by volume. Market share was down 0.5. Now within that, that's the region, Canada was actually up 1.6 points, and Mexico was up 0.3 point. The U.S. was down 0.7 point. That's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S., that was around a regional decline. That was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. That series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at the SAAR. It was down about 2/10, 200,000 units for the region. That was more than explained by the U.S. Consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis. 
Margin and PBT were down sharply. But again, if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So still a very healthy margin, and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which, again, are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.
Okay, let's move on to the following slide, and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So North America, down $1.6 billion. There are 3 things that are happening here. And I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about 1/3 of the entire decline. 
The first impact is the Super Duty launch. And so this is the effect of less volume but also launch cost that always comes along with a launch. So that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day. 
The second item is around normalization of F-150. And so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's 2 things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix. In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, normal balance of series mix and options, although it's still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago as we continue to maintain our production alignment to demand.
And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So those 3 things effectivity explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company.
I do want to highlight the positive pricing. This is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America, and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty, one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver. It was a major factor but not a key driver. So that was a very positive effect. And you can see on the far right, we did have continually -- continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.
In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%. That's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year."

And that's consistent with our strategy. We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter, and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. 
And then our approach on incentives -- Bob mentioned incentives in the industry. Our approach is to be competitive and disciplined. And I think as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritized margins over market share, and you can see that in our results."

And South America, the key metrics, as shown on this slide, Slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of economic indicators that, while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards. And so I think we feel comfortable that at least the direction of the economies in South America seemed to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past. But that's a positive sign. 
If you look at the metrics, the top line is lower. That's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower. That was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10%. That was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%. 
Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation as well as a negative operating exchange effects. The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost.
In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015. 
Okay, let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us. It was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007. If you look at the operating margins and profits, up very sharply. I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter or in the year over $1 billion, and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job, and it's showing up in the results. And that's despite the fact, if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the U.K. as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We certainly announced a price increase. A number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down. That was driven by those actions, although actually, in the quarter, the SAAR of U.K. was unchanged. But we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options. Good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange. We're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the nonrecurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. 
And one other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories, we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is. But I'm very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business. 
In terms of guidance, clearly, we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago."

And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with Transit, which, once again, was the #1 commercial vehicle in the U.K. and also across Europe. 
What we are watching, though, is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors, have taken pricing in the U.K., and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be a negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So we're getting ahead of that, as Bob mentioned, from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the financial negative effects on the market."

If you look at the first and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here. 
So if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down. That's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume as well as the revenue. Our share was lower. Although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is the markets we participate in were declining, and Iran was growing. So it's a geographic mix effect.
What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's very oil-based to one that's more diverse, pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We're working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter, probably a loss but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter. But year-to-date, you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago. But again, think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made. 
Okay, let's move on to Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember, we talked about performance issues in China. And then -- and Mark, I think, had some commentary around the actions of the team that were working to address that. I have to tell you, they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here wholesales up 30%, the revenue's up 16%. The share improved. And that's not just China. We had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN, India. So it's pretty broad-based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements. In fact, most of the improvements is coming from outside China. 
But having said that, if you look on the far right towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute, on an equity after-tax basis, $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million. And our margin came in at 13.4%, which was an improvement of 0.7 point from a year ago. So feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China but broadly across the region. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in our profitability, up $100 million. And you can see it was driven primarily by volume. 
If you go across of the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region. This was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so. We were up a bit more than that. But it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations had been at the beginning of the year.
So when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was a year ago. And that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi."

And the reason for that is we're going to really leverage our new product launches and also step up our go-to-market strategy. And as you can see from the results, we had market share improvement. Importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month and also then increased profitability for the quarter. 
And as we look forward, obviously, we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches. We'll have a full quarter of the freshened Cougar, we have the Mondeo coming in, in the quarter, and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point."

If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 bil",806,"Okay, let's turn to Ford Credit on Slide 21. Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter, $567 million. That was up a little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. 
Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow. That was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio, performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise but still below what we would consider to be a normal level. It's probably more around 50, 60 basis points. 
So if we go to the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by higher charge-offs. And our lease residuals also were down on a year-over-year basis. And that was driven by, as you can see in the callout box, our outlook for lower auction values, particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio. 
Let's go to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit. Just want to highlight the top 2. So on the upper left, you can see auction values. Our auction values continue to decline. They were down $235 sequentially, looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio, and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products. 
If you look at the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail, retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down, although at a very high level. We're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year, and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business, also in recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years, and so we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.
Okay, let's move now to Automotive cash flow. And you can see here towards the middle of the page the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in the working capital largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks. And then you can see there's also an adverse effect on timing differences. Again, that was related to the stock changes and the impact that had on our marketing accruals. 
If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million. We're actually changing our guidance for the full year on pension contributions. We expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we had guided to. That $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. 
Dividends came in at $600 million, and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.
Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So I just wanted to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you the last time. They're still looking very, very good for the Automotive business as well as Ford Credit. I would like to highlight the pension performance. You can see $7 billion in terms of our funded status. But I just want to remind you that we will remeasure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So this reported number does not reflect the impact from the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016. I will say, however, because of all the actions we've taken over the last number of years to derisk and to fund our pension plans, that we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end '16. That will largely be outside of the U.S. because we're ahead of the overseas market in terms of getting those plans funded. 
So with that, that concludes my comments, and we'll turn it over to Mark."

Okay, if you turn to Slide 26, this sums up our industry and also our GDP planning assumptions. And all in all, we see some risks to global GDP growth as you have things like policy uncertainty, including what's going on with budget negotiation. That adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows but also just business investment spending in total. And this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets. So today, we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9%, and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. 
For industry volumes, we're providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe, with a small downward adjustment for Brazil.
Now as you've seen, we have had a strong first 9 months to the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pretax profit to be about $10.2 billion and, again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000. And just kind of bringing it all together, if you go to Slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever, as I mentioned. But that's following a third quarter that was better than expected but lower than a year ago, as we guided. 
We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see as a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S. and, of course, uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit. 
Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong. And we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. 
And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our road map to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans, the performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and, of course, our parts business, transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed, and that includes luxury, small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.

So in terms of Brexit, it's a fact. So what we saw in the second quarter, just to remind you, we took about a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet because of the weakness of the sterling that occurred after the vote on the 23rd. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year, and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So we've already started to do that in the quarter, so we've started to make those stock adjustments. So as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe, even though the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we've started to take stocks down. So we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus a stock build a year ago. We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on industry volume. We're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, yes, we've got the ability to react to that. So we'll be very flexible on that. In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling. And if anything, there could be potentially some risk on the sterling given how weak it became following the Tory conference and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So we saw a little bit of exposure, but we're comfortable right now with that $600 million. If you look at Asia Pacific in terms of what's happening with pricing, in the year-to-date, the industry's down about 6%. And the best we can tell, we're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate. We talked about that in the second quarter. We saw that continue to moderate in the third. And the third quarter industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%. And sequentially, I think it was down about 1, 1.3 points.

And you're in an interesting position to be able to commercialize these relatively affordable technologies that really address that. And I'm sure it's in everybody's interest that you do that. And we know you're aware, and it's in your interest, and you want to do it. I guess the question for you is, how much on a per unit basis as -- you talked to Russia's team and your suppliers. How much would it take, putting aside the fully autonomous robo stuff, to make a real dent in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian safety? Like per car, are we talking -- to make accidents like 1/3 less likely for your new vehicles, is it hundreds of dollars a car? Is it $1,000? Or is it several thousands? Just high level, Mark. Would really appreciate it given all your exposure to this technological discussion."

And if you look at the pricing, we're very competitive along those lines. To your question around the fatalities, that's why we're so bullish on autonomous vehicles and, as you know, the societal and safety benefits that can have from that. But let's face it, I haven't seen the data yet. But if you really want to improve vehicle safety, you take people's phones away from them so they can't text while they're driving because I have a feeling that a lot of the increase on that has to do with that. Now we -- our approach on that is through our SYNC system, allow people to do it, rather than touching their phones, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel. And that's our approach. But it's an interesting question but one in which I can't give you an exact answer."

So I mean, I'm asking because I remember that the F-150 launch, it went better than expected, right, with cost to produce being a little bit less, and that was one of the drivers of upside in 2015.

It came up very well. The quality is good coming out of the plant. We -- the suppliers are performing well. We do have initially one supplier that's trying to keep with -- up with us on demand, and we're working with them on that. But as our usual process, we'll launch, settle the plant down, and that's where the teams -- once we get to the launch levels and the plant is stable, that's when we really start going to town on looking at, are there ways of getting more efficient in terms of the productivity on the line but also material costs? In terms of 2017, we're going to continue to follow that pattern. In terms of impacts, as Bob has mentioned, when you look at the margins on the new Super Duty, they are lower than the previous one, and that's because it's the first time we've redone the product in 18 years.

It's just -- the thing that you just got to keep in mind, Ryan, I think this is a different conversation than in Japan or Indonesia, is the external environment is sort of similar to Russia and South America. This is an environment that's been affected by the commodity cycle. It's been very affected by oil, particularly in the Middle East. It's been affected to some extent by geopolitical issues. So I think it's a different conversation and discussion. I think we'll end up with much better results in the fourth quarter based on what we see today.

In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America. And this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty costs from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. 
Now during the quarter, in addition to the all-new Super Duty, we also launched the all-new Lincoln Continental. And I'll talk more about these as we go through the call. 
Looking at our global market share. It was down slightly, and we had improved share in Asia Pacific. And that was offset by results in North America, South America and Middle East and Africa. 
Turning to Europe. We had our best third quarter profit there since 2007. And it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there. 
Looking at Asia Pacific. We saw strong growth, plus our best-ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remained strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first 9 months of the year, our pretax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago. 
Now we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company. And that's a full year company adjusted pretax profit of about $10.2 billion.
Now if you turn to Slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the 4 drivers of shareholder value. And that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers, as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region. 
We also announced our intent to have a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or a ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide, importantly, new sources of growth for Ford. 
In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong. And we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies net of economics across the business as we once again, in the quarter, delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan, and that's despite the large recall in the period. 
In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million. And that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attractive dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date, we've rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.
Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start. And we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas Award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.
Moving over to Europe. We launched our new Ka+, which is imported from India, as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business. And the initial feedback on the Ka+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near term, with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.
So let's turn to our view of the global business environment, and you can see that on Slide 6. Global growth remains below trend. And that's due to recessions in key emerging markets as well as some constraints on business investment spending. 
Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume. Just looking at the U.K. in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. 
And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of the present cycle. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?"

And I want to start by just baselining this with some of the key data. 
So we'll start with the third quarter. In the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics. So first, company adjusted pretax results of $1.4 billion, net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations. If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances, very, very strong and cash above our target of $20 billion.
Now we're going through a number of these things in detail through the deck. But 2 things I want to highlight that we wont talk about again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pretax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations. And our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.
Now if I move over to the first 9 months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pretax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history. 
Okay, let's go to Slide 9. And now we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business. And these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left. And let's look at the segment results. $1.1 billion in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services, and then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations, $223 million negative. That's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about. 
Now if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable; South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart, though, I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So when we get to North America's slide, this is really where the story for the business occurred in the quarter versus last year.
Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that here. We had guided to this quarter being about $1 billion, which is 10% of our outlook for the full year. We did comment that our view of that is simply a recalendarization of some items from fourth into third, vice versa, and it's really around marketing accruals. So it's about $100 million, the good news, and marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. And the balance is a number of cost changes, cost improvements that took place in the quarter. But it's $20 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost. And that will be offset in the fourth quarter, yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at our Investor Day.
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesales down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down 0.1 point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific was higher. 
If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on a global basis. That was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe. The other business units or regions were lower. Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply. That was driven by North America. 
Now one of the things I want to touch on here, and I'll mention it again when we got to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall, which if you recall from our 8-K that we issued, it's around $600 million. Not all companies do that. Some companies will treat that as a special item. We include it in operating results because it is a normal course of the -- of business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics, and 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North American slide. 
All right, let's go to Slide 11. And this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. And you can see we're down $1.7 billion. This was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then, of course, the impact of the recall. And you can see that in the warranty item in the call-out box for the contribution cost. 
I do want to mention net pricing. This is the first quarter we've had this year positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific. And that decline was just the usual downward overall industry pricing -- negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide. 
All right, let's move on to the regions. And we'll start as usual with North America on Slide 12. These are the key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%. That was driven by volume. Market share was down 0.5. Now within that, that's the region, Canada was actually up 1.6 points, and Mexico was up 0.3 point. The U.S. was down 0.7 point. That's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S., that was around a regional decline. That was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. F-Series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at the SAAR. It was down about 2/10, 200,000 units for the region. That was more than explained by the U.S. Consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis. 
Margin and PBT were down sharply. But again, if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So still a very healthy margin, and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which, again, are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.
Okay, let's move on to the following slide, and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So North America, down $1.6 billion. There are 3 things that are happening here. And I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about 1/3 of the entire decline. 
The first impact is the Super Duty launch. And so this is the effect of less volume but also launch cost that always comes along with a launch. So that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day. 
The second item is around normalization of F-150. And so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's 2 things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of a launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix. In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, normal balance of series mix and options, although it's still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago as we continue to maintain our production in line with demand.
And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So those 3 things effectivity explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company.
I do want to highlight the positive pricing. This is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America, and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty, one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver. It was a major factor but not the key driver. So that was a very positive effect. And you can see on the far right, we did have continually -- continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.
In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%. That's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year."

Because our view is the industry, it is at a relatively strong level, but the retail market is softening, and the pricing environment is getting tougher. And as you've seen and as we've communicated previously, we have taken some production adjustments on a number of selected models to match production to demand. And that's consistent with our strategy. We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter, and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. 
And then our approach on incentives -- Bob mentioned incentives in the industry. Our approach is to be competitive and disciplined. And I think as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritized margins over market share, and you can see that in our results."

And South America, the key metrics, as shown on this slide, Slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of economic indicators that, while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards. And so I think we feel comfortable that at least the direction of the economies in South America seem to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past. But that's a positive sign. 
If you look at the metrics, the top line is lower. That's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower. That was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10%. That was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%. 
Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation as well as a negative operating exchange effects. The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost.
In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015. 
Okay, let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us. It was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007. If you look at the operating margins and profits, up very sharply. I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter or in the year over $1 billion, and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job, and it's showing up in the results. And that's despite the fact, if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the U.K. as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We've certainly announced a price increase. A number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down. That was driven by those actions, although actually, in the quarter, the SAAR of U.K. was unchanged. But we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options. Good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange. We're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the nonrecurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. 
And what the other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories, we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is. But I'm very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business. 
In terms of guidance, clearly, we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago."

As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with Transit, which, once again, was the #1 commercial vehicle in the U.K. and also across Europe. 
What we are watching, though, is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors, have taken pricing in the U.K., and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be a negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So we're getting ahead of that, as Bob mentioned, from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the financial negative effects on the market."

If you look at the first and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here. 
So if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down. That's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume as well as the revenue. Our share was lower. Although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is the markets we participate in were declining, and Iran was growing. So it's a geographic mix effect.
What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's very oil-based to one that's more diverse, pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We're working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter, probably a loss still, but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter. But year-to-date, you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago. But again, think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made. 
Okay, let's move on to Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember, we talked about performance issues in China. And then -- and Mark, I think, had some commentary around the actions of the team that were working to address that. I have to tell you, they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here wholesales up 30%, the revenue's up 16%. The share improved. And that's not just China. We had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN, India. So it's pretty broad-based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements. In fact, most of the improvements coming from outside China. 
But having said that, if you look on the far right towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute, on an equity after-tax basis, $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million. And our margin came in at 13.4%, which was an improvement of 0.7 point from a year ago. So feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China but broadly across the region. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in our profitability, up $100 million. And you can see it was driven primarily by volume. 
If you go across of the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region. This was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so. We were up a bit more than that. But it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations had been at the beginning of the year.
So when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was a year ago. And that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi."

Importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month and also then increased profitability for the quarter. 
And as we look forward, obviously, we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches. We'll have a full quarter of the freshened Cougar, we have the Mondeo coming in, in the quarter, and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point."

Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter, $567 million. That was up a little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. 
Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow. That was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio, performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise but still below what we would consider to be a normal level. It's probably more around 50, 60 basis points. 
So if we go to the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by higher charge-offs. And our lease residuals also were down on a year-over-year basis. And that was driven by, as you can see in the callout box, our outlook for lower auction values, particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio. 
Let's go to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit. Just want to highlight the top 2. So on the upper left, you can see auction values. Our auction values continue to decline. They were down $235 sequentially, looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio, and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products. 
If you look at the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail, retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down, although at a very high level. We're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year, and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business, also in recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years, and so we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.
Okay, let's move now to Automotive cash flow. And you can see here towards the middle of the page the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in working capital largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks. And then you can see there's also an adverse effect on timing differences. Again, that was related to the stock changes and the impact that had on our marketing accruals. 
If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million. We're actually changing our guidance for the full year on pension contributions. We expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we had guided to. That $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. 
Dividends came in at $600 million, and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.
Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So I just wanted to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you the last time. They're still looking very, very good for the Automotive business as well as Ford Credit. I would like to highlight the pension performance. You can see $7 billion in terms of our funded status. But I just want to remind you that we will remeasure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So this reported number does not reflect the impact from the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016. I will say, however, because of all the actions we've taken over the last number of years to derisk and to fund our pension plans, that we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end '16. That will largely be outside of the U.S. because we're ahead of the overseas markets in terms of getting those plans funded. 
So with that, that concludes my comments, and we'll turn it over to Mark."

That adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows but also just business investment spending in total. And this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets. So today, we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9%, and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. 
For industry volumes, we're providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe, with a small downward adjustment for Brazil.
Now as you've seen, we have had a strong first 9 months to the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pretax profit to be about $10.2 billion and, again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000. And just kind of bringing it all together, if you go to Slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever, as I mentioned. But that's following a third quarter that was better than expected but lower than a year ago, as we guided. 
We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see as a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S. and, of course, uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit. 
Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong. And we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. 
And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our road map to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans to performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and, of course, our parts business, transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed, and that includes luxury, small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.
So with that, why don't we just open it up and take your questions?"

In terms of looking at, is it impacting in the showroom, you can say it's having some level of impact. At the same time, we do have an opportunity to take those funds we would spend on that and put them over to maybe some retail incentives. So yes, in general, it probably has some level of impact. It depends on the region, obviously depending upon the leasing concentration, but probably modest at this point."

So in terms of Brexit, its effect. So what we saw in the second quarter, just to remind you, we took about a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet because of the weakness of the sterling that occurred after the vote on the 23rd. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year, and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So we've already started to do that in the quarter, so we've started to make those stock adjustments. So as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe, even though the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we've started to take stocks down. So we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus a stock build a year ago. We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on industry volume. We're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, we've got the ability to react to that. So we'll be very flexible on that. In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling. And if anything, there could be potentially some risk on the sterling given how weak it became following the Tory conference and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So we saw a little bit of exposure, but we're comfortable right now with that $600 million. If you look at Asia Pacific in terms of what's happening with pricing, in the year-to-date, the industry's down about 6%. And the best we can tell, we're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate. We talked about that in the second quarter. We saw that continue to moderate in the third. And the third quarter industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%. And sequentially, I think it was down about 1, 1.3 points. So we are seeing a decline of -- the pace of the decline in pricing, and we've built that into our outlook. Do you want to add anything to that?"

Pickups in general are still strong. If you look at just September, we had our strongest retail F-Series month of the year. And when you look at the demand, obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we saw a lot of variability in incentive spend from the competitors. And as I said, when you look at the metrics on how we're performing in terms of incentive spends, transaction prices, et cetera, the response to the new Super Duty and transaction prices literally near the top of the industry, we feel pretty good about the full-size pickup segment. But at the same time, you have to think about it in terms of overall what we're seeing in the industry in terms of some weakening in the retail. And we'll keep watching it. And that's why we're being proactive around our stocks. We want to protect that brand, we want to protect that franchise, and we want to protect the residual values for our customers."

When you look at the balance of the year, we're not going to have a stronger quarter in the fourth quarter, and the team will talk about that in the call at 11:00. So that is largely around what's happening and is going to continue to happen on residual values. The only thing I would highlight that will be unusual in that quarter that doesn't change the company results, it's just a payment that's going to go from one part of the business to the other, which is about $80 million payment that Ford Credit is going to make to Ford of Europe. And that's around funding the gaps that we have in one of the plans in -- pension plans in Europe that Ford Credit is going to satisfy. And then Ford Europe will actually kind of manage that going forward. And so that will be a shift of $80 million between the 2. But -- so it'll affect Europe's -- or rather Credit's results but has no impact on the business. It'll be good news in Europe.

And as you saw from the results and Bob mentioned, the mix improvements have not only come from the products, the product line mix, like Mondeo and Mustang and Ranger, but it's also come by a very deliberate strategy on series mix. And to give you just a couple of data points where we have a very high series mix on our Transit, Ranger, over 50% of the mix on Ranger is the Wildtrak version, which is the high-end version.

In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was",862,"Okay. Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered our better-than-expected company adjusted pretax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America. And this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty costs from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. 
Now during the quarter, in addition to the all-new Super Duty, we also launched the all-new Lincoln Continental. And I'll talk more about these as we go through the call. 
Looking at our global market share. It was down slightly, and we had improved share in Asia Pacific. And that was offset by results in North America, South America and Middle East and Africa. 
Turning to Europe. We had our best third quarter profit there since 2007. And it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there. 
Looking at Asia Pacific. We saw strong growth, plus our best-ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remained strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first 9 months of the year, our pretax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago. 
Now we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company. And that's a full year company adjusted pretax profit of about $10.2 billion.
Now if you turn to Slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the 4 drivers of shareholder value. And that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers, as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region. 
We also announced our intent to have a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or a ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide, importantly, new sources of growth for Ford. 
In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong. And we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies net of economics across the business as we once again, in the quarter, delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan, and that's despite the large recall in the period. 
In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million. And that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attractive dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date, we've rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.
Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start. And we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas Award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.
Moving over to Europe. We launched our new Ka+, which is imported from India, as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business. And the initial feedback on the Ka+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near term, with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.
So let's turn to our view of the global business environment, and you can see that on Slide 6. Global growth remains below trend. And that's due to recessions in key emerging markets as well as some constraints on business investment spending. 
Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume. Just looking at the U.K. in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. 
And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of the present cycle. 
So with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?"

And I want to start by just baselining this with some of the key data. 
So we'll start with the third quarter. In the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics. So first, company adjusted pretax results of $1.4 billion, net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations. If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances, very, very strong and cash above our target of $20 billion.
Now we're going through a number of these things in detail through the deck. But 2 things I want to highlight that we won't talk about again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pretax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations. And our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.
Now if I move over to the first 9 months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pretax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history. 
Okay, let's go to Slide 9. And now we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business. And these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left. And let's look at the segment results. $1.1 billion in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services, and then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations, $223 million negative. That's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about. 
Now if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable; South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart, though, I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So when we get to North America's slide, this is really where the story for the business occurred in the quarter versus last year.
Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that here. We had guided to this quarter being about $1 billion, which is 10% of our outlook for the full year. We did comment that our view of that is simply a recalendarization of some items from fourth into third, vice versa, and it's really around marketing accruals. So it's about $100 million, the good news, and marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. And the balance is a number of cost changes, cost improvements that took place in the quarter. But it's $20 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost. And that will be offset in the fourth quarter, yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at our Investor Day.
Okay, let's go on to the next slide, Slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesales down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down 0.1 point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific was higher. 
If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on a global basis. That was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe. The other business units or regions were lower. Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply. That was driven by North America. 
Now one of the things I want to touch on here, and I'll mention it again when we got to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall, which if you recall from our 8-K that we issued, it's around $600 million. Not all companies do that. Some companies will treat that as a special item. We include it in operating results because it is a normal course of the -- of business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics, and 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North American slide. 
All right, let's go to Slide 11. And this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. And you can see we're down $1.7 billion. This was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then, of course, the impact of the recall. And you can see that in the warranty item in the call-out box for the contribution cost. 
I do want to mention net pricing. This is the first quarter we've had this year positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific. And that decline was just the usual downward overall industry pricing -- negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide. 
All right, let's move on to the regions. And we'll start as usual with North America on Slide 12. These are the key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%. That was driven by volume. Market share was down 0.5. Now within that, that's the region, Canada was actually up 1.6 points, and Mexico was up 0.3 point. The U.S. was down 0.7 point. That's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S., that was around a regional decline. That was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. F-Series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
When you look at the SAAR. It was down about 2/10, 200,000 units for the region. That was more than explained by the U.S. Consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis. 
Margin and PBT were down sharply. But again, if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So still a very healthy margin, and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which, again, are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.
Okay, let's move on to the following slide, and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So North America, down $1.6 billion. There are 3 things that are happening here. And I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about 1/3 of the entire decline. 
The first impact is the Super Duty launch. And so this is the effect of less volume but also launch cost that always comes along with a launch. So that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day. 
The second item is around normalization of F-150. And so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's 2 things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of a launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix. In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, normal balance of series mix and options, although it's still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago as we continue to maintain our production in line with demand.
And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So those 3 things effectivity explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company.
I do want to highlight the positive pricing. This is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America, and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty, one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver. It was a major factor but not the key driver. So that was a very positive effect. And you can see on the far right, we did have continually -- continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.
In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%. That's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year."

And then our approach on incentives -- Bob mentioned incentives in the industry. Our approach is to be competitive and disciplined.

And South America, the key metrics, as shown on this slide, Slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of economic indicators that, while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards. And so I think we feel comfortable that at least the direction of the economies in South America seem to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past. But that's a positive sign. 
If you look at the metrics, the top line is lower. That's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower. That was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10%. That was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%. 
Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation as well as a negative operating exchange effects. The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost.
In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015. 
Okay, let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us. It was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007. If you look at the operating margins and profits, up very sharply. I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter or in the year over $1 billion, and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job, and it's showing up in the results. And that's despite the fact, if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the U.K. as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We've certainly announced a price increase. A number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down. That was driven by those actions, although actually, in the quarter, the SAAR of U.K. was unchanged. But we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options. Good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange. We're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the nonrecurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. 
And what the other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories, we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is. But I'm very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business. 
In terms of guidance, clearly, we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago."

As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with Transit, which, once again, was the #1 commercial vehicle in the U.K. and also across Europe. 
What we are watching, though, is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors, have taken pricing in the U.K., and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be a negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So we're getting ahead of that, as Bob mentioned, from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the financial negative effects on the market."

If you look at the first and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here. 
So if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down. That's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume as well as the revenue. Our share was lower. Although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is the markets we participate in were declining, and Iran was growing. So it's a geographic mix effect.
What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's very oil-based to one that's more diverse, pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We're working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter, probably a loss still, but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter. But year-to-date, you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago. But again, think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made. 
Okay, let's move on to Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember, we talked about performance issues in China. And then -- and Mark, I think, had some commentary around the actions of the team that were working to address that. I have to tell you, they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here wholesales up 30%, the revenue's up 16%. The share improved. And that's not just China. We had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN, India. So it's pretty broad-based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements. In fact, most of the improvements coming from outside China. 
But having said that, if you look on the far right towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute, on an equity after-tax basis, $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million. And our margin came in at 13.4%, which was an improvement of 0.7 point from a year ago. So feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China but broadly across the region. 
Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in our profitability, up $100 million. And you can see it was driven primarily by volume. 
If you go across of the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region. This was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so. We were up a bit more than that. But it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations had been at the beginning of the year.
So when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was a year ago. And that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi."

And the reason for that is we were going to really leverage our new product launches and also step up our go-to-market strategy. And as you can see from the results, we had market share improvement. Importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month and also then increased profitability for the quarter. 
And as we look forward, obviously, we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches. We'll have a full quarter of the freshened Cougar, we have the Mondeo coming in, in the quarter, and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point."

Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter, $567 million. That was up a little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. 
Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow. That was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio, performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise but still below what we would consider to be a normal level. It's probably more around 50, 60 basis points. 
So if we go to the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by higher charge-offs. And our lease residuals also were down on a year-over-year basis. And that was driven by, as you can see in the callout box, our outlook for lower auction values, particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio. 
Let's go to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit. Just want to highlight the top 2. So on the upper left, you can see auction values. Our auction values continue to decline. They were down $235 sequentially, looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio, and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products. 
If you look at the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail, retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down, although at a very high level. We're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year, and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business, also in recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years, and so we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.
Okay, let's move now to Automotive cash flow. And you can see here towards the middle of the page the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in working capital largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks. And then you can see there's also an adverse effect on timing differences. Again, that was related to the stock changes and the impact that had on our marketing accruals. 
If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million. We're actually changing our guidance for the full year on pension contributions. We expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we had guided to. That $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. 
Dividends came in at $600 million, and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.
Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So I just wanted to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you the last time. They're still looking very, very good for the Automotive business as well as Ford Credit. I would like to highlight the pension performance. You can see $7 billion in terms of our funded status. But I just want to remind you that we will remeasure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So this reported number does not reflect the impact from the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016. I will say, however, because of all the actions we've taken over the last number of years to derisk and to fund our pension plans, that we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end '16. That will largely be outside of the U.S. because we're ahead of the overseas markets in terms of getting those plans funded. 
So with that, that concludes my comments, and we'll turn it over to Mark."

Okay, if you turn to Slide 26, this sums up our industry and also our GDP planning assumptions. And all in all, we see some risks to global GDP growth as you have things like policy uncertainty, including what's going on with budget negotiation. That adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows but also just business investment spending in total. And this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets. So today, we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9%, and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. 
For industry volumes, we're providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe, with a small downward adjustment for Brazil.
Now as you've seen, we have had a strong first 9 months to the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pretax profit to be about $10.2 billion and, again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000. And just kind of bringing it all together, if you go to Slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever, as I mentioned. But that's following a third quarter that was better than expected but lower than a year ago, as we guided. 
We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see as a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S. and, of course, uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit. 
Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong. And we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. 
And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our road map to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans to performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and, of course, our parts business, transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed, and that includes luxury, small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.

A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on industry volume. We're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, we've got the ability to react to that. So we'll be very flexible on that. In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling. And if anything, there could be potentially some risk on the sterling given how weak it became following the Tory conference and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So we saw a little bit of exposure, but we're comfortable right now with that $600 million. If you look at Asia Pacific in terms of what's happening with pricing, in the year-to-date, the industry's down about 6%. And the best we can tell, we're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate. We talked about that in the second quarter. We saw that continue to moderate in the third. And the third quarter industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%. And sequentially, I think it was down about 1, 1.3 points. So we are seeing a decline of -- the pace of the decline in pricing, and we've built that into our outlook. Do you want to add anything to that?"

And we know you're aware, and it's in your interest, and you want to do it. I guess the question for you is, how much on a per unit basis as -- you talked to Raj's team and your suppliers. How much would it take, putting aside the fully autonomous robo stuff, to make a real dent in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian safety? Like per car, are we talking -- to make accidents like 1/3 less likely for your new vehicles, is it hundreds of dollars a car? Is it $1,000? Or is it several thousands? Just high level, Mark.

To your question around the fatalities, that's why we're so bullish on autonomous vehicles and, as you know, the societal and safety benefits that can have from that. But let's face it, I haven't seen the data yet. But if you really want to improve vehicle safety, you take people's phones away from them so they can't text while they're driving because I have a feeling that a lot of the increase on that has to do with that. Now we -- our approach on that is through our SYNC system, allow people to do it, rather than touching their phones, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel. And that's our approach. But it's an interesting question but one in which I can't give you an exact answer."

So I mean, I'm asking because I remember that the F-150 launch, it went better than expected, right, with cost to produce being a little bit less, and that was one of the drivers of upside in 2015.

It came up very well. The quality is good coming out of the plant. We -- the suppliers are performing well. We do have an issue on one supplier that's trying to keep with -- up with us on demand, and we're working with them on that. But as our usual process, we'll launch, settle the plant down, and that's where the teams -- once we get to the launch levels and the plant is stable, that's when we really start going to town on looking at, are there ways of getting more efficient in terms of the productivity on the line but also material costs? In terms of 2017, we're going to continue to follow that pattern. In terms of impacts, as Bob has mentioned, when you look at the margins on the new Super Duty, they are lower than the previous one, and that's because it's the first time we've redone the product in 18 years.

It's just -- the thing that you just got to keep in mind, Ryan, I think this is a different conversation than in Japan or Indonesia, is the external environment is sort of similar to Russia and South America. This is an environment that's been affected by the commodity cycle. It's been very affected by oil, particularly in the Middle East. It's been affected to some extent by geopolitical issues. So I think it's a different conversation and discussion. I think we'll end up with much better results in the fourth quarter based on what we see today.
