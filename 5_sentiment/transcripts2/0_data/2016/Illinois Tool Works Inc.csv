Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute on our enterprise strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. 
In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our business structure simplification, sourcing and 80/20 excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017. 
In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda. And we made meaningful progress, with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready to grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continued to execute the various elements of our enterprise strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. And we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael and then I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?"

EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7%, and our self-help Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.
Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance, with some fairly challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends was stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.
Turning to revenue by geography on Page 5. Let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes a 1 percentage point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. 
By geography, North America was down 1.6%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 2% and the industrial business is down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6% with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%. Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment.
Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China Automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall stable end market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against the fairly challenging comparisons. 
On Page 6, strong operating margin performance once again in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7% improved 110 basis points and 4 segments improved between 220 and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help Enterprise Initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable 30 basis points. The strong progress on operating margin, and as Scott said, while trying to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.
On Page 7, we listed full year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the enterprise strategy.
Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM. Another strong quarter. Organic revenue up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organic in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4% and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus '15.
Solid quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.
Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4%, and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, health care and lodging. International equipment was up 4% and continued strong demand in warewash, cooking and refrigeration.
Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%. Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and again, some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. 
North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore. But as we talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant stepdown in demand in Q1 last year, followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3 and then in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3.  Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.
On Slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top and bottom line. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2%, with high single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7% due to Australia. In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat with solid growth in consumer packaging, offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points to 23%.
Turning to Slide 11. As you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio. And in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer facing. As you can see in a tough environment, our consumer businesses: Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. And the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.
Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally-adjusted sequential trends from Q3 to Q4, revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, we would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It's maybe too early to call this a trend but certainly an encouraging data point as we look ahead.
Quickly on 2015. You can see that we continued to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics: EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital, increased cash flow all reflect the strength of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.
Going back a little bit further to the launch of the enterprise strategy on Slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR and solid progress in our [indiscernible] As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in the ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. In summary, over the last 3 years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do, and we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact. In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives, independent of volume and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%. Earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, a 6% growth at the midpoint and 10% growth, excluding currencies.
Turning to the first quarter. Our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full year earnings, right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. And based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.
Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the 2 recent developments and then I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year 7. 
In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system. And we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year 5. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months. And based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016, with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.
Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently access $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott."

And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are hoping on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM s",624,"Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are hoping on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. 
As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in the space. We are essentially a high-velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers. This segment had in 2015 had $2.5 billion of revenue, 8% organic growth and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. 
As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in the space, with ITW's very focused niche positioning and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last 4, 5 years as we talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points, on average, since 2012. 
So the addition of the ZF -- the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions. On Slide 18, a very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus. This business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components, largely focused on the interior of the car. Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.
On Slide 18, in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics to the product platforms that we support today. Certainly, a very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents. 
And from a standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia so it supplements our position in Asia. Overall business is from a standpoint of revenue by geography is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific so very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America, so gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, the last point is we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first 5 years of ownership.
From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly onetime [ph] sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion. Certainly modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all noncash acquisition accounting-related costs. Certainly expect to generate returns on capital well within our target over the first 7 to 10 years of the acquisition. 
Michael talked about our ability to fund 70% or so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash. This is an acquisition from a strategic and operational in the standpoint we would have done with [indiscernible] funding sources but certainly the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost. The ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here but not -- didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of -- or this first half of 2016. 
So with that, I think we're -- that's all for our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we're not counting on improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. We're based on current run rates, we are -- in that range of 1% to 3%. I think the -- in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control in terms of our self-help. And number one on the list are the Enterprise Initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last 3 years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume from those in '16. If you translate that into EPS as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth. Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is depending on the timing as offset by recent currency moves, not so much in the euro but primarily in Canadian, Australian dollars, the pound. But it does give us a little bit of room here. So overall in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range. And we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter, and just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we would expect that to continue in 2016."

Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario essentially is for a 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and are in the 2.5% to 3% range. So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we've talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-à-vis we've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold 2 and 3 years ago. So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on -- in terms of what our expectations are for 2016 with respect to auto build into our plans. It doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection or some change in overall builds, relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact but ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set whether there's an appropriate level of conservatism and have enough new penetration, new content in '16 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of pending any sort of major crash, which I don't anybody thinks is going to happen.

The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow to ready to grow. It's largely a lot of 80/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus and a lot of -- as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where the best opportunities to grow. So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda's pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company from the prepared to grow to ready to grow, just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B, and in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less agenda. And we're working our way through the rest. So I don't think there's much impact in terms of external environment. In terms of that, the objective that we have laid out to get 80% -- 85% of our business is in that mode by the end of this year. That being said, certainly, the external environment from the standpoint of yield on that investment is certainly going to have an impact in the short run. A little bit of tailwind at some point here could be certainly -- would certainly help us showcase the progress we're making. But I think also make the other point that the fact that we're able to grow 45% of our sales in this environment at a 6% clip in 2015 is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard."

Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute on our enterprise strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. 
In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our business structure simplification, sourcing and 80/20 excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017. 
In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda and we made meaningful progress, with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continued to execute the various elements of our enterprise strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. And we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?"

EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7%, and our self-help Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.
Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some fairly challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends was stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in the Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. 
In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.
Turning to revenue by geography on Page 5. Let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes 1-percentage-point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. 
By geography, North America was down 1.6%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6%, with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%. Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment.
Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China Automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against the fairly challenging comparisons. 
On Page 6, strong operating margin performance, once again, in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7% improved 110 basis points and 4 segments improved between 220 and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help Enterprise Initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. The strong progress on operating margin, and as Scott said, while trying to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.
On Page 7, we listed full year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the enterprise strategy.
Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM. Another strong quarter. Organic revenue, up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organic in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4%, and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus '15.
Solid quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.
Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4%, and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, health care and lodging. International equipment was up 4% and continued strong demand in warewash, cooking and refrigeration.
Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific, up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%. Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and again, some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. 
North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore. But as we talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant stepdown in demand in Q1 last year, followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.
On Slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top and bottom line. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2%, with high single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7%, due to Australia. 
In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat with solid growth in consumer packaging, offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points to 23%.
Turning to Slide 11. As you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio. And in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer-facing. As you can see in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.
Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trends from Q3 to Q4, revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, we would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It maybe too early to call this a trend but certainly an encouraging data point as we look ahead.
Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continued to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics: EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital, increased cash flow all reflect the strength of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.
Going back a little bit further to the launch of the enterprise strategy on Slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR and solid progress in our pillar to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in the ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. 
In summary, over the last 3 years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do, and we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact. In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%. Earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, a 6% growth at the midpoint and 10% growth excluding currencies.
Turning to the first quarter. Our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full year earnings, right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. And based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.
Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the 2 recent developments, and then I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year 7. 
In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system. And we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year 5. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016 with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.
Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently access $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott."
280561,321446545,921622,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM",629,"Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. 
As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in the space. We are essentially a high-velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers. This segment had -- in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue, 8% organic growth and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. 
As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in the space within ITW's very focused niche positioning and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last 4, 5 years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points, on average, since 2012. 
So the addition of the ZF -- the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions. On Slide 18, a very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus. This business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components, largely focused on the interior of the car. Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong, solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.
On Slide 18, in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. Certainly, a very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents. And from a standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is -- from a standpoint of revenue by geography is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific. So very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America so it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, the last point is, we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first 5 years of ownership.
From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly onetime sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion. Certainly modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all noncash acquisition accounting-related costs. Certainly expect to generate returns on capital well within our target over the first 7 to 10 years of the acquisition. 
Michael talked about our ability to fund 70%-or-so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash. This is an acquisition from a strategic and operational in the turn standpoint that we would have done without the funding sources but certainly the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost. The ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here but not -- it didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of -- or this first half of 2016. 
So with that, I think we're -- that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we're not counting on a improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. We're based on current run rates. We are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%. I think the -- that the -- in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control in terms of our self-help, and number one on the list are the Enterprise Initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last 3 years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume, from those in '16. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth. 
Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is depending on the timing as offset by recent currency moves, not so much in the euro but primarily in Canadian, Australian dollars, the pound. But it does give us a little bit of room here. So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range. And we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter, and just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016."

Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario essentially is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range. So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we've talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-à-vis we've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold 2 and 3 years ago. So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on -- in terms of what our expectations are for 2016 with respect to auto built into our plans. Now it doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection and -- or some change in overall builds, relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact. But ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set where there's an appropriate level of conservatism and have enough new penetration, new content in '16 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of pending any sort of major crash, which I don't anybody thinks is going to happen.

The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow into ready-to-grow. It's largely a lot of 80/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus and a lot of, as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow. So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda's pretty well-mapped-out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow, just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B, and in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less agenda, and we're working our way through the rest. So I don't think there's much impact in terms of the external environment.

In other words, do you have -- and I realize you've got a little bit of a backlog look-forward, but are there initiatives that you're working on that may be derivative of, say, CAFI [ph] standards or vehicle electrification? Or you're working on a big something in Indonesia or something like that, that you think maybe give you -- maybe not dramatically, but like a point or 2 of step-up health over the coming cycle?"

So I think we have a very solid view of the next 10 years in this space in terms of what the opportunities are for our particular niche in this space. And I think that's -- this is not a -- this is not -- we don't manage anything of our businesses for the next 2 quarters. We manage them for the long haul.

Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute on our enterprise strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. 
In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our business structure simplification, sourcing and 80/20 excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017. 
In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda and we made meaningful progress, with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continued to execute the various elements of our enterprise strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth, with best-in-class margins and returns. And we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?"

EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7%, and our self-help Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.
Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some fairly challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in the Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. 
In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.
Turning to revenue by geography, on Page 5. Let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes 1-percentage-point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6%, with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. 
By geography, North America was down 1.6%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6%, with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%. Our consumer businesses grew 4.6%, with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment.
Asia-Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China Automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison. 
On Page 6, strong operating margin performance, once again, in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7% improved 110 basis points and 4 segments improved between 220 and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help Enterprise Initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. So strong progress on operating margin and, as Scott said, we'll trying to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.
On Page 7, we listed full year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the enterprise strategy.
Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM. Another strong quarter. Organic revenue, up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organic in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4%, and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus '15.
Solid quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.
Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4%, and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, health care and lodging. International equipment was up 4% and continued strong demand in warewash, cooking and refrigeration.
Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia-Pacific, up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%. Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and, again, some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. 
North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas, primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore. But as we talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant stepdown in demand in Q1 last year, followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.
On Slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2%, with high single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat and commercial was down slightly. Asia-Pacific was strong, up 7%, due to Australia. 
In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat, with solid growth in consumer packaging offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points to 23%.
Turning to Slide 11. As you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio. And in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer-facing. As you can see in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.
Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trends from Q3 to Q4, revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, we would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It may be too early to call this a trend but certainly an encouraging data point as we look ahead.
Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continued to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics: EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital and free cash flow all reflect the strengths of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.
Going back a little bit further to the launch of the enterprise strategy, on Slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR and solid progress in our pillar to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in the ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. 
In summary, over the last 3 years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do, and we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact. In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%. Earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, with 6% growth at the midpoint and 10% growth excluding currencies.
Turning to the first quarter. Our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full year earnings, right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. And based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.
Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the 2 recent developments, and then I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year 7. 
In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system. And we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year 5. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016, with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.
Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently access $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott."
280561,321446545,921693,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM",628,"Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. 
As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in this space. We are essentially a high-velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers. This segment had -- in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue, 8% organic growth and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. 
As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in the space within ITW's very focused niche positioning and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last 4 or 5 years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points, on average, since 2012. 
So the addition of the ZF -- the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions. On Slide 18, a very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus. This business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components, largely focused on the interior of the car. Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong, solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.
On Slide 18, in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. Certainly, a very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents. And from a standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is -- from a standpoint of revenue by geography is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia-Pacific. So very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America so it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, the last point is, we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first 5 years of ownership.
From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly 1x sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion. Certainly modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all noncash acquisition accounting-related costs. Certainly expect to generate returns on capital well within our target over the first 7 to 10 years of the acquisition. 
Michael talked about our ability to fund 70%-or-so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash, which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done without the funding sources but certainly the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost, the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here but not -- it didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of -- or this first half of 2016. 
So with that, I think we're -- that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we're not counting on an improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. We're based on current run rates. We are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%. I think the -- that the -- in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control in terms of our self-help, and number one on the list are the Enterprise Initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last 3 years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume, from those in '16. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth. 
Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is, depending on the timing, is offset by recent currency moves, not so much in the euro but primarily in Canadian, Australian dollars, the pound. But it does give us a little bit of room here. So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range. And we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter, and just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016."

Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario essentially is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range. So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we've talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-à-vis we've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold 2 and 3 years ago. So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on -- in terms of what our expectations are for 2016 with respect to auto built into our plans. Now it doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection and -- or some change in overall builds, relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact. But ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set, where there's an appropriate level of conservatism and have enough new penetration and new content in '16 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of -- pending any sort of major crash, which I don't anybody thinks is going to happen.

So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda's pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow. It's just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B, and in some cases, we had further to go than others.

And we're starting to see the deflation come through on some of the key raw materials that we're buying. In some cases, we pass those on to customers. We're contractually obligated, so I'll assume we'll do that. But there is a little bit more of a -- certainly an improvement in the overall equation here in the fourth quarter.

In 2015,",316,"Thanks, Aaron, and good morning. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute on our enterprise strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. 
In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our business structure simplification, sourcing and 80/20 excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017. 
In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda and we made meaningful progress, with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continued to execute the various elements of our enterprise strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. And we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?"

EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7%, and our self-help Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.
Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some fairly challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in the Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. 
In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.
Turning to revenue by geography on Page 5. Let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes 1-percentage-point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. 
By geography, North America was down 1.6%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6%, with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%. Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment.
Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China Automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison. 
On Page 6, strong operating margin performance, once again, in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7% improved 110 basis points and 4 segments improved between 220 and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help Enterprise Initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. So strong progress on operating margin and, as Scott said, we'll trying to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.
On Page 7, we listed full year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the enterprise strategy.
Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM. Another strong quarter. Organic revenue, up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organic in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4%, and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus '15.
Solid quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.
Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4%, and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, health care and lodging. International equipment was up 4% and continued strong demand in warewash, cooking and refrigeration.
Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific, up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%. Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and, again, some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. 
North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore. But as we talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant stepdown in demand in Q1 last year, followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.
On Slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2%, with high single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7%, due to Australia. 
In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat with solid growth in consumer packaging offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points to 23%.
Turning to Slide 11. As you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio. And in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer-facing. As you can see in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.
Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trends from Q3 to Q4, revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, we would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It may be too early to call this a trend but certainly an encouraging data point as we look ahead.
Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continued to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics: EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital and free cash flow all reflect the strengths of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.
Going back a little bit further to the launch of the enterprise strategy on Slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR and solid progress in our pillar to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in the ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. 
In summary, over the last 3 years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do, and we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact. In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%. Earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, with 6% growth at the midpoint and 10% growth excluding currencies.
Turning to the first quarter. Our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full year earnings, right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. And based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.
Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the 2 recent developments, and then I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year 7. 
In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system. And we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year 5. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016 with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.
Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently access $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott."
280561,321446545,921777,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM",629,"Thanks, Michael. And just now a couple of words on our -- the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On Slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are bolting on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. 
As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in this space. We are essentially a high-velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers. This segment had -- in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue, 8% organic growth and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. 
As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in the space within ITW's very focused niche positioning and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last 4 or 5 years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points, on average, since 2012. 
So the addition of the ZF -- the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions. On Slide 18, a very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus. This business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components, largely focused on the interior of the car. Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong, solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.
On Slide 18, in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. Certainly, a very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents. And from a standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is -- from a standpoint of revenue by geography is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific. So very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America so it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, the last point is, we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first 5 years of ownership.
From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly 1x sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion. Certainly modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all noncash acquisition accounting-related costs. Certainly expect to generate returns on capital well within our target over the first 7 to 10 years of the acquisition. 
Michael talked about our ability to fund 70%-or-so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash, which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done without the funding sources but certainly the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost, the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here but not -- it didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of -- or this first half of 2016. 
So with that, I think we're -- that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we're not counting on an improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. We're based on current run rates. We are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%. I think the -- that the -- in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control in terms of our self-help, and number one on the list are the Enterprise Initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last 3 years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume, from those in '16. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth. Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is, depending on the timing, is offset by recent currency moves, not so much in the euro but primarily in Canadian, Australian dollars, the pound. But it does give us a little bit of room here. So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range. And we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter, and just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016."

Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario essentially is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range. So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we've talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-à-vis we've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold 2 and 3 years ago. So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on -- in terms of what our expectations are for 2016 with respect to auto built into our plans. Now it doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection and -- or some change in overall builds, relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact. But ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest.

I think you've hit a -- in terms of those 3 areas of the company, I think you've hit 3 that are still in the preparing-to-grow mode. The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow into ready-to-grow. It's largely a lot of 80/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus and a lot of, as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow. So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda's pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow. It's just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B, and in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less agenda, and we're working our way through the rest. So I don't think there's much impact in terms of the external environment. In terms of that -- the objective that we have laid out to get 80% -- 85% of our businesses in that mode by the end of this year, that being said, certainly, the external environment from the standpoint of yield on that investment is certainly going to have an impact in the short run. The -- a little bit of tailwind at some point here would be certainly -- would certainly help us showcase the progress we're making. But I think the -- I'd also make the other point that the fact that we're able to grow 45% of our sales in this environment at a 6% clip in 2015 is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard."

And so if you -- let's take Welding to maybe illustrate this. So if you look at the sequential demand trends in Welding, what we saw in the first quarter was a 8% decline in the demand rate. And in the second quarter and into the third quarter, we saw 1% decline, all seasonally adjusted. And then in the fourth quarter, we saw flat. And so that means that we would expect typical seasonality in Welding. We expect that business to be up 2% and -- to be down 2% and the business was actually up -- to be down 2% and the business was flat, sorry.

Overall, a pretty good solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. 
In the quarter, we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our POS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased after-tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company.
Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current event trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint. 
Before turning the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q1 results, I'd like to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. Michael, over to you."

As you saw this morning, ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings. GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04, driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our Enterprise Initiatives. 
Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and international declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 basis points, with Strategic Sourcing, 80/20 Practice Excellence and business structure simplification all contributing in a very meaningful way. Given the strong margin performance in the quarter, we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year.
Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were $1.3 billion higher than this quarter. 
After-tax ROIC was solid. Free cash flow was strong. And we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just to comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. 
That said, let me just point out 2 items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29: first, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption, an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year; second, last year's first quarter included a nonrecurring gain on the sale of a business. As a result in the first quarter last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these 2 items, EPS would have increased 13%.
We strongly believe that in current economic environment and over the long term, our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is a core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios.
Our consumer-facing businesses make up 60% of our revenues and include the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments as well as portions of Specialty Products and construction. These businesses continue to deliver stable, high-quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer-facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1% sequentially. 
Our industrial-facing businesses such as Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics account for 40% of our revenues, and as expected, they declined year-over-year. As you can see, these businesses were down 3% but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know, the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year.
1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2% with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in Food Equipment up 5%, Automotive up 4% and construction products with renovation remodeling up 22%. 
Industrial-facing businesses were down 3%, with Welding down 7% and Test & Measurement and Electronics down 1%. On the international side, overall down 1% with Europe up 1% and Asia Pac down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial is down 4%, primarily due to Welding.
In ITW, we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business's competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is, in our view, a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. 
In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% as 6 of our 7 segments improved. Construction Products increased 440 basis points, Specialty Products 350 basis points, Food Equipment up 190 basis points and Automotive was up 140 basis points, to mention a few. Approximately half of the decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items, and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment, as evidenced by the ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue.
You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense for what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up. On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter, starting with 130 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. Given the strong performance and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives this year.
Price/cost came in as expected, stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution in Enterprise Initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably.
Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013, 520 basis point at the enterprise level. As you can see, construction improved 930 basis points, 780 basis points in Food Equipment and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products. Overall, good progress with more to come.
Turning to the segments. Automotive OEM had another strong quarter with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we've seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, the segment had a very tough comp, and Q1 revenue came in right where we planned it to be. 
In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus build of 2%, which is what created the tough comp for the business this year. Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above-market growth annually, and based on already sold programs and our new program pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond.
In North America, 4% organic growth compares to auto build of up 5% and the Detroit 3 up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact that builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected, operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4%, the highest in the company. 
A quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close midyear. As a reminder, EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, with accelerating benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Another strong quarter in Food Equipment, up 3% organically with strength in North America up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America equipment was up 5%, with strength in refrigeration and cooking and service was up 4%. International was up 1%, with equipment up 3% and service flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%. Test & Measurement down 3% and Electronics slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially, the segment was stable, down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%.
Still a challenging external environment for our Welding business as organic revenue declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 7%, with equipment down 10% and consumables down 1%. International was down 15%, primarily due to oil and gas. 
We saw some slowing sequentially with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase, and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier, approximately half of the operating margin decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items.
Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%. North America and international were both up 1% and Automotive Aftermarket improved 2%.
Strong quarter in Construction Products as organic revenue increased 5%, with North America up 11%. Renovation remodeling was up 22%, commercial was up 8% and residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe flat. Very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 21%.
Solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue up 3%, with strength in our consumer packaging businesses. North America was up 5% and international was flat. And very strong progress on operating margin with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%.
So for the year, based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60, the $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue  growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates. 
We're forecasting that Enterprise Initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100%, and we're targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. 
For the second quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast in the first half of the year, which is consistent with prior years. And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron."

Hopefully, we're getting close to a bottom but I can't say that we're seeing anything that tells us that.

If you look at the progression that we laid out and we talked about this, early on, we were heavily focused on the portfolio business structure simplification. Sourcing, we said all along, had a ramp. If you remember that, I think it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation. And then we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence. It's reapplying the ITW business model to the much more focused businesses. And so what we're seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the later stage stuff. So it wasn't necessarily an all-at-once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives. They were very intentionally laid out in a sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next phase things. So some of the improvement that we're seeing is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing, I would say, is you're starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as was in to make the pivot to growth and Michael showed you a chart earlier but if you look at where we had the best margin performance in the quarter, it was in the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth. So the elevated level of profitability in incremental profit we generate, every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategies."

And it will not be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we will talk about anymore, won't have a significant impact at some point. It is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B. It's not something that we can just -- we just stop selling something. So it does take some work, and it's a process attached to it but I would expect that, that number in '17 will be lower than it was in '16. And certainly by the end of '17, that should be a nonfactor. On the first part of your question, we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are -- I can't give you a number for how many across of the transition line from preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow in the first quarter, but we've got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year-end. And at that point, those businesses start to change their focus to grow, I would certainly note that it's not necessarily something where we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately, what it means is a significant part of their organizational energy and effort, 75%-plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential. And from that, we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses.

Overall, a pretty solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our PLS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased the after-tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company.
Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint.
Before turning the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q1 results, I'd like to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. Michael, over to you."

As you saw this morning, ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings. GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04, driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our Enterprise Initiatives.
Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and International declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 points, with Strategic Sourcing, 80/20 Practice Excellence and business structure simplification, all contributing in a very meaningful way. Given the strong margin performance in the quarter, we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year.
Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were $1.3 billion higher than this quarter. 
After-tax ROIC was solid, free cash flow was strong, and we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just to comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number, and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. 
That said, let me just point out 2 items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29. First, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption, an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year. Second, last year's first quarter included a nonrecurring gain on the sale of a business. As a result, in the first quarter last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these 2 items, EPS would have increased 13%.
We strongly believe that in current economic environment and over the long term, our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is a core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios.
Our consumer-facing businesses make up 60% of our revenues and include the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments as well as portions of Specialty Products and Construction. These businesses continue to deliver stable, high-quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer-facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Our industrial-facing businesses, such as Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics account for 40% of our revenues, and as expected, they declined year-over-year. As you can see, these businesses were down 3% but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know, the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year.
1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in Food Equipment, up 5%; Automotive, up 4%; and Construction products with Renovation/Remodeling, up 22%. 
Industrial-facing businesses were down 3%, with Welding down 7% and Test & Measurement and Electronics down 1%. On the international side, overall, down 1% with Europe, up 1% and Asia Pac, down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial is down 4%, primarily due to Welding.
In ITW, we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business's competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is, in our view, a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. 
In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% as 6 of our 7 segments improved. Construction Products increased 440 basis points; Specialty Products, 350 basis points; Food Equipment, 190 basis points; and Automotive was up 140 basis points, to mention a few. Approximately half of the decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items, and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment, as evidenced by the ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue.
You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense of what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up. On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter, starting with 130 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. Given the strong performance and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives this year.
Price/cost came in as expected, stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably.
Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013: 520 basis point at the enterprise level; as you can see, Construction improved 930 basis points; 780 basis points in Food Equipment; and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products. Overall, good progress with more to come.
Turning to the segments. Automotive OEM had another strong quarter, with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we've seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, the segment had a very tough comp, and Q1 revenue came in right where we planned it to be. 
In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus build of 2%, which is what created the tough comp for the business this year. Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above-market growth annually, and based on already sold programs and our new program pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond.
In North America, 4% organic growth compares to auto build of up 5% and the Detroit 3, up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact that builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected, operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4%, the highest in the company. 
A quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close midyear. As a reminder, EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, with accelerating benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Another strong quarter in Food Equipment, up 3% organically, with strength in North America, up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America Equipment was up 5%, with strength in Refrigeration and Cooking and Service was up 4%. International was up 1%, with equipment, up 3% and service, flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%. Test & Measurement, down 3% and Electronics, slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially, the segment was stable, down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%.
Still a challenging external environment for our Welding business as organic revenue declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 7%, with equipment, down 10% and consumables, down 1%. International was down 15%, primarily due to oil and gas. 
We saw some slowing sequentially, with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase, and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier, approximately half of the operating margin decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items.
Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%. North America and International were both up 1% and Automotive Aftermarket improved 2%.
Strong quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 5%, with North America up 11%. Renovation/Remodeling was up 22%, Commercial was up 8% and Residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe. Flat. Very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 21%.
Solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue up 3%, with strength in our consumer packaging businesses. North America was up 5% and international was flat. And very strong progress on operating margin, with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%.
So for the year, based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60. The $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue  growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates. 
We're forecasting that Enterprise Initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100%, and we're targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. 
For the second quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast in the first half of the year, which is consistent with prior years. 
And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron."

Hopefully, we're getting close to a bottom, but I can't say that we're seeing anything that tells us that.

If you look at the progression that we laid out, and we've talked about this, as early on, we were heavily focused on the portfolio business structure simplification. Sourcing, we said all along, had a ramp. If you remember that, I think it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation. And then, we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence. It's reapplying the ITW business model to the scaled up, much more focused businesses. And so what we're seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the later stage stuff. So it wasn't necessarily an all-at-once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives. They were very intentionally laid out in a sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next-phase things. So some of the improvement that we're seeing is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing that I would say is you're starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we're starting to make the pivot to growth. And Michael showed you a chart earlier, but if you look at where we had the best margin performance in the quarter, it was in the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth. So the elevated level of profitability and the incremental profit we generated, and every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategy."

I think we are -- frankly, we're -- there's still a fair amount of that to do heading into '16. We won't know what that looks like for '17 fully until we get to the end of the planning cycle, but I would say we're certainly moving in the direction of getting to the tail end of that. And it will not be -- there'll be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we'll talk about anymore. It won't have a significant impact at some point. It is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B. It's not something that we can just -- we just stop selling something. So it does take some work, and there's a process attached to it. But I would expect that, that number in '17 will be lower than it was in '16. And certainly, by the end of '17, that should be a nonfactor. On the first part of your question, we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are -- I can't give you a number for how many cross of the transition line from preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow in the first quarter, but we've got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year-end. And at that point, those businesses start to change their focus to growth, I would certainly note that it's not necessarily something what we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately, what it means is that a significant part of their organizational energy and effort, 75%-plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential. And from that, we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses.

We use, obviously, at the quarterly level -- they move around, so there's -- we're not going to forward forecast where currency is going to be. Michael's comment was if everything stayed exactly where it was, 2 comments that I'll repeat. One is that we're impacted by more than just the euro. Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, also reasonably material factors as is the pound.

Overall, a pretty solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our PLS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased the after-tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company.
Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint.

As you saw this morning, ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings. GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04, driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our Enterprise Initiatives.
Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and International declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 points, with Strategic Sourcing, 80/20 Practice Excellence and business structure simplification, all contributing in a very meaningful way. Given the strong margin performance in the quarter, we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year.
Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were $1.3 billion higher than this quarter. 
After-tax ROIC was solid, free cash flow was strong, and we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just to comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number, and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. 
That said, let me just point out 2 items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29. First, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption, an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year. Second, last year's first quarter included a nonrecurring gain on the sale of a business. As a result, in the first quarter last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these 2 items, EPS would have increased 13%.
We strongly believe that in current economic environment and over the long term, our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is a core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios.
Our consumer-facing businesses make up 60% of our revenues and include the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments as well as portions of Specialty Products and Construction. These businesses continue to deliver stable, high-quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer-facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Our industrial-facing businesses, such as Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics account for 40% of our revenues, and as expected, they declined year-over-year. As you can see, these businesses were down 3% but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know, the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year.
1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in Food Equipment, up 5%; Automotive, up 4%; and Construction products with Renovation/Remodeling, up 22%. 
Industrial-facing businesses were down 3%, with Welding down 7% and Test & Measurement and Electronics down 1%. On the international side, overall, down 1% with Europe, up 1% and Asia Pac, down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial is down 4%, primarily due to Welding.
In ITW, we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business's competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is, in our view, a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. 
In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% as 6 of our 7 segments improved. Construction Products increased 440 basis points; Specialty Products, 350 basis points; Food Equipment, 190 basis points; and Automotive was up 140 basis points, to mention a few. Approximately half of the decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items, and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment, as evidenced by the ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue.
You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense of what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up. On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter, starting with 130 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. Given the strong performance and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives this year.
Price/cost came in as expected, stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably.
Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013: 520 basis point at the enterprise level; as you can see, Construction improved 930 basis points; 780 basis points in Food Equipment; and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products. Overall, good progress with more to come.
Turning to the segments. Automotive OEM had another strong quarter, with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we've seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, the segment had a very tough comp, and Q1 revenue came in right where we planned it to be. 
In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus build of 2%, which is what created the tough comp for the business this year. Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above-market growth annually, and based on already sold programs and our new program pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond.
In North America, 4% organic growth compares to auto builds of up 5% and the Detroit 3, up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact that builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected, operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4%, the highest in the company. 
A quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close midyear. As a reminder, EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, with accelerating benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Another strong quarter in Food Equipment, up 3% organically, with strength in North America, up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America Equipment was up 5%, with strength in Refrigeration and Cooking and Service was up 4%. International was up 1%, with equipment up 3% and service flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%. Test & Measurement down 3% and Electronics slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially the segment was stable, down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%.
Still a challenging external environment for our Welding business as organic revenue declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 7%, with equipment, down 10% and consumables, down 1%. International was down 15%, primarily due to oil and gas. 
We saw some slowing sequentially, with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase, and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier, approximately half of the operating margin decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items.
Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%. North America and International were both up 1% and Automotive Aftermarket improved 2%.
Strong quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 5%, with North America up 11%. Renovation/Remodeling was up 22%, Commercial was up 8% and Residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe. Flat. Very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 21%.
Solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue up 3%, with strength in our consumer packaging businesses. North America was up 5% and international was flat. And very strong progress on operating margin, with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%.
So for the year, based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60. The $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue  growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates. 
We're forecasting that Enterprise Initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100%, and we're targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. 
For the second quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast in the first half of the year, which is consistent with prior years. 
And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron."

If you look at the progression that we laid out, and we've talked about this, as early on we were heavily focused on the portfolio business structure simplification. Sourcing, we said all along, had a ramp. If you remember that, I think it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation. And then, we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence. It's reapplying the ITW business model to the scaled up, much more focused businesses. And so what we're seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the later stage stuff. So it wasn't necessarily an all-at-once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives. They were very intentionally laid out in a sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next-phase things. So some of the improvement that we're seeing is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing that I would say is you're starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we're starting to make the pivot to growth. And Michael showed you a chart earlier, but if you look at where we had the best margin performance in the quarter, it was in the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth. So the elevated level of profitability and the incremental profit we generated, and every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategy."

And it will not be -- there'll be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we'll talk about anymore. It won't have a significant impact at some point. It is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B. It's not something that we can just -- we just stop selling something. So it does take some work, and there's a process attached to it. But I would expect that, that number in '17 will be lower than it was in '16. And certainly, by the end of '17, that should be a nonfactor. On the first part of your question, we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are -- I can't give you a number for how many cross the transition line from preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow in the first quarter, but we've got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year-end. And at that point, those businesses start to change their focus to growth, I would certainly note that it's not necessarily something what we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately, what it means is that a significant part of their organizational energy and effort, 75%-plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential. And from that, we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses.

The -- with respect to the balance of the year, Michael talked about it before, the currency is -- there's no win in trying to forecast where currency goes.

Overall, a pretty solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continued to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our PLS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased the after-tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company.
Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint.
Before turning the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q1 results, I'd like to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. Michael, over to you."

As you saw this morning, ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings. GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04, driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our Enterprise Initiatives.
Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and International declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 points, with Strategic Sourcing, 80/20 Practice Excellence and business structure simplification, all contributing in a very meaningful way. Given the strong margin performance in the quarter, we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year.
Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were $1.3 billion higher than this quarter. 
After-tax ROIC was solid, free cash flow was strong, and we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just to comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number, and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. 
That said, let me just point out 2 items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29. First, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption, an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year. Second, last year's first quarter included a nonrecurring gain on the sale of a business. As a result, in the first quarter last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these 2 items, EPS would have increased 13%.
We strongly believe that in current economic environment and over the long term, our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is a core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios.
Our consumer-facing businesses make up 60% of our revenues and include the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments as well as portions of Specialty Products and Construction. These businesses continue to deliver stable, high-quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer-facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Our industrial-facing businesses, such as Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics account for 40% of our revenues, and as expected, they declined year-over-year. As you can see, these businesses were down 3% but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know, the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year.
1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in Food Equipment, up 5%; Automotive, up 4%; and Construction products with Renovation/Remodeling, up 22%. 
Industrial-facing businesses were down 3%, with Welding down 7% and Test & Measurement and Electronics down 1%. On the international side, overall, down 1% with Europe, up 1% and Asia Pac, down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial is down 4%, primarily due to Welding.
In ITW, we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business's competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is, in our view, a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. 
In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% as 6 of our 7 segments improved. Construction Products increased 440 basis points; Specialty Products, 350 basis points; Food Equipment, 190 basis points; and Automotive was up 140 basis points, to mention a few. Approximately half of the decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items, and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment, as evidenced by the ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue.
You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense of what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up. On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter, starting with 130 basis points from our self-help Enterprise Initiatives. Given the strong performance and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives this year.
Price/cost came in as expected, stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably.
Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013: 520 basis point at the enterprise level; as you can see, Construction improved 930 basis points; 780 basis points in Food Equipment; and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products. Overall, good progress with more to come.
Turning to the segments. Automotive OEM had another strong quarter, with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we've seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, the segment had a very tough comp, and Q1 revenue came in right where we planned it to be. 
In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus build of 2%, which is what created the tough comp for the business this year. Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above-market growth annually, and based on already sold programs and our new program pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond.
In North America, 4% organic growth compares to auto builds of up 5% and the Detroit 3, up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact that builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected, operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4%, the highest in the company. 
A quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close midyear. As a reminder, EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, with accelerating benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Another strong quarter in Food Equipment, up 3% organically, with strength in North America, up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America Equipment was up 5%, with strength in Refrigeration and Cooking and Service was up 4%. International was up 1%, with equipment up 3% and service flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%. Test & Measurement down 3% and Electronics slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially the segment was stable, down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%.
Still a challenging external environment for our Welding business as organic revenue declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 7%, with equipment, down 10% and consumables, down 1%. International was down 15%, primarily due to oil and gas. 
We saw some slowing sequentially, with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase, and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier, approximately half of the operating margin decline in Welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items.
Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%. North America and International were both up 1% and Automotive Aftermarket improved 2%.
Strong quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 5%, with North America up 11%. Renovation/Remodeling was up 22%, Commercial was up 8% and Residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe. Flat. Very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 21%.
Solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue up 3%, with strength in our consumer packaging businesses. North America was up 5% and international was flat. And very strong progress on operating margin, with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%.
So for the year, based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60. The $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates. 
We're forecasting that Enterprise Initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100%, and we're targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. 
For the second quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast in the first half of the year, which is consistent with prior years. 
And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron."

Hopefully, we're getting close to a bottom, but I can't say that we're seeing anything that tells us that. But beyond that, the overall demand profile inside the company was pretty solid as we moved through the quarter, so no big movement and certainly, not any weakening as we moved through the quarter."

If you look at the progression that we laid out, and we've talked about this, as early on we were heavily focused on the portfolio business structure simplification. Sourcing, we said all along, had a ramp. If you remember that, I think it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation. And then, we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence. It's reapplying the ITW business model to the scaled up, much more focused businesses. And so what we're seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the later stage stuff. So it wasn't necessarily an all-at-once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives. They were very intentionally laid out in a sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next-phase things. So some of the improvement that we're seeing is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing that I would say is you're starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we're starting to make the pivot to growth. And Michael showed you a chart earlier, but if you look at where we had the best margin performance in the quarter, it was in the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth.

So how many more businesses, or even should we be thinking like this, did you convert in 1Q as ready-to-grow? And when you do convert these, are you seeing the growth progression of those businesses that you expect? And you still have a percentage fluid headwind on growth on PLS in the quarter. I think you thought about 90 bps for the year. How does that progression work out? Does it start falling -- does the headwind start falling significantly just at the very end of the year, or does it start falling now?"

I think we are -- frankly, we're -- there's still a fair amount of that to do heading into '16. We won't know what that looks like for '17 fully until we get into the planning cycle, but I would say we're certainly moving in the direction of getting to the tail end of that. And it will not be -- there'll be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we'll talk about anymore. It won't have a significant impact at some point. It is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B. It's not something that we can just -- we just stop selling something. So it does take some work, and there's a process attached to it. But I would expect that, that number in '17 will be lower than it was in '16. And certainly, by the end of '17, that should be a nonfactor. On the first part of your question, we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are -- I can't give you a number for how many cross the transition line from preparing-to-grow to ready-to-grow in the first quarter, but we've got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year-end. And at that point, those businesses start to change their focus to growth, I would certainly note that it's not necessarily something what we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately, what it means is that a significant part of their organizational energy and effort, 75%-plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential. And from that, we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses. I think we've already shown that in places like Food Equipment and Automotive that have been the furthest ones down the path."

EPS of $1.46 was up 12% year-on-year and came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.04 from better margins, $0.01 from slightly higher revenue and $0.02 from nonoperating items largely related to our minority ownership interest in our former Decorative Surfaces segment.
Operating income of $792 million was up 8% year-on-year and was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margins of 23.1% were up 180 basis points, and after-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points to 22.9%, both of which were all-time records for the company. 
As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction in the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continue to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead.
I'm also pleased with the progress that we are making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth, excluding PLS impact of 2% at the enterprise level, was pretty solid in this environment, particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our Welding segment in the quarter. 
All 6 of our other segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of Welding and PLS impacts, organic growth for our 6 other segments combined was 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment. 
A couple of final comments before I turn the call back to Michael. First, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW. This is a great addition to the company and I would like to publicly welcome the 3,500-plus members of the EF&C team to ITW. And second, I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Michael?"
280561,366818577,1008477,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings and solid execution and improving growth performance and many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to",1927,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings and solid execution and improving growth performance and many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.
Organic revenue was up 2% gross, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Group progress in Q2 with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth, with Welding the only exception. And in Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically. 
Consumer-facing businesses were up 3%, industrial-facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On a regional basis, North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%. 
A comment on the U.K. which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2, our U.K. sales were up 2%, with no signs of a slowdown. And in our opinion, it is too early to tell what the longer-term impact from Brexit may be, but at current FX rates, the weakening of the British pound is modestly unfavorable, which is factored into our updated guidance.
As Scott mentioned, we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics. Operating margin of 23.1%, up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion, with price/cost and volume leverage and other contributing to the remaining 60 basis points. We grew operating income 8% to $792 million, making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history.
After-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also a new all-time record at 22.9%. We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to net income conversion was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. 
In the second quarter, we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half, bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion, with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $800 million from normal surplus cash flow.
In the second quarter, ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time. And we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page, starting with 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. Price/cost came in as expected, modestly favorable, 20 basis points. And volume leverage and other contributed the balance.
Continued strong margin expansion across the company with Construction Products up 440 basis points to 24.3%. Food Equipment up 300 basis points to 25%, Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%.
Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring. And in Welding, despite 140 basis points of restructuring impact this quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak to trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid-20s. This performance over a pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model.
Turning to the segment discussion and starting with Automotive OEM. Another solid quarter with organic revenue up 4% against a tough comparison last year as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America, 3% organic growth, Europe was up 8% and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall builds were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier.
Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 5% organically, with broad-based strength in the equipment side, including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite a tough comparison, with equipment up 9%, driven by end market demand, in K-12, lodging, health care and retail and service was up 1%. International was up 3%, with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from Enterprise Initiatives improved operating margin by 300 basis points to 25%.
Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 3%. The Electronics platform grew 6% due to end market strength in solar and semiconductor. We've talked about the margin expansion potential in this segment before, and we are pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition-related noncash amortization charges, which [indiscernible] over time. 
Declines in Welding demand continued in Q2 with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter, with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas; 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture infrastructure and mining; and 1 point from commercial.
North America was down 8%, with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21% again due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels, year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9%, which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact.
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth up 2% as this segment continues its growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last 3-plus years. On a regional basis, North America was up 1% and international was up 3%.
Approximately half of this segment revenues are related to Automotive Aftermarket, which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as Fluids improved 1% and Polymers was flat. Overall, margins were unchanged at 20.9%, which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact. As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition-related noncash amortization charges.
Another solid quarter in Construction Products as organic revenue increased 3%. North America was down 1%, with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year. Renovation/Remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter. And in the quarter, North America -- in North America, commercial was up 5% and residential up 1%. And overall, we feel like we're exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective. 
On the last call, we talked about quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, Renovation/Remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand, which are pretty solid.
Asia Pacific was up 7% due to Australia. Europe was up 6%, driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again, very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 24.3%. Finally, another solid quarter in Specialty Products with organic revenue flat. Solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on our operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%.
Turning to EF&C. We are very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know, in the Automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we've demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we can continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years.
We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional Automotive OEM and customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. 
For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle. Specifically, EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all, it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. And on a regional basis, with its global strategically-located manufacturing facilities, it is very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, we continue to see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we're confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate at a minimum over the next 5 years. EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team, with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. 
From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than 1x [ph] sales and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is $220 million to $240 million of revenues so $110 million to $120 million in Q3 and in Q4. 
From a margin standpoint, EF&C is dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after-tax ROIC and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C, we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year-to-date. Including EF&C, we're maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%.
From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting-related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we're confident that we can generate after-tax returns in the mid- to high teens by year 7.
Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. 
We expect that demand remains stable at current levels, and as a result, we are narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging unexpected market conditions in Welding. Consistent with prior forecast, our guidance include approximately 1 percentage point of PLS impact. So excluding PLS, we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. 
Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy as we exit slower growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW caliber margins.
As I said earlier, our operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. And finally, for the third quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52, assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief. [Operator Instructions]"

So I don't -- but at the same token, we're performing better, our margins were certainly offsetting -- more than offsetting the impact that Welding's having on the short term, and that's one of the values of a portfolio of 7 really strong businesses is we're never probably going to have all 7 going 100% in the right direction all at the same time, but we're going to have enough of them around the overall enterprise performance in whatever environment, this is going to be pretty darn good."

Overall, we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continued to execute well and, as a result, delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company. EPS of $1.46",413,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall, we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continued to execute well and, as a result, delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company. EPS of $1.46 was up 12% year-on-year and came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.04 from better margins, $0.01 from slightly higher revenue and $0.02 from nonoperating items largely related to our minority ownership interest in our former Decorative Surfaces segment.
Operating income of $792 million was up 8% year-on-year and was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margins of 23.1% were up 180 basis points, and after-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points to 22.9%, both of which were all-time records for the company. 
As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction in the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continued to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead.
I am also pleased with the progress that we are making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth, excluding PLS impact of 2% at the enterprise level, was pretty solid in this environment, particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our Welding segment in the quarter. 
All 6 of our other segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of Welding and PLS impacts, organic growth for our 6 other segments combined was 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment.

This is a great addition to the company, and I would like to publicly welcome the 3,500-plus members of the EF&C team to ITW. And second, I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continued to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. 
Michael?"
280561,366818577,1008623,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $",1929,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.
Organic revenue was up 2% gross, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Good progress in Q2, with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth, with Welding the only exception. And in Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically. 
Consumer-facing businesses were up 3%, industrial-facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On a regional basis, North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%. 
A comment on the U.K., which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2, our U.K. sales were up 2%, with no signs of a slowdown. And in our opinion, it is too early to tell what the longer-term impact from Brexit may be, but at current FX rates, the weakening of the British pound is modestly unfavorable, which is factored into our updated guidance.
As Scott mentioned, we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics. Operating margin of 23.1%, up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion, with price/cost and volume leverage and other contributing to the remaining 60 basis points. We grew operating income 8% to $792 million, making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history.
After-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also a new all-time record at 22.9%. We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to a net income conversion that was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. 
In the second quarter, we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half, bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion, with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $800 million from normal surplus cash flow. 
In the second quarter, ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time. And we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page, starting with 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. Price/cost came in as expected, modestly favorable, 20 basis points; and volume leverage and other contributed the balance.
Continued strong margin expansion across the company, with Construction Products up 440 basis points to 24.3%; Food Equipment up 300 basis points to 25%; Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points; and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%.
Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring. And in Welding, despite 140 basis points of restructuring impact this quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak-to-trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid-20s. This performance over a pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model.
Turning to the segment discussion, and starting with Automotive OEM. Another solid quarter, with organic revenue up 4% against a tough comparison last year, as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America, 3% organic growth. Europe was up 8%, and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall builds were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier.
Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 5% organically, with broad-based strength on the equipment side, including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite a tough comparison, with equipment up 9%, driven by end-market demand in K-12 [ph], lodging, health care and retail, and service was up 1%. International was up 3%, with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from Enterprise Initiatives improved operating margin by 300 basis points to 25%.
Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 3%. The Electronics platform grew 6% due to end-market strength in solar and semiconductor. We've talked about the margin expansion potential in this segment before, and we are pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition-related, noncash amortization charges, which will beat up over time. 
Declines in Welding demand continued in Q2, with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter, with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas; 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture infrastructure and mining; and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 8%, with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21%, again, due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels, year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9%, which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact.
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 2%, as this segment continues its pivot to growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last 3-plus years. On a regional basis, North America was up 1% and international was up 3%.
Approximately half of the segment revenues are related to Automotive Aftermarket, which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as Fluids improved 1% and Polymers was flat. Overall margins were unchanged at 20.9%, which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact. As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition-related noncash amortization charges.
Another solid quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 3%. North America was down 1%, with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year. Renovation/Remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter. And in the quarter, North America -- in North America, commercial was up 5% and residential up 1%. And overall, we feel like we're exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective. 
On the last call, we talked about how quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, Renovation/Remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand, which are pretty solid.
Asia Pacific was up 7% due to Australia. Europe was up 6%, driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again, very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 24.3%. 
Finally, another solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue flat. Solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%.
Turning to EF&C. We are very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know, in the Automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we've demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we can continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years.
We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional Automotive OEM and tier [ph] customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. 
For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle. Specifically, EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all, it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. And on a regional basis, with its global, strategically located manufacturing facilities, it is very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, we continue to see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we're confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate, at a minimum, over the next 5 years. EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team, with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. 
From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than 1x sales, and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is $220 million to $240 million of revenues, so $110 million to $120 million in Q3 and in Q4. 
From a margin standpoint, EF&C is dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after-tax ROIC, and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C, we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year-to-date. Including EF&C, we are maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%.
From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting-related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we're confident that we can generate after-tax returns in the mid- to high teens by year 7.
Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. 
We expect that demand remains stable at current levels, and as a result, we're narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging-than-expected market conditions in Welding. Consistent with prior forecast, our guidance includes approximately 1 percentage point of PLS impact. So excluding PLS, we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. 
Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy as we exit slower-growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW-caliber margins.
As I said earlier, our operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. And finally, for the third quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52, assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief. [Operator Instructions]"

What -- you've done a fantastic job, and you -- clearly, I think people see the flex in your business model, but I can't imagine you're complacent, right?

I think right now, and it's certainly reflected in our Q2 results, we're not seeing anything yet. It's obviously very early. But I think, overall, I don't really see any difference between sort of the kind of contingency planning we would do around the whole Brexit situation and any other contingency planning that we would do relative to global macroeconomic conditions generally in whatever region of the world. The -- from an M&A standpoint, the goal, I would say and I'd go back to what we've talked about repeatedly, which is the primary focus of the company right now, is that we've got a collection, in our view, of terrific assets and our primary focus is operating the assets we already have to the best of our ability. And there's certainly more runway to go in terms of getting to our -- from where we are to what we view as our full potential.

So just trying to pinpoint, where are those particular end businesses that, at least, you kind of see as their attitude's going to change a bit '16 going into '17, it's been building toward it? Just so I can kind of track that progression as we exit '16 into '17. Are there some businesses you would, at least, highlight? Let's get -- outside of auto and food, right, those are already pretty far along. Welding's obviously got some macro issues, maybe those comps ease, but can you just help us a little bit to flesh it out for our own fieldwork?"

So lots of opportunity to add those categories to the existing categories we have.

Overall, we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continued to execute well and, as a result, delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company. EPS of $1.46",413,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall, we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continued to execute well and, as a result, delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company. EPS of $1.46 was up 12% year-on-year and came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.04 from better margins, $0.01 from slightly higher revenue and $0.02 from nonoperating items largely related to our minority ownership interest in our former Decorative Surfaces segment.
Operating income of $792 million was up 8% year-on-year and was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margins of 23.1% were up 180 basis points, and after-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points to 22.9%, both of which were all-time records for the company. 
As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction in the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continued to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead.
I am also pleased with the progress that we are making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth, excluding PLS impact of 2% at the enterprise level, was pretty solid in this environment, particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our Welding segment in the quarter. 
All 6 of our other segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of Welding and PLS impacts, organic growth for our 6 other segments combined was 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment. 
A couple of final comments before I turn the call back to Michael. First, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW. This is a great addition to the company, and I would like to publicly welcome the 3,500-plus members of the EF&C team to ITW. And second, I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continued to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. 
Michael?"
280561,366818577,1008758,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $",1928,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.
Organic revenue was up 2% gross, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Good progress in Q2, with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth, with Welding the only exception. And in Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically. 
Consumer-facing businesses were up 3%, industrial-facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On a regional basis, North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%. 
A comment on the U.K., which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2, our U.K. sales were up 2%, with no signs of a slowdown. And in our opinion, it is too early to tell what the longer-term impact from Brexit may be, but at current FX rates, the weakening of the British pound is modestly unfavorable, which is factored into our updated guidance.
As Scott mentioned, we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics. Operating margin of 23.1%, up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion, with price/cost and volume leverage and other contributing to the remaining 60 basis points. We grew operating income 8% to $792 million, making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history.
After-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also a new all-time record at 22.9%. We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to a net income conversion that was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. 
In the second quarter, we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half, bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion, with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $800 million from normal surplus cash flow. 
In the second quarter, ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time. And we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page, starting with 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. Price/cost came in as expected, modestly favorable, 20 basis points; and volume leverage and other contributed the balance.
Continued strong margin expansion across the company, with Construction Products up 440 basis points to 24.3%; Food Equipment up 300 basis points to 25%; Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points; and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%.
Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring. And in Welding, despite 140 basis points of restructuring impact this quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak-to-trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid-20s. This performance over a pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model.
Turning to the segment discussion, and starting with Automotive OEM. Another solid quarter, with organic revenue up 4% against a tough comparison last year, as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America, 3% organic growth. Europe was up 8%, and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall builds were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier.
Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 5% organically, with broad-based strength on the equipment side, including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite a tough comparison, with equipment up 9%, driven by end-market demand in K-12, lodging, health care and retail, and service was up 1%. International was up 3%, with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from Enterprise Initiatives improved operating margin by 300 basis points to 25%.
Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 3%. The Electronics platform grew 6% due to end-market strength in solar and semiconductor. We've talked about the margin expansion potential in this segment before, and we are pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition-related, noncash amortization charges, which will bleed off [ph] over time. 
Declines in Welding demand continued in Q2, with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter, with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas; 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture infrastructure and mining; and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 8%, with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21%, again, due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels, year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9%, which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact.
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 2%, as this segment continues its pivot to growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last 3-plus years. On a regional basis, North America was up 1% and international was up 3%.
Approximately half of the segment revenues are related to Automotive Aftermarket, which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as Fluids improved 1% and Polymers was flat. Overall margins were unchanged at 20.9%, which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact. As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition-related noncash amortization charges.
Another solid quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 3%. North America was down 1%, with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year. Renovation/Remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter. And in the quarter, North America -- in North America, commercial was up 5% and residential up 1%. And overall, we feel like we're exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective. 
On the last call, we talked about how quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, Renovation/Remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand, which are pretty solid.
Asia-Pacific was up 7% due to Australia. Europe was up 6%, driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again, very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 24.3%. 
Finally, another solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue flat. Solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%.
Turning to EF&C. We are very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know, in the Automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we've demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we can continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years.
We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional Automotive OEM and tier [ph] customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. 
For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle. Specifically, EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all, it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. And on a regional basis, with its global, strategically located manufacturing facilities, it is very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, we continue to see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we're confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate, at a minimum, over the next 5 years. EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team, with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. 
From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than 1x sales, and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is $220 million to $240 million of revenues, so $110 million to $120 million in Q3 and in Q4. 
From a margin standpoint, EF&C is dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after-tax ROIC, and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C, we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year-to-date. Including EF&C, we are maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%.
From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting-related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we're confident that we can generate after-tax returns in the mid- to high teens by year 7.
Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. 
We expect that demand remains stable at current levels, and as a result, we're narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging-than-expected market conditions in Welding. Consistent with prior forecasts, our guidance includes approximately 1 percentage point of PLS impact. So excluding PLS, we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. 
Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy as we exit slower-growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW-caliber margins.
As I said earlier, our operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. And finally, for the third quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52, assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief. [Operator Instructions]"

I think right now, and it's certainly reflected in our Q2 results, we're not seeing anything yet. It's obviously very early. But I think, overall, I don't really see any difference between sort of the kind of contingency planning we would do around the whole Brexit situation and any other contingency planning that we would do relative to global macroeconomic conditions generally in whatever region of the world. The -- from an M&A standpoint, I think all I would say and I'd go back to what we've talked about repeatedly, which is the primary focus of the company right now, is that we've got a collection, in our view, of terrific assets and our primary focus is operating the assets we already have to the best of our ability. And there's certainly more runway to go in terms of getting to our -- from where we are to what we view as our full potential.

Just so I can kind of track that progression as we exit '16 into '17. Are there some businesses you would, at least, highlight?

As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction in the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continued to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead.
I am also pleased with the progress that we are making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth, excluding PLS impact of 2% at the enterprise level, was pretty solid in this environment, particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our Welding segment in the quarter. 
All 6 of our other segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of Welding and PLS impacts, organic growth for our 6 other segments combined was 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment. 
A couple of final comments before I turn the call back to Michael. First, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW. This is a great addition to the company, and I would like to publicly welcome the 3,500-plus members of the EF&C team to ITW. And second, I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continued to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. 
Michael?"

Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $",1928,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Once again, ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings, and solid execution in improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.
Organic revenue was up 2% gross, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Good progress in Q2, with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth, with Welding the only exception. And in Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically. 
Consumer-facing businesses were up 3%, industrial-facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On a regional basis, North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%. 
A comment on the U.K., which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2, our U.K. sales were up 2%, with no signs of a slowdown. And in our opinion, it is too early to tell what the longer-term impact from Brexit may be, but at current FX rates, the weakening of the British pound is modestly unfavorable, which is factored into our updated guidance.
As Scott mentioned, we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics. Operating margin of 23.1%, up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion, with price/cost and volume leverage and other contributing to the remaining 60 basis points. We grew operating income 8% to $792 million, making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history.
After-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also a new all-time record at 22.9%. We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to a net income conversion that was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. 
In the second quarter, we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half, bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion, with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $800 million from normal surplus cash flow. 
In the second quarter, ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time. And we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page, starting with 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. Price/cost came in as expected, modestly favorable, 20 basis points; and volume leverage and other contributed the balance.
Continued strong margin expansion across the company, with Construction Products up 440 basis points to 24.3%; Food Equipment up 300 basis points to 25%; Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points; and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%.
Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring. And in Welding, despite 140 basis points of restructuring impact this quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak-to-trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid-20s. This performance over a pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model.
Turning to the segment discussion, and starting with Automotive OEM. Another solid quarter, with organic revenue up 4% against a tough comparison last year, as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America, 3% organic growth. Europe was up 8%, and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall builds were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier.
Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 5% organically, with broad-based strength on the equipment side, including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite a tough comparison, with equipment up 9%, driven by end-market demand in K-12, lodging, health care and retail, and service was up 1%. International was up 3%, with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from Enterprise Initiatives improved operating margin by 300 basis points to 25%.
Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 3%. The Electronics platform grew 6% due to end-market strength in solar and semiconductor. We've talked about the margin expansion potential in this segment before, and we are pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition-related, noncash amortization charges, which will bleed off [ph] over time. 
Declines in Welding demand continued in Q2, with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter, with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas; 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture infrastructure and mining; and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 8%, with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21%, again, due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels, year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9%, which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact.
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 2%, as this segment continues its pivot to growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last 3-plus years. On a regional basis, North America was up 1% and international was up 3%.
Approximately half of the segment revenues are related to Automotive Aftermarket, which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as Fluids improved 1% and Polymers was flat. Overall margins were unchanged at 20.9%, which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact. As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition-related noncash amortization charges.
Another solid quarter in Construction Products, as organic revenue increased 3%. North America was down 1%, with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year. Renovation/Remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter. And in the quarter, North America -- in North America, commercial was up 5% and residential up 1%. And overall, we feel like we're exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective. 
On the last call, we talked about how quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, Renovation/Remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand, which are pretty solid.
Asia-Pacific was up 7% due to Australia. Europe was up 6%, driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again, very strong progress in operating margin, up 440 basis points to 24.3%. 
Finally, another solid quarter in Specialty Products, with organic revenue flat. Solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%.
Turning to EF&C. We are very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know, in the Automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we've demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we can continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years.
We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional Automotive OEM and tier [ph] customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. 
For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle. Specifically, EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all, it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platforms that we support today. And on a regional basis, with its global, strategically located manufacturing facilities, it is very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. 
And certainly, we continue to see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we're confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate, at a minimum, over the next 5 years. EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team, with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. 
From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than 1x sales, and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is $220 million to $240 million of revenues, so $110 million to $120 million in Q3 and in Q4. 
From a margin standpoint, EF&C is dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after-tax ROIC, and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C, we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year-to-date. Including EF&C, we are maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%.
From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting-related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we're confident that we can generate after-tax returns in the mid- to high teens by year 7.
Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. 
We expect that demand remains stable at current levels, and as a result, we're narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging-than-expected market conditions in Welding. Consistent with prior forecasts, our guidance includes approximately 1 percentage point of PLS impact. So excluding PLS, we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. 
Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy as we exit slower-growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW-caliber margins.
As I said earlier, our operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. And finally, for the third quarter, our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52, assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief. [Operator Instructions]"

The -- from an M&A standpoint, I think all I would say and I'd go back to what we've talked about repeatedly, which is the primary focus of the company right now, is that we've got a collection, in our view, of terrific assets and our primary focus is operating the assets we already have to the best of our ability. And there's certainly more runway to go in terms of getting to our -- from where we are to what we view as our full potential.

It's more of an acceleration over time as more of the divisions inside each segment make that transition. I am -- my view is that we have -- our second quarter results certainly reflect solid progress in the right direction, and you can -- we will -- we expect it to continue to improve quarter by quarter. But it's not a matter of -- as I said, it's not a matter of flipping the switch and going from no focus on growth to all in with both feet."

Just so I can kind of track that progression as we exit '16 into '17. Are there some businesses you would, at least, highlight?

In the quarter, we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1%, which if you exclude the 80 basis points of the EF&C acquisition dilution, was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis, and after tax return on invested capital came in at 23%.  The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. 
In addition, we are continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with 6 of our 7 segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging. Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last 4 years with almost no help from the market environment.  But we still I believe, have to go [ph] before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW's full performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and our updated Q4 2016 forecast. Michael?"

ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and that",1437,"Thank you, Scott. ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and that result in [ph] better margin performance.  
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%, and organic growth was 2%, in line with guidance. 
Overall demand was pretty steady-state as we moved through the quarter in what continues to be a fairly challenging environment, particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, 6 of 7 segments delivered positive organic growth, and key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, including China, were all positive.
In my opinion, the highlight this quarter was ITW's record operating margin performance of 23.1%, 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all 7 segments performing above 21%. Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW. 
We invested more than $150 million in capital equipments, new project -- products and projects to simplify our businesses. Free cash flow of 101% of net income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing, but year-to-date, we're on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%.  In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year's program with another $500 million in Q4, bringing the total to $2 billion. 
Finally, as you saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%. So overall, a pretty straightforward good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results. 
On Slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance. The strong execution on our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price/cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company, and like I said, 23.9% if you're comparing to our long-term performance goal of 23%-plus. 
On Page 6, really good operating performance across the 7 segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever. I wanted to point out that Automotive OEM margins, as expected, were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C, and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25%-plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter. 
Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our Automotive OEM. A really good quarter on the top line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region. In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to auto builds of 2%, and that includes a 1% decline at the so-called D3 [ph] where we have relatively higher content. 
Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter. Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year, making for a relatively easy comparison. 
Food Equipment was up 1% organically, with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%. Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect the Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment.  Also, continued strong margin performance as 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. 
A good quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter, this segment was down 11%. 
Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we've talked about on this call before. Margin improved 440 basis points to 21%, with 190 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage. 
While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining, and then 2 points from commercial. 
The brighter story is on the margin front as the Welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle while preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around. Despite peak to trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which is only 150 basis points below peak margins.  In the third quarter, benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion. 
As we've said before, our Welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1%, mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21%, driven by initiatives and restructuring savings. 
Demand in Construction Products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2. And in this quarter, commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4% and residential was down slightly 1 point. [ph] 
Asia Pacific was up 2%. Europe was pretty good, up 2%, but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6%, respectively. And we talked about the margins, 24.5% in Construction if you exclude the European certification project this quarter. 
Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue essentially flat, with international up 3% and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly, offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side. Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1%, driven by 180 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives. 
Turning to Page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. 
As you saw this morning, we are raising the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to $5.56 to $5.66, which represents 9% earnings growth at the midpoint. As usual, we're assuming current foreign exchange rates, which given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the euro, creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, the full year guidance increase of $0.01 is essentially the $0.03 peak [ph] from the third quarter, partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today's foreign exchange rates. 
We expect full year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full year record for the company, and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates, which equates to organic growth of 0% to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady-state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3.
We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5%, which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C, which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year. So continued strong margin expansion in Q4. 
Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41, which is 11% earnings growth at the midpoint, marking a pretty strong finish to the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open up the call to your questions."

In Q3, ITW delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings growth with record operating income, operating margin and return on invested capital performance. In the quarter, we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1%, which if you exclude the 80 basis points of the EF&C acquisition dilution, was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis, and after tax return on invested capital came in at 23%.  The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. 
In addition, we are continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with 6 of our 7 segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging. Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last 4 years with almost no help from the market environment.  But we still have a ways to go before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW's full performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December.

ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and the",1433,"Thank you, Scott. ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and the resulting better margin performance.  
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%, and organic growth was 2%, in line with guidance. 
Overall demand was pretty steady-state as we moved through the quarter in what continues to be a fairly challenging environment, particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, 6 of 7 segments delivered positive organic growth, and key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, including China, were all positive.
In my opinion, the highlight this quarter was ITW's record operating margin performance of 23.1%, 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all 7 segments performing above 21%. Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW. 
We invested more than $150 million in capital equipments, new project -- products and projects to simplify our businesses. Free cash flow of 101% of net income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing, but year-to-date, we're on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%.  In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year's program with another $500 million in Q4, bringing the total to $2 billion. 
Finally, as you saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%. So overall, a pretty straightforward good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results. 
On Slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance. The strong execution on our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price/cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company, and like I said, 23.9% if you're comparing to our long-term performance goal of 23%-plus. 
On Page 6, really good operating performance across the 7 segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever. I wanted to point out that Automotive OEM margins, as expected, were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C, and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25%-plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter. 
Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our Automotive OEM. A really good quarter on the top line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region. In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to auto builds of 2%, and that includes a 1% decline at the so-called D3 ph] where we have relatively higher content. 
Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter. Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year, making for a relatively easy comparison. 
Food Equipment was up 1% organically, with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%. Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect the Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment.  Also, continued strong margin performance as 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. 
A good quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter, this segment was down 11%. 
Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we've talked about on this call before. Margin improved 440 basis points to 21%, with 190 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage. 
While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining, and then 2 points from commercial. 
The brighter story is on the margin front as the Welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle while preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around. Despite peak to trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which is only 150 basis points below peak margins.  In the third quarter, benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion. 
As we've said before, our Welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1%, mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21%, driven by initiatives and restructuring savings. 
Demand in Construction Products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2. And in this quarter, commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4% and residential was down slightly 1 point. 
Asia Pacific was up 2%. Europe was pretty good, up 2%, but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6%, respectively. And we talked about the margins, 24.5% in Construction if you exclude the European certification project this quarter. 
Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue essentially flat, with international up 3% and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly, offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side. Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1%, driven by 180 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives. 
Turning to Page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. 
As you saw this morning, we are raising the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to $5.56 to $5.66, which represents 9% earnings growth at the midpoint. As usual, we're assuming current foreign exchange rates, which given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the euro, creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, the full year guidance increase of $0.01 is essentially the $0.03 peak from the third quarter, partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today's foreign exchange rates. 
We expect full year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full year record for the company, and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates, which equates to organic growth of 0% to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady-state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3.
We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5%, which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C, which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year. So continued strong margin expansion in Q4. 
Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41, which is 11% earnings growth at the midpoint, marking a pretty strong finish to the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open up the call to your questions."

And I would say, as with all of our 7 businesses, they are, in terms of the work they've done moving through these enterprise strategy initiatives, they all started in a different place. They all had their own level of work to be done, and in Test & Measurement's case, there are recent progress in terms of outcome is noteworthy, but they've been doing things inside that haven't necessarily showed up in terms of margin for the last 6 or 8 quarters. And so I'm very pleased with, now, what's starting to show up, but they've been on a pretty good track all the way along in terms of what they've been working on to get where they can be, and as you said, still have more room to go."

So while this was -- this particular activity was known, we knew we were going to have to do it almost back to the beginning, it's one where we also are now at a place from the standpoint of timing where we're in a position to do it and do it in a way that doesn't impact our ability to serve our customers in the region.

We fully expect we'll be at above 100% for the year, which would imply a strong Q4, which, seasonally, that's what we usually do. So other than that, feel very good about the free cash flow performance. And on the Construction side, I'd just add, similar to what we said earlier, I mean, demand is pretty steady state. There's some comp issues that we're dealing with, but we feel good about the -- using current run rates to model the fourth quarter and we're not expecting any big changes from where we are right now."

In Q3, ITW delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings growth with record operating income, operating margin and return on invested capital performance. In the quarter, we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1%, which if you exclude the 80 basis points of the EF&C acquisition dilution, was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis, and after tax return on invested capital came in at 23%.  The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. 
In addition, we are continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with 6 of our 7 segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging. Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last 4 years with almost no help from the market environment.  But we still have a ways to go before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW's full performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and our updated Q4 2016 forecast. Michael?"

ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and the resulting better margin performance.  
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%, and organic growth was 2%, in line with guidance. 
Overall demand was pretty steady-state as we moved through the quarter in what continues to be a fairly challenging environment, particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, 6 of 7 segments delivered positive organic growth, and key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, including China, were all positive.
In my opinion, the highlight this quarter was ITW's record operating margin performance of 23.1%, 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all 7 segments performing above 21%. Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW. 
We invested more than $150 million in capital equipments, new project -- products and projects to simplify our businesses. Free cash flow of 101% of net income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing, but year-to-date, we're on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%.  In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year's program with another $500 million in Q4, bringing the total to $2 billion. 
Finally, as you saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%. So overall, a pretty straightforward good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results. 
On Slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance. The strong execution on our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price/cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company, and like I said, 23.9% if you're comparing to our long-term performance goal of 23%-plus. 
On Page 6, really good operating performance across the 7 segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever. I wanted to point out that Automotive OEM margins, as expected, were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C, and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25%-plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter. 
Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our Automotive OEM. A really good quarter on the top line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region. In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to auto builds of 2%, and that includes a 1% decline at the so-called D3 where we have relatively higher content. 
Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter. Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year, making for a relatively easy comparison. 
Food Equipment was up 1% organically, with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%. Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect the Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment.  Also, continued strong margin performance as 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. 
A good quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter, this segment was down 11%. 
Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we've talked about on this call before. Margin improved 440 basis points to 21%, with 190 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage. 
While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas; 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining; and then 2 points from commercial. 
The brighter story is on the margin front as the Welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle while preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around. Despite peak-to-trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which is only 150 basis points below peak margins.  In the third quarter, benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion. 
As we've said before, our Welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1%, mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21%, driven by initiatives and restructuring savings. 
Demand in Construction Products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2. And this quarter, commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4% and residential was down slightly 1 point. 
Asia Pacific was up 2%. Europe was pretty good, up 2%, but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6%, respectively. And we talked about the margins, 24.5% in Construction if you exclude the European certification project this quarter. 
Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue essentially flat, with international up 3% and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly, offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side. Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1%, driven by 180 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives. 
Turning to Page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. 
As you saw this morning, we are raising the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to $5.56 to $5.66, which represents 9% earnings growth at the midpoint. As usual, we're assuming current foreign exchange rates, which, given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the euro, creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, the full year guidance increase of $0.01 is essentially the $0.03 peak from the third quarter, partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today's foreign exchange rates. 
We expect full year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full year record for the company, and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates, which equates to organic growth of 0% to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady-state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3.
We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5%, which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C, which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year. So continued strong margin expansion in Q4. 
Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41, which is 11% earnings growth at the midpoint, marking a pretty strong finish to the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open up the call to your questions."

And then maybe some larger payments that go out 1 quarter versus another. We fully expect we'll be at above 100% for the year, which would imply a strong Q4, which, seasonally, that's what we usually do. So other than that, feel very good about the free cash flow performance. And on the Construction side, I'd just add, similar to what we said earlier, I mean, demand is pretty steady state. There's some comp issues that we're dealing with, but we feel good about the -- using current run rates to model the fourth quarter and we're not expecting any big changes from where we are right now."

In Q3, ITW delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings growth with record operating income, operating margin and return on invested capital performance. In the quarter, we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1%, which if you exclude the 80 basis points of the EF&C acquisition dilution, was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis, and after tax return on invested capital came in at 23%. The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. 
In addition, we are continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with 6 of our 7 segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging. Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last 4 years with almost no help from the market environment. But we still have a ways to go before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW's full performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and our updated Q4 2016 forecast. Michael?"

ITW's third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50, slightly ahead of the midpoints of our guidance due to solid execution and the resulting better margin performance. 
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%, and organic growth was 2%, in line with guidance. 
Overall demand was pretty steady-state as we moved through the quarter in what continues to be a fairly challenging environment, particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, 6 of 7 segments delivered positive organic growth, and key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, including China, were all positive.
In my opinion, the highlight this quarter was ITW's record operating margin performance of 23.1%, 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all 7 segments performing above 21%. Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW. 
We invested more than $150 million in capital equipments, new project -- products and projects to simplify our businesses. Free cash flow of 101% of net income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing, but year-to-date, we're on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%. In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year's program with another $500 million in Q4, bringing the total to $2 billion. 
Finally, as you saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%. So overall, a pretty straightforward good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results. 
On Slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance. The strong execution on our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price/cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company, and like I said, 23.9% if you're comparing to our long-term performance goal of 23%-plus. 
On Page 6, really good operating performance across the 7 segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever. I wanted to point out that Automotive OEM margins, as expected, were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C, and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25%-plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter. 
Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our Automotive OEM. A really good quarter on the top line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region. In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to auto builds of 2%, and that includes a 1% decline at the so-called D3 where we have relatively higher content. 
Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter. Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year, making for a relatively easy comparison. 
Food Equipment was up 1% organically, with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%. Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect the Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment. Also, continued strong margin performance as 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. 
A good quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter, this segment was down 11%. 
Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we've talked about on this call before. Margin improved 440 basis points to 21%, with 190 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage. 
While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas; 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining; and then 2 points from commercial. 
The brighter story is on the margin front as the Welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle while preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around. Despite peak-to-trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which is only 150 basis points below peak margins. In the third quarter, benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion. 
As we've said before, our Welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth, up 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1%, mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21%, driven by initiatives and restructuring savings. 
Demand in Construction Products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2. And this quarter, commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4% and residential was down slightly 1 point. 
Asia Pacific was up 2%. Europe was pretty good, up 2%, but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6%, respectively. And we talked about the margins, 24.5% in Construction if you exclude the European certification project this quarter. 
Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue essentially flat, with international up 3% and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly, offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side. Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1%, driven by 180 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives. 
Turning to Page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. 
As you saw this morning, we are raising the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to $5.56 to $5.66, which represents 9% earnings growth at the midpoint. As usual, we're assuming current foreign exchange rates, which, given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the euro, creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, the full year guidance increase of $0.01 is essentially the $0.03 peak from the third quarter, partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today's foreign exchange rates. 
We expect full year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full year record for the company, and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year. 
For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates, which equates to organic growth of 0% to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady-state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3.
We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5%, which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C, which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year. So continued strong margin expansion in Q4. 
Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41, which is 11% earnings growth at the midpoint, marking a pretty strong finish to the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open up the call to your questions."

One, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned free cash flow, the free cash flow was a little light and it sounded like there was some timing issues. Can you just talk around that, sort of what the issues were and how much incremental that is to the fourth quarter? And then second, I guess when I looked at your Construction revenues on an organic basis, it's still up, but obviously, the increases are declining. So just a little color on your concern whether that market is turning at all in particular with the ABI data points that we're getting out, because commercial is also very strong within the Construction segment."

So there's -- things can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis. For example, our CapEx number is up a little bit this quarter, but year-to-date, it's exactly in line with last year. And then maybe some larger payments that go out 1 quarter versus another. We fully expect we'll be at above 100% for the year, which would imply a strong Q4, which, seasonally, that's what we usually do. So other than that, feel very good about the free cash flow performance. And on the Construction side, I'd just add, similar to what we said earlier, I mean, demand is pretty steady state. There's some comp issues that we're dealing with, but we feel good about the -- using current run rates to model the fourth quarter and we're not expecting any big changes from where we are right now."
