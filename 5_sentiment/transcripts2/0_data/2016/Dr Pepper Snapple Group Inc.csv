I'll start off this morning by saying, I'm proud of our teams for the strong performance they delivered. We remained focused on our priorities and delivered tremendous top and bottom line results. We grew both",1025,"Thanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I'll start off this morning by saying, I'm proud of our teams for the strong performance they delivered. We remained focused on our priorities and delivered tremendous top and bottom line results. We grew both dollar volume share in CSDs and shelf-stable juice. We executed a strong year-long calendar consumer relevant programming and launched several new products to meet consumer's evolving needs, such as our Snapple Straight Up Tea and Hawaiian Punch in pouch packaging. We also added new flavors to our sparkling water lineup and brought Peñafiel into several Hispanic markets in the U.S.
From a distribution and availability standpoint, we held ACV for CSDs in grocery and grew distribution of sparkling waters in that channel. We also grew ACV for Snapple Premium by about a point in both grocery and convenience. And in grocery, with redistribution of Mott single-serve juice just over 3 points. Our fountain team added over 42,000 new valves across local and national accounts, expanding single serve availability and creating new sampling locations for our brands. And finally, our improving RCI capabilities across the organization are driving improvements in growth and productivity. This past year, we introduced an RCI management framework we call DPS in Action starting with visual management across the company, and we'll build upon this framework in 2016.
Turning to the quarter. Bottler case sales increased 1% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD case sales were flat and non-carbs increased 4% in the quarter. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 2%. About half of this decline was driven by fountain foodservice in the quarter, as we lapped a fountain limited time offering in one of our larger accounts a year ago. We also continued to experience declines in diet for the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands also decreased 2% in the quarter. As a mid single-digit increase in candid dry was more than offset by a high single-digit increase in 7UP, a mid single-digit decrease in Sunkist and a low single-digit decrease in A&W. For the full year, Dr Pepper declined just under 1% and our Core 4 brands were flat, reflecting better than category performance across our key CSD brands. Crush grew 4% in the quarter and Schweppes increased 7% on distribution gains since sparkling waters and growth in the ginger ale category. Squirt increased 3% and Peñafiel grew 10% on increased promotional activity Tivoli and distribution gains.
All other CSDs declined 1% in the quarter. In non-carbs, Snapple increased 4% on distribution gains and the launch of our Straight Up Tea line. Hawaiian Punch increased 3% and Mott grew 2% in the quarter. Clamato increased 5% on distribution gains and increased promotional activity. And our water category grew 21% on strong growth in by brands, Fijian and our Aguafiel brand in Mexico. All other noncore brands declined 5% in the quarter.
As we move into 2016, our strategy of building brands, executing with excellence and continuing to embed RCI and lane management across the organization remains the same. This year, we'll unlock growth in our portfolio through focused communications and relevant product and packaging innovation across our priority brands that consumers have told us we can with. And we'll continue to use our improving marketing return on investment capabilities to provide better effectiveness on every dollar we spent. Execution is critical in this business. We will continue to work with our bottling partners to ensure priority been execution and Brian Dr Pepper. In our own DSD network, we'll continue to focus and execution excellence and driving distribution and availability across key brands and SKUs with added focus on high-margin channels like convenience and on premise.
Our strategy of partnering with select allied brand partners is contributing to our growth, and these partnerships are a great supplement to our own in-house innovation. These brands allow us to leverage our large-scale distribution network and participate in growth emerging categories where we don't currently have a brand presence.
And finally, we'll continue to evolve RCI into our daily management process. We'll further integrate go deployment of visual management across of the business, and we will continue to develop lean capabilities and venturing through our developing leader program, all to ensure we continue to build the best operating team in the industry. As I just said, building our brands is a key component of our strategy, and we've got some great plans in 2016 to drive excitement with our consumers, retail and bottling partners.
Dr Pepper returns to the big screen in March, partner with this year's blockbuster superhero movie, Batman versus Superman, driving activation of all our top retailers. We'll also bring back superstar, Little Sweet, in a new media campaign, continuing to highlight the great taste and sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. This summer, Dr Pepper's pick your Pepper will give millennials a unique way to express of the individuality with 150 one-of-a-kind labels to choose from. And in the fall, the brand once again dominate college football.
We'll feature several parrots of holiday themed activities throughout the year across our Core 4 brands, and we'll take advantage of the growing ginger ale and cherry segments with incremental media and retail activity behind Canada Dry, Cherry Dr Pepper and Cherry 7UP. We're also rolling up 7.5 pound slim cans across our core 4 portfolio and our company-owned DSD network to participate in this growth of the consumer prefer package. Snapple will continue to deliver new news to the category with 2 new seasonal LTos planned for later in the year and Straight Up Tea is getting a facelift with new graphics and 2 new varieties of green and herbal teas.
Mott's is partnering with Universal Pictures with Secret Life of Pets and will feature packaging with characters from the movie. And Clamato will share recipes for mixing locations on social media throughout the year as we take advantage of this brand strong mixer heritage.
I'm sure you'll agree, we've got a full calendar of activity plan for the year. Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,323553636,934616,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Larry.

Sales volume was flat with reported net sales up 2%. Currency neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin stood at 21.3%, up 200 basis points. Core EPS was up 14% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translations, core operating income was up 15% and core EPS was up 16%.
For the year, sales volumes were up 1% with reported net sales up 3%. Currency neutral net sales were up 5%. Core operating income was up 9%, yielding an operating margin of 20.9%, up 120 basis points from last year. Core EPS for the year was up 10%. 
Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 11% and core EPS was up 12% for the year. And without foreign currency transactions, these year-over-year growth rates would be even higher. All in all, some very good results for the quarter and the year. Now let me provide some further details on the quarter.
Contributing to our currency neutral net sales increase of 4% were favorable product, package and segment mix, along with increased price realization, net sales also benefited from lower discounts primarily in our fountain foodservice business as we lapped a higher trade accrual recorded last year. Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 20 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes.
Lower commodity cost increased gross margins by 150 basis points in the quarter and continued strong productivity benefits, including those from Rapid Continuous Improvement, increased gross margins by another 60 basis points. The impact of net pricing in the quarter increased gross margins by 50 basis points and decreases in other manufacturing cost increased gross margins by 10 basis points. Product, package and segment mix reduced gross margins by 110 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margin in the quarter by 60 basis points, as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $24 million on a favorable unrealized commodity mark-to-market effect of $21 million and a favorable comparison to a $14 million pension charge recorded last year. Foreign currency translation also reduced reported SG&A expense by $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in certain operating expenses. Increased management incentive compensation and an increase in marketing investments.
Depreciation and amortization declined $3 million in the quarter, reflecting recent trends in our capital spending efficiencies. We also recorded a $7 million impairment charge on our Garden Cocktail brand, which is included in other operating expense. Garden Cocktail is a vegetable juice sold in Canada. It's a fairly small volume brand that we continue to sell, but given recent decline in category trends and impairment was indicated.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million in the quarter, as we borrowed in November  to refinance these $500 million debt maturity in January. And our reported effective tax rate was 36.4% compared to 34.8% last year.
Now moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $991 million, down $31 million compared to last year. Capital spending was in line with our guidance at $179 million compared to $170 million last year, resulting in another strong year of free cash flow conversion. Total distributions to our shareholders were $876 million with $521 million in shares repurchased and $355 million in dividends paid.
Before I move into 2016 guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI and our lean track performance. Our 2015 lean tracks were able to achieve significant results. And let me briefly provide just a few examples and then talk about our tracks for 2016.
As a result of our Snapple buoyed closure track, we closed over 17,000 buoys on our Snapple brand across our was business units, adding to increase sales of the brand. In one of our back-office productivity tracks, we've reduced customer deductions by 13% across all of national and regional accounts, which has contributed to higher deductions collections.
And our South Texas region grew Canada Dry volumes by 15% this year as a result of our Canada Dry buoyed closure growth track. Again, those are just a few examples of the broad array of RCI activities we have going on in the business. 
As we move into 2016, we have a new set of lean tracks that are currently underway and focused on driving a balance on both top line growth and productivity. From a growth perspective, we'll have separate tracts dedicated to closing voice on smaller packages on brand Dr Pepper and improving distribution and availability on several of our allied brands. We'll also have a track's display dedicated to driving 7UP share growth.
We'll continue to drive productivity have across of the business with tracts focused on reducing DSD drive returned over rates and reducing additional nonworking cost within media so that we can reinvest those dollars back into supporting the business.
And of course, we'll continue to develop and embed lean capabilities throughout the organization. While the business improvements we've achieved had been important, I can add that more than 7,000 Kaizen certificates have been earned by our people participating in these improvement projects, and they had been proudly signed by Larry, myself and others. This may fact be our most important achievement.
Now moving on to 2016 full year guidance. We are expecting reported net sales to be up approximately 1%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 2% and earnings per share to be in the $4.20 to $4.30 range, inclusive of an $0.18 headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. I'll talk about our underlying foreign currency exchange rate assumptions in a moment.
Removing the year-over-year noncomparability cost by exchange rates, this guidance is in line or actually slightly better than our longer-term expectations of low single-digit net sales growth and mid single-digit operating profit growth, reflecting an expectation of continued strength in our underlying business.
Roughly 80% of our volumes are exposed to the CSD category, which continues to face headwinds particularly in diets, and we expect this trend to continue in 2016. That said, however, we have continued to outperform the CSD category, and we expect that trend to continue this year as well. We also have pricing opportunity across several of our Warehouse Direct brands that will temper our noncarb volumes in 2016, but are expected to improve our profitability.
And in Mexico, we have made a business decision to terminate a distribution agreement on our Aguafiel 10-liter business, which will also have a negative impact on our noncarb volumes, but will modestly help our bottom line. This volume reduction is expected to reduce total company volumes by just under 0.5. 
Given these assumptions, we expect total company sales volume to be about flat with CSDs up slightly and non-carbs down slightly, again, with non-carbs driven by pricing actions and determination of the Aguafiel TEN business. It is important highlight that weeks still expect continued growth from other noncore brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand Portfolio.
On the total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase. Price increases on several of our Warehouse Direct brands will drive another 30 basis points of pricing, and the remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
And as I just mentioned, we are expecting foreign currency to negatively impact our results in 2016. To give you some further insight and to help you with your modeling, the Mexican peso average 15.87 to the U.S. dollar in our 2015 results, and we are now planning on 18.67 for 2016, an increase of almost 18%. The Canadian dollar is also trending almost 15% higher than we experienced in 2015 with our current expectation that 1 47 Canadian to the U.S. dollar. Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we expect packaging and ingredients to be about flat on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation includes deflation on certain commodities such as aluminum and PET. However, also assumes offsetting inflation in corn driven by the price of co-products and higher tolling fees.
For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands, which are higher dollar revenue cases, we'll also increase of the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago.
Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016. Moving to SG&A. We're expecting an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015.
Furthermore, general inflation in our field labor cost will also increase total operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, and as we were able to achieve this year, RCI productivity benefits will help offset a portion of these increases.
We expect marketing spend to be about 7.5% of net sales in 2016. And while we expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will also experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. Now moving below segment operating profit.
Net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016 subject to market conditions. Now let me highlight a couple of facing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced than the first half of the year. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we will be terminating a distribution on our TEN Aguafiel business in Mexico, which will go into effect on April 1. Second, what we expect commodities to be about flat, I on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, we expect deflation in the first half of the year.
Fourth, we expect the reduction in marketing investments in the first quarter of the year based on timing of several of our media campaigns. And finally, we expect the uptick in interest expense to be heavily weighted towards of the first half of the year. With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

So first of all, of course, we expect better margin from smaller package mix. Allied brands, let's be careful and allied brands. As we reported everybody, at the gross margin line, they're a little some more because we buy the finished goods from third parties. But the operating line there are pretty good because we don't do all the selling, and we don't do all the market. So the operating profit flow-through is pretty good on allied brand. Segment mix will always be a function, particularly of concentrate versus finished goods with, of course, concentrate margins being much higher. I think those are the -- and then, of course, whatever happens with pricing, which in here, in CSDs, we don't plan for any. Not that it doesn't happen, but we sort of take that out of our expectations to make sure that we're otherwise focused on driving the operating plan with respect to those things that we can control and we don't, of course, due to Elliott control CSD pricing in the marketplace. So those artifacts you need to consider in modeling. Gross margin -- and of course, RCI performing productivity benefits have been strong. Whether from RCI was from other things going on the supply chain particular on packaging and packaging engineering. But we expect continued strong quarter productivity results in gross margins as well."

We grew bo",1023,"Thanks, Heather, and good morning to everyone. I'll start off this morning by saying I'm proud of our teams for the strong performance they delivered. 
We remained focused on our priorities and delivered tremendous top and bottom line results. We grew both dollar and volume share in CSDs and shelf-stable juice. We executed a strong year-long calendar of consumer-relevant programming and launched several new products to meet consumers' evolving needs, such as our Snapple Straight Up Tea and Hawaiian Punch in pouch packaging. We also added new flavors to our sparkling water lineup and brought Peñafiel into several Hispanic markets in the U.S.
From a distribution and availability standpoint, we held ACV for CSDs in grocery and grew distribution of sparkling waters in that channel. We also grew ACV for Snapple Premium by about a point in both grocery and convenience. And in grocery, we grew redistribution of Mott single-serve juice just over 3 points. Our fountain team added over 42,000 new valves across local and national accounts, expanding single-serve availability and creating new sampling occasions for our brands. 
And finally, our improving RCI capabilities across the organization are driving improvements in growth and productivity. This past year, we introduced an RCI management framework we call DPS in Action, starting with visual management across the company. And we'll build upon this framework in 2016.
Turning to the quarter. Bottler case sales increased 1% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD case sales were flat and non-carbs increased 4% in the quarter. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 2%. About half of this decline was driven by fountain foodservice in the quarter, as we lapped a fountain limited time offering in one of our larger accounts a year ago. We also continued to experience declines in diet for the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands also decreased 2% in the quarter, as a mid single-digit increase in Canada Dry was more than offset by a high single-digit increase in 7UP, a mid-single-digit decrease in Sunkist and a low single-digit decrease in A&W. For the full year, Dr Pepper declined just under 1% and our Core 4 brands were flat, reflecting better than category performance across our key CSD brands. Crush grew 4% in the quarter and Schweppes increased 7% on distribution gains in sparkling waters and growth in the ginger ale category. Squirt increased 3% and Peñafiel grew 10% on increased promotional activity and distribution gains. All other CSDs declined 1% in the quarter. 
In non-carbs, Snapple increased 4% on distribution gains and the launch of our Straight Up Tea line. Hawaiian Punch increased 3% and Mott grew 2% in the quarter. Clamato increased 5% on distribution gains and increased promotional activity. And our water category grew 21% on strong growth in Bai Brands, FIJI and our Aguafiel brand in Mexico. All other non-carb brands declined 5% in the quarter.
As we move into 2016, our strategy of building brands, executing with excellence and continuing to embed RCI and lean management across the organization remains the same. This year, we'll unlock growth in our portfolio through focused communications and relevant product and packaging innovation across our priority brands that consumers have told us we can win with. And we'll continue to use our improving marketing return on investment capabilities to provide better effectiveness on every dollar we spent. 
Execution is critical in this business. We will continue to work with our bottling partners to ensure priority brand execution on brand Dr Pepper. In our own DSD network, we'll continue to focus on execution excellence and driving distribution and availability across key brands and SKUs, with added focus on high-margin channels, like convenience and on-premise.
Our strategy of partnering with select allied brand partners is contributing to our growth, and these partnerships are a great supplement to our own in-house innovation. These brands allow us to leverage our large-scale distribution network and participate in growth emerging categories where we don't currently have a brand presence.
And finally, we'll continue to evolve RCI into our daily management process. We'll further integrate goal deployment of visual management across the business. And we will continue to develop lean capabilities and bench strength through our developing leader program, all to ensure we continue to build the best operating team in the industry. 
As I just said, building our brands is a key component of our strategy, and we've got some great plans in 2016 to drive excitement with our consumers, retail and bottling partners. Dr Pepper returns to the big screen in March, partnering with this year's blockbuster superhero movie, Batman versus Superman, driving activation at all our top retailers. We'll also bring back superstar, Lil' Sweet, in a new media campaign, continuing to highlight the great taste and sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. This summer, Dr Pepper's pick your Pepper will give millennials a unique way to express their individuality with 150 one-of-a-kind labels to choose from. And in the fall, the brand will once again dominate college football.
We'll feature several periods of holiday-themed activity throughout the year across our Core 4 brands. And we'll take advantage of the growing ginger ale and cherry segments with incremental media and retail activity behind Canada Dry, Cherry Dr Pepper and Cherry 7UP. We're also rolling out 7.5 ounce slim cans across our Core 4 portfolio and our company-owned DSD network to participate in the growth of this consumer-preferred package. 
Snapple will continue to deliver new news to the category with 2 new seasonal LTOs planned for later in the year. And Straight Up Tea is getting a facelift with new graphics and 2 new varieties of green and herbal teas.
Mott's is partnering with Universal Pictures with Secret Life of Pets and will feature packaging with characters from the movie. 
And Clamato will share recipes for mixing occasions on social media throughout the year, as we take advantage of this brand's strong mixer heritage.
I'm sure you'll agree we've got a full calendar of activity plan for the year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Sales volume was flat, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin stood at 21.3%, up 200 basis points. Core EPS was up 14% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 15% and core EPS was up 16%.
For the year, sales volumes were up 1% with reported net sales up 3%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 5%. Core operating income was up 9%, yielding an operating margin of 20.9%, up 120 basis points from last year. Core EPS for the year was up 10%. 
Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 11% and core EPS was up 12% for the year. And without foreign currency transaction, these year-over-year growth rates would be even higher. All in all, some very good results for the quarter and the year. 
Now let me provide some further details on the quarter.
Contributing to our currency-neutral net sales increase of 4% were favorable product, package and segment mix, along with increased price realization. Net sales also benefited from lower discounts, primarily in our fountain foodservice business, as we lapped a higher trade accrual recorded last year. 
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which, 20 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs increased gross margins by 150 basis points in the quarter. And continued strong productivity benefits, including those from Rapid Continuous Improvement, increased gross margins by another 60 basis points. The impact of net pricing in the quarter increased gross margins by 50 basis points. And decreases in other manufacturing cost increased gross margins by 10 basis points. Product, package and segment mix reduced gross margins by 110 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margin in the quarter by 60 basis points, as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $24 million on a favorable unrealized commodity mark-to-market effect of $21 million and a favorable comparison to a $14 million pension charge recorded last year. Foreign currency translation also reduced reported SG&A expense by $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in certain operating expenses, increased management incentive compensation and an increase in marketing investments.
Depreciation and amortization declined $3 million in the quarter, reflecting recent trends in our capital spending efficiencies. We also recorded a $7 million impairment charge on our Garden Cocktail brand, which is included in other operating expense. Garden Cocktail is a vegetable juice sold in Canada. It's a fairly small volume brand that we continue to sell, but given recent declining category trends, an impairment was indicated.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million in the quarter, as we borrowed in November to refinance a $500 million debt maturity in January. And our reported effective tax rate was 36.4% compared to 34.8% last year.
Now moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $991 million, down $31 million compared to last year. Capital spending was in line with our guidance at $179 million compared to $170 million last year, resulting in another strong year of free cash flow conversion. Total distributions to our shareholders were $876 million, with $521 million in shares repurchased and $355 million in dividends paid.
Before I move into 2016 guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI and our lean track performance. Our 2015 lean tracks were able to achieve significant results. And let me briefly provide just a few examples and then talk about our tracks for 2016.
As a result of our Snapple void closure track, we closed over 17,000 voids on our Snapple brand across our west business unit, adding to increased sales of the brand. In one of our back-office productivity tracks, we've reduced customer deductions by 13% across all of national and regional accounts, which has contributed to higher deductions collections. And our South Texas region grew Canada Dry volumes by 15% this year as a result of our Canada Dry void closure growth track. Again, those are just a few examples of the broad array of RCI activities we have going on in the business. 
As we move into 2016, we have a new set of lean tracks that are currently underway and focused on driving a balance of both top line growth and productivity. From a growth perspective, we'll have separate tracks dedicated to closing voids on smaller packages on brand Dr Pepper and improving distribution and availability on several of our allied brands. We also have a track specifically dedicated to driving 7UP share growth.
We'll continue to drive productivity across of the business, with tracks focused on reducing DSD driver turnover rates and reducing additional nonworking cost within media so that we can reinvest those dollars back into supporting the business.
And of course, we'll continue to develop and embed lean capabilities throughout the organization. 
While the business improvements we've achieved had been important, I can add that more than 7,000 Kaizen certificates have been earned by our people participating in these improvement projects, and they have been proudly signed by Larry, myself and others. This may, in fact, be our most important achievement.
Now moving on to 2016 full year guidance. We are expecting reported net sales to be up approximately 1%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 2%, and earnings per share to be in the $4.20 to $4.30 range, inclusive of an $0.18 headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. I'll talk about our underlying foreign currency exchange rate assumptions in a moment.
Removing the year-over-year noncomparability caused by exchange rates, this guidance is in line or actually slightly better than our longer-term expectations of low single-digit net sales growth and mid-single-digit operating profit growth, reflecting an expectation of continued strength in our underlying business.
Roughly 80% of our volumes are exposed to the CSD category, which continues to face headwinds particularly in diets, and we expect this trend to continue in 2016. That said, however, we have continued to outperform the CSD category, and we expect that trend to continue this year as well. We also have pricing opportunity across several of our Warehouse Direct brands that will temper our non-carb volumes in 2016, but are expected to improve our profitability.
And in Mexico, we have made a business decision to terminate a distribution agreement on our Aguafiel 10-liter business, which will also have a negative impact on our non-carb volumes, but will modestly help our bottom line. This volume reduction is expected to reduce total company volumes by just under 0.5 point. 
Given these assumptions, we expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs up slightly and non-carbs down slightly, again, with non-carbs driven by pricing actions and the termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. It is important to highlight that we still expect continued growth from other non-carb brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase. Price increases on several of our Warehouse Direct brands will drive another 30 basis points of pricing, and the remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
And as I just mentioned, we are expecting foreign currency to negatively impact our results in 2016. To give you some further insight and to help you with your modeling, the Mexican peso averaged MXN 15.87 to the U.S. dollar in our 2015 results, and we're now planning on MXN 18.67 for 2016, an increase of almost 18%. The Canadian dollar is also trending almost 15% higher than we experienced in 2015, with our current expectation a CAD 1.47 to the U.S. dollar. 
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we expect packaging and ingredients to be about flat on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation includes deflation on certain commodities, such as aluminum and PET, however, also assumes offsetting inflation in corn, driven by the price of co-products and higher tolling fees.
For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our non-carb portfolio and allied brands, which are higher dollar revenue cases, will also increase of the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago.
Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016. 
Moving to SG&A. We're expecting an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. Furthermore, general inflation in our field labor costs will also increase total operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, and as we were able to achieve this year, RCI productivity benefits will help offset a portion of these increases.
We expect marketing spend to be about 7.5% of net sales in 2016. And while we expect favorability from lower fuel cost in 2016, we will also experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. 
Now moving below segment operating profit. Net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016 subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models. First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
Second, as I mentioned earlier, we will be terminating a distribution on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which will go into effect on April 1. 
Third, while we expect commodities to be about flat on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, we do expect deflation in the first half of the year. 
Fourth, we expect the reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter of the year, based on timing of several of our media campaigns. 
And finally, we expect the uptick in interest expense to be heavily weighted towards of the first half of the year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

So first of all, of course, we expect better margins from smaller package mix. Allied brands, let's be careful on allied brands. As we've reminded everybody, at the gross margin line, they're a little smaller because we buy the finished goods from third parties. But the operating line, they're pretty good because we don't do all the selling and we don't do all the marketing. So the operating profit flow-through is pretty good on allied brand. Segment mix will always be a function, particularly of concentrate versus finished goods, with of course, concentrate margins being much higher. I think those are the -- and then, of course, whatever happens with pricing, which in here, in CSDs, we don't plan for any. Not that it doesn't happen, but we sort of take that out of our expectation to make sure that we otherwise focus on driving the operating plan with respect to those things that we can control, and we don't, of course, unilaterally control CSD pricing in the marketplace. So those artifacts you need to consider in modeling gross margin. And of course, RCI. I mean, productivity benefits have been strong. Whether from RCI, whether from other things going on in supply chain, particularly around packaging and packaging engineering. But we expect continued strong productivity results in gross margins as well."

So can you give us some insight into your thinking there in terms of what you recommend to the board?

We grew bo",1023,"Thanks, Heather, and good morning to everyone. I'll start off this morning by saying I'm proud of our teams for the strong performance they delivered. 
We remained focused on our priorities and delivered tremendous top and bottom line results. We grew both dollar and volume share in CSDs and shelf-stable juice. We executed a strong year-long calendar of consumer-relevant programming and launched several new products to meet consumers' evolving needs, such as our Snapple Straight Up Tea and Hawaiian Punch in pouch packaging. We also added new flavors to our sparkling water lineup and brought Peñafiel into several Hispanic markets in the U.S.
From a distribution and availability standpoint, we held ACV for CSDs in grocery and grew distribution of sparkling waters in that channel. We also grew ACV for Snapple Premium by about a point in both grocery and convenience. And in grocery, we grew redistribution of Mott single-serve juice just over 3 points. Our fountain team added over 42,000 new valves across local and national accounts, expanding single-serve availability and creating new sampling occasions for our brands. 
And finally, our improving RCI capabilities across the organization are driving improvements in growth and productivity. This past year, we introduced an RCI management framework we call DPS in Action, starting with visual management across the company. And we'll build upon this framework in 2016.
Turning to the quarter. Bottler case sales increased 1% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD case sales were flat and non-carbs increased 4% in the quarter. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 2%. About half of this decline was driven by fountain foodservice in the quarter, as we lapped a fountain limited time offering in one of our larger accounts a year ago. We also continued to experience declines in diet for the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands also decreased 2% in the quarter, as a mid single-digit increase in Canada Dry was more than offset by a high single-digit decrease in 7UP, a mid-single-digit decrease in Sunkist and a low single-digit decrease in A&W. For the full year, Dr Pepper declined just under 1% and our Core 4 brands were flat, reflecting better than category performance across our key CSD brands. Crush grew 4% in the quarter and Schweppes increased 7% on distribution gains in sparkling waters and growth in the ginger ale category. Squirt increased 3% and Peñafiel grew 10% on increased promotional activity and distribution gains. All other CSDs declined 1% in the quarter. 
In non-carbs, Snapple increased 4% on distribution gains and the launch of our Straight Up Tea line. Hawaiian Punch increased 3% and Mott’s grew 2% in the quarter. Clamato increased 5% on distribution gains and increased promotional activity. And our water category grew 21% on strong growth in Bai Brands, FIJI and our Aguafiel brand in Mexico. All other non-carb brands declined 5% in the quarter.
As we move into 2016, our strategy of building brands, executing with excellence and continuing to embed RCI and lean management across the organization remains the same. This year, we'll unlock growth in our portfolio through focused communications and relevant product and packaging innovation across our priority brands that consumers have told us we can win with. And we'll continue to use our improving marketing return on investment capabilities to provide better effectiveness on every dollar we spent. 
Execution is critical in this business. We will continue to work with our bottling partners to ensure priority brand execution on brand Dr Pepper. In our own DSD network, we'll continue to focus on execution excellence and driving distribution and availability across key brands and SKUs, with added focus on high-margin channels, like convenience and on-premise.
Our strategy of partnering with select allied brand partners is contributing to our growth, and these partnerships are a great supplement to our own in-house innovation. These brands allow us to leverage our large-scale distribution network and participate in growth emerging categories where we don't currently have a brand presence.
And finally, we'll continue to evolve RCI into our daily management process. We'll further integrate goal deployment of visual management across the business. And we will continue to develop lean capabilities and bench strength through our developing leader program, all to ensure we continue to build the best operating team in the industry. 
As I just said, building our brands is a key component of our strategy, and we've got some great plans in 2016 to drive excitement with our consumers, retail and bottling partners. Dr Pepper returns to the big screen in March, partnering with this year's blockbuster superhero movie, Batman versus Superman, driving activation at all our top retailers. We'll also bring back superstar Lil' Sweet in a new media campaign, continuing to highlight the great taste and sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. This summer, Dr Pepper's pick your Pepper will give millennials a unique way to express their individuality with 150 one-of-a-kind labels to choose from. And in the fall, the brand will once again dominate college football.
We'll feature several periods of holiday-themed activity throughout the year across our Core 4 brands. And we'll take advantage of the growing ginger ale and cherry segments with incremental media and retail activity behind Canada Dry, Cherry Dr Pepper and Cherry 7UP. We're also rolling out 7.5 ounce slim cans across our Core 4 portfolio and our company-owned DSD network to participate in the growth of this consumer-preferred package. 
Snapple will continue to deliver new news to the category with 2 new seasonal LTOs planned for later in the year. And Straight Up Tea is getting a facelift with new graphics and 2 new varieties of green and herbal teas.
Mott's is partnering with Universal Pictures with Secret Life of Pets and will feature packaging with characters from the movie. 
And Clamato will share recipes for mixing occasions on social media throughout the year as we take advantage of this brand's strong mixer heritage.
I'm sure you'll agree we've got a full calendar of activity plan for the year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,323553636,934853,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Larry.

Sales volume was flat, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin stood at 21.3%, up 200 basis points. Core EPS was up 14% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 15% and core EPS was up 16%.
For the year, sales volumes were up 1% with reported net sales up 3%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 5%. Core operating income was up 9%, yielding an operating margin of 20.9%, up 120 basis points from last year. Core EPS for the year was up 10%. 
Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 11% and core EPS was up 12% for the year. And without foreign currency transaction, these year-over-year growth rates would be even higher. All in all, some very good results for the quarter and the year. 
Now let me provide some further details on the quarter.
Contributing to our currency-neutral net sales increase of 4% were favorable product, package and segment mix, along with increased price realization. Net sales also benefited from lower discounts, primarily in our fountain foodservice business, as we lapped a higher trade accrual recorded last year. 
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 20 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs increased gross margins by 150 basis points in the quarter. And continued strong productivity benefits, including those from Rapid Continuous Improvement, increased gross margins by another 60 basis points. The impact of net pricing in the quarter increased gross margins by 50 basis points. And decreases in other manufacturing cost increased gross margins by 10 basis points. Product, package and segment mix reduced gross margins by 110 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margin in the quarter by 60 basis points, as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $24 million on a favorable unrealized commodity mark-to-market effect of $21 million and a favorable comparison to a $14 million pension charge recorded last year. Foreign currency translation also reduced reported SG&A expense by $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in certain operating expenses, increased management incentive compensation and an increase in marketing investments.
Depreciation and amortization declined $3 million in the quarter, reflecting recent trends in our capital spending efficiencies. We also recorded a $7 million impairment charge on our Garden Cocktail brand, which is included in other operating expense. Garden Cocktail is a vegetable juice sold in Canada. It's a fairly small volume brand that we continue to sell, but given recent declining category trends, an impairment was indicated.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million in the quarter, as we borrowed in November to refinance a $500 million debt maturity in January. And our reported effective tax rate was 36.4% compared to 34.8% last year.
Now moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $991 million, down $31 million compared to last year. Capital spending was in line with our guidance at $179 million compared to $170 million last year, resulting in another strong year of free cash flow conversion. Total distributions to our shareholders were $876 million, with $521 million in shares repurchased and $355 million in dividends paid.
Before I move into 2016 guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI and our lean track performance. Our 2015 lean tracks were able to achieve significant results. And let me briefly provide just a few examples and then talk about our tracks for 2016.
As a result of our Snapple void closure track, we closed over 17,000 voids on our Snapple brand across our west business unit, adding to increased sales of the brand. In one of our back-office productivity tracks, we've reduced customer deductions by 13% across all of national and regional accounts, which has contributed to higher deductions collections. And our South Texas region grew Canada Dry volumes by 15% this year as a result of our Canada Dry void closure growth track. Again, those are just a few examples of the broad array of RCI activities we have going on in the business. 
As we move into 2016, we have a new set of lean tracks that are currently under way and focused on driving a balance of both top line growth and productivity. From a growth perspective, we'll have separate tracks dedicated to closing voids on smaller packages on brand Dr Pepper and improving distribution and availability on several of our allied brands. We also have a track specifically dedicated to driving 7UP share growth.
We'll continue to drive productivity across of the business, with tracks focused on reducing DSD driver turnover rates and reducing additional nonworking cost within media so that we can reinvest those dollars back into supporting the business.
And of course, we'll continue to develop and embed lean capabilities throughout the organization. 
While the business improvements we've achieved have been important, I can add that more than 7,000 Kaizen certificates have been earned by our people participating in these improvement projects, and they have been proudly signed by Larry, myself and others. This may, in fact, be our most important achievement.
Now moving on to 2016 full year guidance. We are expecting reported net sales to be up approximately 1%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 2%, and earnings per share to be in the $4.20 to $4.30 range, inclusive of an $0.18 headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. I'll talk about our underlying foreign currency exchange rate assumptions in a moment.
Removing the year-over-year noncomparability caused by exchange rates, this guidance is in line or actually slightly better than our longer-term expectations of low single-digit net sales growth and mid-single-digit operating profit growth, reflecting an expectation of continued strength in our underlying business.
Roughly 80% of our volumes are exposed to the CSD category, which continues to face headwinds particularly in diets, and we expect this trend to continue in 2016. That said, however, we have continued to outperform the CSD category, and we expect that trend to continue this year as well. We also have pricing opportunity across several of our Warehouse Direct brands that will temper our non-carb volumes in 2016, but are expected to improve our profitability.
And in Mexico, we have made a business decision to terminate a distribution agreement on our Aguafiel 10-liter business, which will also have a negative impact on our non-carb volumes, but will modestly help our bottom line. This volume reduction is expected to reduce total company volumes by just under 0.5 point. 
Given these assumptions, we expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs up slightly and non-carbs down slightly, again, with non-carbs driven by pricing actions and the termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. It is important to highlight that we still expect continued growth from other non-carb brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase. Price increases on several of our Warehouse Direct brands will drive another 30 basis points of pricing, and the remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
And as I just mentioned, we are expecting foreign currency to negatively impact our results in 2016. To give you some further insight and to help you with your modeling, the Mexican peso averaged MXN 15.87 to the U.S. dollar in our 2015 results, and we're now planning on MXN 18.67 for 2016, an increase of almost 18%. The Canadian dollar is also trending almost 15% higher than we experienced in 2015, with our current expectation at CAD 1.47 to the U.S. dollar. 
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we expect packaging and ingredients to be about flat on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation includes deflation on certain commodities, such as aluminum and PET, however, also assumes offsetting inflation in corn, driven by the price of co-products and higher tolling fees.
For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our non-carb portfolio and allied brands, which are higher dollar revenue cases, will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago.
Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016. 
Moving to SG&A. We're expecting an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. Furthermore, general inflation in our field labor costs will also increase total operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, and as we were able to achieve this year, RCI productivity benefits will help offset a portion of these increases.
We expect marketing spend to be about 7.5% of net sales in 2016. And while we expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will also experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. 
Now moving below segment operating profit. Net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016 subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models. First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
Second, as I mentioned earlier, we will be terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which will go into effect on April 1. 
Third, while we expect commodities to be about flat on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, we do expect deflation in the first half of the year. 
Fourth, we expect the reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter of the year, based on timing of several of our media campaigns. 
And finally, we expect the uptick in interest expense to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

So first of all, of course, we expect better margins from smaller package mix. Allied brands, let's be careful on allied brands. As we've reminded everybody, at the gross margin line, they're a little smaller because we buy the finished goods from third parties. But the operating line, they're pretty good because we don't do all the selling and we don't do all the marketing. So the operating profit flow-through is pretty good on allied brand. Segment mix will always be a function, particularly of concentrate versus finished goods, with of course, concentrate margins being much higher. I think those are the -- and then, of course, whatever happens with pricing, which in here, in CSDs, we don't plan for any. Not that it doesn't happen, but we sort of take that out of our expectation to make sure that we otherwise focus on driving the operating plan with respect to those things that we can control, and we don't, of course, unilaterally control CSD pricing in the marketplace. I mean, those are the factors you need to consider in modeling gross margin. And of course, RCI. I mean, productivity benefits have been strong. Whether from RCI, whether from other things going on in supply chain, particularly around packaging and packaging engineering.

You're right to hit on the risk that probably not if, but when these entrepreneurs decide to exit, could there be some risk that somebody else steps in and acquires them and removes the distribution from us? The answer, of course, is yes. So it's a choice we've made to participate in growing in emerging categories, recognizing that down the road, that risk is there and some may end up going away at some point, but others are coming in all the time.

But as we factored in the diets and we had the fountain, large promotional activity and new availability on fountain a year ago, we're still very pleased with where Dr Pepper is at and where our plans are for taking it in 2016. You've heard some of the programs we had out there with it. Our bottlers are committed, excited about the brand. It continues to be a big contributor for them. So we're very pleased."

And maybe the answer is embedded in your response to Bill's earlier question. But you talked in the past about striking a balance between the dividend increase and share buybacks and I appreciate you’re doing both in 2016. But the 10% dividend increase really doesn't move the needle too much on your payout ratio, which is still below peers. And it seems just out of balance with the essentially 30% increase in buybacks at the midpoint in terms of striking that balance when the multiple in your stock is essentially at an all-time-high level. So can you give us some insight into your thinking there in terms of what you recommend to the board? And maybe the answer is that $250 million debt finance step-up is kind of onetime and it rolls back off. But just how do we think about you striking a balance between what right now seems like an imbalanced strategy for 2016?"

I know I've communicated to many of you that if we were going to lean one way or the other, probably, we would go more heavily into the dividend. And maybe one day we will, but as we go out and talk to shareholders, Steve, they -- most of them are satisfied with this. So we didn't see the need to do anything much different.

And you're seeing lots of other products in this space coming up. But it's still small. So that's a lot of opportunity. Let me go to Dr Pepper, if that's okay. I think you then want to know percent changes on Dr Pepper on a bottler -- as we measure, bottler case sales. So throughput cases. The brand is -- regular Dr Pepper, actually, I'll round it to down 1%, but it was actually even less than that fourth quarter. And on a bottler case, diet was down 4.5%. And if you look at Nielsen data, you'll see other diets down 6%, 7%, 8%."

We had a solid start to the year, and as always, I'm proud of our teams for delivering against our strategy and key priorities. Our brands are strong, and we're consistently focused on driving improved execution in the marketplace. RCI continues to embed deeper into the organization and deliver growth and productivity across the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 4 points of positive mix and price. We were able to achieve growth across our portfolio in both CSDs and noncarbs, with both increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper increased 4%, reflecting growth in our Fountain foodservice business. Over half of this growth was due to timing of sales to a large bottling customer that we had planned for in the second quarter. 
Our Core 4 brands increased 3% -- decreased 3% as growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines of 7UP, Sunkist Soda and A&W. Crush and Schweppes grew 6% and 10%, respectively on increased promotional activity at a larger retailer. Squirt grew by 3% and Peñafiel increased 5% in the quarter, while lapping 20% growth a year ago. All other CSDs decreased 1% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple increased 4% in the quarter, Hawaiian Punch decreased 7% as planned, driven by price increases on singleserve packages. And Mott's decreased 4%, again as planned, on lower promotional activity and continued declines in the juice category. Clamato grew 10% in the quarter, primarily on increased promotional activity. And our water category grew by 22%. Aguafiel grew double digits. And continued strong contribution to growth were also driven by a number of our allied brands, including Bai and FIJI. All other noncarb brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
Our allied brand strategy is enabling us to quickly capture growth in emerging categories. I am pleased to announce 2 new recent partnerships, Core Hydration, a purified water rich with and minerals; and , a cold brewed ready-to-drink coffee. We believe both products have strong market potential.
Building our brands is a key component of our strategy. And our calendar for the summer is packed with programs that will engage and connect with our consumers as well as drive excitement with every retail and bottling partners. First, I hope you all swa recently that Beverage Digest reported that Regular Dr Pepper is now the fourth largest CSD brand in the category, surpassing a large competitive flavor brand. It's a good reminder that we compete in flavored CSDs, not colas. And Nielsen data shows that flavors over the past 2 [ph] are up in retail dollars by almost 4%.  
That is an exciting win for the Dr Pepper brand, and our summer line up of activity will keep the momentum going. Our Pick Your Pepper program will offer millennial consumers 150 one-of-a-kind labels on 20-ounce singleserve bottles that will allow them to express their individuality. 
We know that our Li'l Sweet campaign was a huge success for Diet Dr Pepper last year. So we brought them back for an encore performance highlighting the great sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. 
We're also driving a big push behind Cherry Dr Pepper, with a new media campaign inclusive of both traditional and digital media and activation elements at retail. We know that this product is an entry point into the brand, specifically with Hispanic consumers, so we are leveraging to bring new consumers into the franchise. 
We're rolling out 7.5-ounce slim cans across our key CSD brands and our DSD network. As we know, this is a consumer-preferred package. We'll get Schweppes sparkling waters into more consumers' hands with incremental trial activity. And we'll top off the summer with incremental media and activity behind Cherry 7UP.
Mott's will feature characters from Universal's The Secret LIfe of Pets movie on several key products throughout the summer and will drive incremental points of interruption with a new patriotic Snapple LTL. We've also added 2 new flavors to our straight up tea lineup, Honey Green and Herbal . to spice of summer gatherings, Clamato with partner with an authentic Mexican beer as the original mixer. I'm sure you'll agree we've got a great lineup for the summer.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up",1628,"Thank you, Larry. 
Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up 190 basis points. Core EPS was up 16% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 14% and core EPS was up 17%. All in all, some good results for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some further detail.  Reported net sales increased 2% in the first quarter on 3 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over a 1.5 points of unfavorable foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix as a result of our higher proportion of this year of concentrate sales to finished goods case sales. Net sales was further reduced by just over 0.5 point for higher discounts driven by accrual timing in our Fountain foodservice business that will reverse in the third quarter of the year. 
Reported gross margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.5% last year to 59.5% this year, of which 30 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. And continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI, increased gross margins by another 40 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing in the quarter also increased gross margins by 40 basis points. The effect of mix, mostly product, reduced gross margins by 70 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars, as finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $6 million on a planned marketing reduction of $12 million, driven by timing of media and programming, favorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in transportation costs driven by lower fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary and certain other increases in operating expenses. Furthermore, included in our core SG&A is a $4 million arbitration award associated with our Mexican joint venture. Specific to our segment, this charge reduced their reported operating income growth by 24 percentage points.  Depreciation and amortization declined $1 million in the quarter. 
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher rates from our January debt refinance and an overall higher debt balance. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last year.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $177 million, up $76 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of working capital and the increase in net income. Capital spending was $27 million compared to $20 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $269 million, with $179 million in shares repurchased and $90 million in dividends paid.
Moving on to RCI, I'll give a brief update on the progress of a few of our lean tracks, but first, I would like to mention that last month, we were honored at the Lean and Six Sigma Conference with its first ever Deployment of the Year award, specifically recognizing the depth, breadth and scope of our RCI rollout across the company. This is tremendous recognition for us, though we always remind ourselves that RCI is a journey that never ends and we continue to have a long runway of opportunity.
From a growth standpoint, the Dr Pepper smaller packages growth lean track has closed over 1,100 distribution voids in a large retailer. And in the Plains region, our allied brand distribution and availability track netted almost a 9% increase in distribution of priority SKUs. And these are great examples of engaging our partners in the value chain and together using proven process improvement methods to drive even better levels of retail execution.
Our 7UP lean track is under way, and the team has done extensive analytic rigor on the brand and they have gone to in some of our larger markets. We've got multiple kaizens in key markets scheduled over the next couple of months where we will identify and attack the root causes of the brand's recent performance in those markets. And we're seeing early wins in our productivity track for reducing both DSD driver turnover and nonworking media spend. Again, just a very few examples of the improvement initiatives taking place across our business every single day.
Now moving to 2016 guidance. We expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%, which is down from our prior guidance of a 2% headwind. 
We also now expect EPS to be in the high end of our previously communicated range of $4.20 to $4.30. This is inclusive of about a 2.5-point headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 4% that we had originally expected. 
We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Given the category headwinds in CSDs, we expect CSDs to be about flat, while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business in Mexico. We still expect continued growth from our noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio. 
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be over 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase, and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods, given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 0.5% deflationary on a constant volume-mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum, but also now reflects less of a headwind on corn than we originally expected, driven primarily by more favorable pricing of corn coproducts from which we derive our net price for corn. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods, and also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all of the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. And while we still expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. That said, we still believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. 
Based on some recent favorable marketing return on investment results and incremental opportunities across our ales, sparkling waters and juice brands, we're spending about $5 million more in marketing than we initially expected. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we recorded an unplanned arbitration award of $4 million related to our Mexican joint venture and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. As I also mentioned earlier, this charge is included in core results.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing.  Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales.  We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Second, as Larry mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, over half of our growth in brand Dr Pepper in the first quarter was driven by timing of sales that were planned for in the second quarter. Third, we'll be potentially terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which we have planned for in the second quarter. Fourth, while we expect commodities to be about 0.5 point deflationary on a constant volume-mix basis for the full year, the deflation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Fifth, based on timing of prior year true-ups, the $20 million increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs will be heavily weighted in both the second and third quarters. And finally, while we expected a reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter, driven by media and programming shifts, we are expecting increased investment in both the second and third quarters. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

Let me just get rid of the -- the concentrate question, as we said in our annual January 1 concentrate increase on concentrate and syrup prices go up as well, we said is about 40 basis points in pricing spread over all of our $6 billion-plus in sales. So there's nothing new there. I mean, the timing issue in the first quarter with shipment had no impact on pricing per se. It's simply the quantity of syrup. And the accrual is the timing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we accrued a little more in the first quarter. It's going to come back in the third quarter. Let me shift over to marketing and again, it was really about specific opportunities in ale, sparkling waters and juices. There's going to be some specific emphasis on Mott's. So let me just pullback and sort of deal with this timing issue in the first quarter as well. we'll get that off the table. One of the things we talked last year ago and continue to talk about some of the updated strategy work we've been doing for our key brands. And I would tell you through that process, which took us all of last year, we came up with some different conclusions about communications and messaging for many -- for some of our brands that I would tell you were different from some of our prior points of view. So we took the input from initially what was 35,000 consumer surveys that I think got culled down to roughly 25,000 good surveys about how they felt about our brands on a number of dimensions. And as a result, we're changing our communication messaging. And quite frankly because we've decided to make some changes, it's taking a little more time than we originally -- not more time than we thought because we planned for this. But the lighter spend in the first quarter was really a function of that new time line for us to create a new creative. And so we planned for that. We're going to still spend 7.5% of sales this year, like we always have. as I said in the incremental $5 million, these opportunities came up. Schweppes, that category is growing double digits, some insights on Mott's. And so I would call that sort of evolution, not -- nothing -- evolution of our return on investment insights and process to tell us where best to spend some money. In this case, we didn't just shift, we added $5 million."

If we look at this this year, you've obviously got a big bump up there. If we see even remotely close similar sequential improvement in the margin over the balance of the year as we've seen in past years, that would imply just tremendous margin upside here.

So let me help you guide you guys here. So when you look at the absolute level of first quarter margins for Packaged Beverages, I think the one call that I would give you that's worth about, and you're talking of course about operating margins, probably the -- they're a piece of the $12 million marketing benefit. Because we know that's timing, probably helped our operating margins by about 50 basis points, okay? So there -- so given their current mix, given current levels of input costs, even given current levels of foreign exchange because we have our WD Canada business as part of the segment. So taking current levels in the first quarter, we sort of get the margins you get, less I would say 50 basis points for the marketing shift. What we like about Packaged Beverages, and the reason that margins have ticked up the way they have, is that they're getting this extraordinary benefit from first and foremost, mix. And as I said earlier, they're benefiting from the allied brands. This is good business for us and it's good business for our brand owners. And in our WD portfolio, the products that are growing are some of our best margin products. As you know -- and oh, by the way, I would say we will take growth in all of those brands and traded them all day long for whether it's decline in Hawaiian Punch or for that matter, decline in 7UP. So enormous beneficial mix, and that of course, I sai d they've got a point in pricing. that pricing environment seems to be pretty good. Year-over-year, commodities and fuel are pretty important to them, okay, and drove probably $18 million or so of year-over-year improvement. But nevertheless, those are the prices of commodities today. That is the price of fuel today. oil is going up a little bit. And saw there 4 the current margin structure I'd say it looks to be where it is in Q1, absent what I'd call out as timing."

We had a solid start to the year, and as always, I'm proud of our teams for delivering against our strategy and key priorities. Our brands are strong, and we're consistently focused on driving improved execution in the marketplace. RCI continues to embed deeper into the organization and deliver growth and productivity across the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 4 points of positive mix and price. We were able to achieve growth across our portfolio in both CSDs and noncarbs, with both increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper increased 4%, reflecting growth in our Fountain foodservice business. Over half of this growth was due to timing of sales to a large bottling customer that we had planned for in the second quarter. 
Our Core 4 brands increased 3% -- decreased 3% as growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines of 7UP, Sunkist Soda and A&W. Crush and Schweppes grew 6% and 10%, respectively on increased promotional activity at a larger retailer. Squirt grew by 3% and Peñafiel increased 5% in the quarter, while lapping 20% growth a year ago. All other CSDs decreased 1% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple increased 4% in the quarter, Hawaiian Punch decreased 7% as planned, driven by price increases on singleserve packages. And Mott's decreased 4%, again as planned, on lower promotional activity and continued declines in the juice category. Clamato grew 10% in the quarter, primarily on increased promotional activity. And our water category grew by 22%. Aguafiel grew double digits. And continued strong contribution to growth were also driven by a number of our allied brands, including Bai and FIJI. All other noncarb brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
Our allied brand strategy is enabling us to quickly capture growth in emerging categories. I am pleased to announce 2 new recent partnerships, Core Hydration, a purified water rich with and minerals; and , a cold brewed ready-to-drink coffee. We believe both products have strong market potential.
Building our brands is a key component of our strategy. And our calendar for the summer is packed with programs that will engage and connect with our consumers as well as drive excitement with every retail and bottling partners. First, I hope you all swa recently that Beverage Digest reported that Regular Dr Pepper is now the fourth largest CSD brand in the category, surpassing a large competitive flavor brand. It's a good reminder that we compete in flavored CSDs, not colas. And Nielsen data shows that flavors over the past 2 [ph] are up in retail dollars by almost 4%.  
That is an exciting win for the Dr Pepper brand, and our summer line up of activity will keep the momentum going. Our Pick Your Pepper program will offer millennial consumers 150 one-of-a-kind labels on 20-ounce singleserve bottles that will allow them to express their individuality. 
We know that our Li'l Sweet campaign was a huge success for Diet Dr Pepper last year. So we brought them back for an encore performance highlighting the great sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. 
We're also driving a big push behind Cherry Dr Pepper, with a new media campaign inclusive of both traditional and digital media and activation elements at retail. We know that this product is an entry point into the brand, specifically with Hispanic consumers, so we are leveraging to bring new consumers into the franchise. 
We're rolling out 7.5-ounce slim cans across our key CSD brands and our DSD network. As we know, this is a consumer-preferred package. We'll get Schweppes sparkling waters into more consumers' hands with incremental trial activity. And we'll top off the summer with incremental media and activity behind Cherry 7UP.
Mott's will feature characters from Universal's The Secret LIfe of Pets movie on several key products throughout the summer and will drive incremental points of interruption with a new patriotic Snapple LTL. We've also added 2 new flavors to our straight up tea lineup, Honey Green and Herbal . to spice of summer gatherings, Clamato with partner with an authentic Mexican beer as the original mixer. I'm sure you'll agree we've got a great lineup for the summer.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up",1628,"Thank you, Larry. 
Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up 190 basis points. Core EPS was up 16% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 14% and core EPS was up 17%. All in all, some good results for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some further detail.  Reported net sales increased 2% in the first quarter on 3 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over a 1.5 points of unfavorable foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix as a result of our higher proportion of this year of concentrate sales to finished goods case sales. Net sales was further reduced by just over 0.5 point for higher discounts driven by accrual timing in our Fountain foodservice business that will reverse in the third quarter of the year. 
Reported gross margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.5% last year to 59.5% this year, of which 30 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. And continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI, increased gross margins by another 40 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing in the quarter also increased gross margins by 40 basis points. The effect of mix, mostly product, reduced gross margins by 70 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars, as finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $6 million on a planned marketing reduction of $12 million, driven by timing of media and programming, favorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in transportation costs driven by lower fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary and certain other increases in operating expenses. Furthermore, included in our core SG&A is a $4 million arbitration award associated with our Mexican joint venture. Specific to our segment, this charge reduced their reported operating income growth by 24 percentage points.  Depreciation and amortization declined $1 million in the quarter. 
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher rates from our January debt refinance and an overall higher debt balance. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last year.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $177 million, up $76 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of working capital and the increase in net income. Capital spending was $27 million compared to $20 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $269 million, with $179 million in shares repurchased and $90 million in dividends paid.
Moving on to RCI, I'll give a brief update on the progress of a few of our lean tracks, but first, I would like to mention that last month, we were honored at the Lean and Six Sigma Conference with its first ever Deployment of the Year award, specifically recognizing the depth, breadth and scope of our RCI rollout across the company. This is tremendous recognition for us, though we always remind ourselves that RCI is a journey that never ends and we continue to have a long runway of opportunity.
From a growth standpoint, the Dr Pepper smaller packages growth lean track has closed over 1,100 distribution voids in a large retailer. And in the Plains region, our allied brand distribution and availability track netted almost a 9% increase in distribution of priority SKUs. And these are great examples of engaging our partners in the value chain and together using proven process improvement methods to drive even better levels of retail execution.
Our 7UP lean track is under way, and the team has done extensive analytic rigor on the brand and they have gone to in some of our larger markets. We've got multiple kaizens in key markets scheduled over the next couple of months where we will identify and attack the root causes of the brand's recent performance in those markets. And we're seeing early wins in our productivity track for reducing both DSD driver turnover and nonworking media spend. Again, just a very few examples of the improvement initiatives taking place across our business every single day.
Now moving to 2016 guidance. We expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%, which is down from our prior guidance of a 2% headwind. 
We also now expect EPS to be in the high end of our previously communicated range of $4.20 to $4.30. This is inclusive of about a 2.5-point headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 4% that we had originally expected. 
We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Given the category headwinds in CSDs, we expect CSDs to be about flat, while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business in Mexico. We still expect continued growth from our noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio. 
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be over 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase, and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods, given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 0.5% deflationary on a constant volume-mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum, but also now reflects less of a headwind on corn than we originally expected, driven primarily by more favorable pricing of corn coproducts from which we derive our net price for corn. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods, and also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all of the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. And while we still expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. That said, we still believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. 
Based on some recent favorable marketing return on investment results and incremental opportunities across our ales, sparkling waters and juice brands, we're spending about $5 million more in marketing than we initially expected. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we recorded an unplanned arbitration award of $4 million related to our Mexican joint venture and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. As I also mentioned earlier, this charge is included in core results.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing.  Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales.  We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Second, as Larry mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, over half of our growth in brand Dr Pepper in the first quarter was driven by timing of sales that were planned for in the second quarter. Third, we'll be potentially terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which we have planned for in the second quarter. Fourth, while we expect commodities to be about 0.5 point deflationary on a constant volume-mix basis for the full year, the deflation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Fifth, based on timing of prior year true-ups, the $20 million increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs will be heavily weighted in both the second and third quarters. And finally, while we expected a reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter, driven by media and programming shifts, we are expecting increased investment in both the second and third quarters. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

Let me just get rid of the -- the concentrate question, as we said in our annual January 1 concentrate increase on concentrate and syrup prices go up as well, we said is about 40 basis points in pricing spread over all of our $6 billion-plus in sales. So there's nothing new there. I mean, the timing issue in the first quarter with shipment had no impact on pricing per se. It's simply the quantity of syrup. And the accrual is the timing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we accrued a little more in the first quarter. It's going to come back in the third quarter. Let me shift over to marketing and again, it was really about specific opportunities in ale, sparkling waters and juices. There's going to be some specific emphasis on Mott's. So let me just pullback and sort of deal with this timing issue in the first quarter as well. we'll get that off the table. One of the things we talked last year ago and continue to talk about some of the updated strategy work we've been doing for our key brands. And I would tell you through that process, which took us all of last year, we came up with some different conclusions about communications and messaging for many -- for some of our brands that I would tell you were different from some of our prior points of view. So we took the input from initially what was 35,000 consumer surveys that I think got culled down to roughly 25,000 good surveys about how they felt about our brands on a number of dimensions. And as a result, we're changing our communication messaging. And quite frankly because we've decided to make some changes, it's taking a little more time than we originally -- not more time than we thought because we planned for this. But the lighter spend in the first quarter was really a function of that new time line for us to create a new creative. And so we planned for that. We're going to still spend 7.5% of sales this year, like we always have. as I said in the incremental $5 million, these opportunities came up. Schweppes, that category is growing double digits, some insights on Mott's. And so I would call that sort of evolution, not -- nothing -- evolution of our return on investment insights and process to tell us where best to spend some money. In this case, we didn't just shift, we added $5 million."

So when you look at the absolute level of first quarter margins for Packaged Beverages, I think the one call that I would give you that's worth about, and you're talking of course about operating margins, probably the -- they're a piece of the $12 million marketing benefit. Because we know that's timing, probably helped our operating margins by about 50 basis points, okay? So there -- so given their current mix, given current levels of input costs, even given current levels of foreign exchange because we have our WD Canada business as part of the segment. So taking current levels in the first quarter, we sort of get the margins you get, less I would say 50 basis points for the marketing shift. What we like about Packaged Beverages, and the reason that margins have ticked up the way they have, is that they're getting this extraordinary benefit from first and foremost, mix. And as I said earlier, they're benefiting from the allied brands. This is good business for us and it's good business for our brand owners. And in our WD portfolio, the products that are growing are some of our best margin products. As you know -- and oh, by the way, I would say we will take growth in all of those brands and traded them all day long for whether it's decline in Hawaiian Punch or for that matter, decline in 7UP. So enormous beneficial mix, and that of course, I sai d they've got a point in pricing. that pricing environment seems to be pretty good. Year-over-year, commodities and fuel are pretty important to them, okay, and drove probably $18 million or so of year-over-year improvement. But nevertheless, those are the prices of commodities today. That is the price of fuel today. oil is going up a little bit. And saw there 4 the current margin structure I'd say it looks to be where it is in Q1, absent what I'd call out as timing."

We had a solid start to the year, and as always, I'm proud of our teams for delivering against our strategy and key priorities. Our brands are strong, and we're consistently focused on driving improved execution in the marketplace. RCI continues to embed deeper into the organization and deliver growth and productivity across the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 4 points of positive mix and price. We were able to achieve growth across our portfolio in both CSDs and noncarbs, with both increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper increased 4%, reflecting growth in our fountain foodservice business. Over half of this growth was due to timing of sales to a large bottling customer that we had planned for in the second quarter. 
Our Core 4 brands increased 3% -- decreased 3% as growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines of 7UP, Sunkist Soda and A&W. Crush and Schweppes grew 6% and 10%, respectively, on increased promotional activity at a large retailer. Squirt grew by 3% and Peñafiel increased 5% in the quarter while lapping 20% growth a year ago. All other CSDs decreased 1% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple increased 4% in the quarter; Hawaiian Punch decreased 7% as planned, driven by price increases on single-serve packages; and Mott's decreased 4%, again as planned, on lower promotional activity and continued declines in the juice category. Clamato grew 10% in the quarter, primarily on increased promotional activity, and our water category grew by 22%. Aguafiel grew double digits. And continued strong contribution to growth were also driven by a number of our allied brands, including Bai and FIJI. All other noncarb brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
Our allied brand strategy is enabling us to quickly capture growth in emerging categories. I am pleased to announce 2 new recent partnerships, CORE Hydration, a purified water rich with elctrolytes and minerals; and High Brew, a cold brew, ready-to-drink coffee. We believe both products have strong market potential.
Building our brands is a key component of our strategy. And our calendar for the summer is packed with programs that will engage and connect with our consumers as well as drive excitement with our retail and bottling partners. First, I hope you all saw recently that Beverage Digest reported that regular Dr Pepper is now the fourth largest CSD brand in the category, surpassing a large competitive flavor brand. It's a good reminder that we compete in flavored CSDs, not colas. And Nielsen data shows that flavors over the past 2 are up in retail dollars by almost 4%.  
That is an exciting win for the Dr Pepper brand, and our summer lineup of activity will keep the momentum going. Our Pick Your Pepper program will offer millennial consumers 150 one-of-a-kind labels on 20-ounce single-serve bottles that will allow them to express their individuality. 
We know that our Li'l Sweet campaign was a huge success for Diet Dr Pepper last year. So we brought them back for an encore performance, highlighting the great sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. 
We're also driving a big push behind Cherry Dr Pepper, with a new media campaign inclusive of both traditional and digital media and activation elements at retail. We know that this product is an entry point into the brand, specifically with Hispanic consumers, so we're leveraging to bring new consumers into the franchise. 
We're rolling out 7.5-ounce slim cans across our key CSD brands and our DSD network. As we know, this is a consumer-preferred package. We'll get Schweppes sparkling waters into more consumers' hands with incremental trial activity. And we'll top off the summer with incremental media and activity behind Cherry 7UP.
Mott's will feature characters from Universal's The Secret Life of Pets movie on several key products throughout the summer and will drive incremental points of interruption with a new patriotic Snapple LTO. We've also added 2 new flavors to our straight up tea lineup, Honey Green and Herbal rodeos. And to spice up summer gatherings, Clamato will partner with an authentic Mexican beer as the original michelada mixer. I'm sure you'll agree we've got a great lineup for the summer.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up",1634,"Thank you, Larry. 
Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up 190 basis points. Core EPS was up 16% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 14% and core EPS was up 17%. All in all, some good results for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some further detail. Reported net sales increased 2% in the first quarter on 3 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over a 1.5 points of unfavorable foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix as a result of our higher proportion this year of concentrate sales to finished goods case sales. Net sales was further reduced by just over 0.5 point for higher discounts driven by accrual timing in our fountain foodservice business that will reverse in the third quarter of the year. 
Reported gross margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.5% last year to 59.5% this year, of which 30 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. And continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI, increased gross margins by another 40 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing in the quarter also increased gross margins by 40 basis points. The effect of mix, mostly product, reduced gross margins by 70 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $6 million on a planned marketing reduction of $12 million, driven by timing of media and programming, favorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in transportation costs driven by lower fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary and certain other increases in operating expenses. Furthermore, included in our core SG&A is a $4 million arbitration award associated with our Mexican joint venture. Specific to our LAB segment, this charge reduced their reported operating income growth by 24 percentage points. Depreciation and amortization declined $1 million in the quarter. 
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher rates from our January debt refinancing and an overall higher debt balance. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last year.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $177 million, up $76 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of working capital and the increase in net income. Capital spending was $27 million compared to $20 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $269 million with $179 million in shares repurchased and $90 million in dividends paid.
Moving on to RCI, I'll give a brief update on the progress of a few of our lean tracks, but first, I would like to mention that last month, we were honored at the Lean & Six Sigma World Conference with its first ever Deployment of the Year award, specifically recognizing the depth, breadth and scope of our RCI rollout across the company. This is tremendous recognition for us, though we always remind ourselves that RCI is a journey that never ends and we continue to have a long runway of opportunity.
From a growth standpoint, the Dr Pepper smaller packages growth lean track has closed over 1,100 distribution voids in a large retailer. And in the Plains region, our allied brand distribution and availability track netted almost a 9% increase in distribution of priority SKUs. And these are great examples of engaging our partners in the value chain and together using proven process and proven methods to drive even better levels of retail execution.
Our 7UP lean track is under way, and the team has done extensive analytic rigor on the brand and they have gone to gemba in some of our larger markets. We've got multiple kaizens in key markets scheduled over the next couple of months where we will identify and attack the root causes of the brand's recent performance in those markets. And we're seeing early wins on our productivity track for reducing both DSD driver turnover and nonworking media spend. Again, just a very few examples of the improvement initiatives taking place across our business every single day.
Now moving to 2016 guidance. We expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%, which is down from our prior guidance of a 2% headwind. 
We also now expect EPS to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of $4.20 to $4.30. This is inclusive of about a 2.5-point headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 4% that we had originally expected. 
We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Given the category headwinds in CSDs, we expect CSDs to be about flat while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business in Mexico. We still expect continued growth from our other noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio. 
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be over 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase, and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 0.5% deflationary on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum, but also now reflects less of a headwind on corn than we originally expected, driven primarily by more favorable pricing of corn coproducts from which we derive our net price for corn. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods, and also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all of the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. And while we still expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. That said, we still believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. 
Based on some recent favorable marketing return on investment results and incremental opportunities across our ales, sparkling waters and juice brands, we're spending about $5 million more in marketing than we initially expected. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we recorded an unplanned arbitration award of $4 million related to our Mexican joint venture and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. As I also mentioned earlier, this charge is included in core results.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Second, as Larry mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, over half of our growth in brand Dr Pepper in the first quarter was driven by timing of sales that were planned for in the second quarter. Third, we'll be potentially terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which we had planned for in the second quarter. Fourth, while we expect commodities to be about 0.5 point deflationary on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, the deflation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Fifth, based on timing of prior year true-ups, the $20 million increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs will be heavily weighted in both the second and third quarters. And finally, while we expected a reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter, driven by media and programming shifts, we are expecting increased investment in both the second and third quarters. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

We're not changing our guidance. We like the performance in the first quarter. We like the execution. We like where our strategy is taking us, and so we're very pleased. And quite frankly, it's just early in the year to think about changes at this point."

Let me just get rid of the -- the concentrate question, as we said in our annual January 1 concentrate price increase on concentrate and syrup prices go up as well, we said is about 40 basis points in pricing spread over all of our $6 billion-plus in sales. So there's nothing new there. I mean, the timing issue in the first quarter with the shipment we had, no impact on pricing per se. It's simply with the quantity of syrup. And the accrual, it's the timing, as I said in my prepared remarks. We accrued a little more in the first quarter. It's going to come back in the third quarter. Let me shift over to marketing and again, it was really about specific opportunities in ale, sparkling waters and juices. There's going to be some specific emphasis on Mott's. But let me pullback and just sort of deal with this timing issue in the first quarter as well. We'll get that off the table. One of the things -- we talked last year ago and we'll continue to talk about some of the updated strategy work we've been doing for our key brands. And I would tell you through that process, which took us all of last year, we came up with some different conclusions about communications and messaging for many -- for some of our brands that I would tell you were different from some of our prior points of view. So we took the input from initially what was 35,000 consumer surveys that I think got culled down to roughly 25,000 good surveys about how they felt about our brands on a number of dimensions. And as a result, we're changing our communication messaging. And quite frankly because we've decided to make some changes, it's taking a little more time than we originally -- well, we -- not more time than we thought because we planned for this. But the lighter spend in the first quarter was really a function of that new time line for us to create the new creative, and so we planned for that. We're going to still spend 7.5% of sales this year, like we always have. And as I said in the incremental $5 million, these opportunities came up. Schweppes, that category is growing double digits, some insights on Mott's. And so I would call that sort of evolution, not -- nothing we -- evolution of our return on investment insights and process to tell us where best to spend some money. In this case, we didn't just shift, we added $5 million."

So there's also -- there's a piece here that we think is very positive for us in terms of our improving executional capabilities that are helping our core brands. I think everybody sometimes takes for granted that everybody's execution is at the same level. We may not be the best. We're not declaring we're the best, but we are pleased with the improvements we're making, and that does help grow our core."

Those who have been around a number of years ago, probably 4 or 5 years ago, we were probably more aggressively expanding and probably spending more money than we should have, and I wouldn't say the strategy was working so well. So we've reined it a little bit. It's a little more targeted now. It's a little more strategic now. We're not in a rush. We want to capture market opportunities well, not hurriedly. As you know, the business there is doing real well. The Peñafiel business has continued to do well. Some say, ""Why did the brand only grow 5%?"" Well, it grew 20% last year? At 5%, when we looked around, looks still pretty good relative to the market down there. As you know, we're building a new water plant. We announced that I think at the beginning of the year and the last year, because we are simply out of capacity, and that's outside Mexico City. So all in all, our team in Mexico is doing really well. The business is performing extraordinary well. As I said this morning, absent the JV settlement charge, their 6% top line would have driven 24% operating profit growth. We like that model a lot."

So let me help you -- guide you guys here. So when you look at the absolute level of first quarter margins for Packaged Beverages, I think the one call that I would give you that's worth -- about, and you're talking, of course, about operating margins, probably the -- they're a piece of the $12 million marketing benefit because we know that's timing, probably helped their operating margins by about 50 basis points, okay? So there -- so given their current mix, given current levels of input costs, even given current levels of foreign exchange because we have our WD Canada business as part of the segment. So taking current levels in the first quarter, you sort of get the margins you get, less, I would say, 50 basis points for the marketing shift. What we like about Packaged Beverages, and the reason their margins have ticked up the way they have, is that they're getting this extraordinary benefit from really first and foremost, mix. And as I said earlier, they're benefiting from the allied brands. This is good business for us and it's good business for our brand owners. And in our WD portfolio, the products that are growing are some of our best margin products, as you know -- and oh, by the way, I would say we will take growth in all of those brands and trade them all day long for whether it's decline in Hawaiian Punch or for that matter, decline in 7UP. So enormous beneficial mix, and then of course, as I said earlier they've got a point in pricing. Net pricing environment seems to be pretty good. Year-over-year, commodities and fuel were pretty important to them, okay? And drove probably about $18 million or so of year-over-year improvement. But nevertheless, those are the prices of commodities today. That is the price of fuel today. That's the fact that oil is going up a little bit. And so, therefore the current margin structure I say is it looks to be where it is in Q1, absent one item that I'd call out as timing."

That's why we spend a lot of time with these management teams, understanding their strategy, the opportunities that they see. Does it square up with the opportunity we see? Are they credible? What have they done in the past? There's a whole checklist we go through. And at some level, we want them to be able to fund the costs that they need to fund as the brand owner, and not come from us for one reason that if we had to fund these businesses early stage, we would therefore have to buy them or acquire a majority position, which would cause the spirit of the company to go away. The ownership would leave. It would just become a nascent brand inside Dr Pepper that we would have to, in essence, grow from a very, very low base. That's why we're not doing this because we don't -- there's no proven model. You may have won, but across this space with our key competitors that demonstrates anybody's ability to really create a breakthrough brand, however, you want to define that, a breakthrough brand de novo. And so this is -- the whole strategy is about capturing the passion and spirit of these people and bring something to the party that they absolutely need and we need. And like I said, the pipeline is full of opportunities. I don't know how we could ever have had an innovation pipeline like we're seeing through allied brand. Would we have ever invented coconut water, for example and had the success of Vita Coco? Would we have ever created a Bai and had the success of a Bai? If I -- if Larry and I had come to you and said, and here are the examples of BODYARMOR, we are now going to compete in sports drinks. You know that category and you know it's a highly competitive category. Anybody that would have said, ""You're crazy,"" and they would have had the right to say that. But here, we come with a brand that we don't capital at risk in any meaningful way. And yet we have a chance -- but that management team, which is a very credible management team, has -- we think they've got a point of difference. We think they've got a great strategy. They've got a great approach from the product to the pricing to the positioning, to how they're going to approach the channels. This is the opportunity. And some may go over time. But I'm telling you, we are just sort of full. We almost get to the point we decide how many things we can handle. And using RCI, we're deploying a lot of RCI to this to help us create certain onboarding process, if you will, or as a mentioned, one here distribution availability to help us even execute on these better."

We had a solid start to the year, and as always, I'm proud of our teams for delivering against our strategy and key priorities. Our brands are strong, and we're consistently focused on driving improved execution in the marketplace. RCI continues to embed deeper into the organization and deliver growth and productivity across the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 4 points of positive mix and price. We were able to achieve growth across our portfolio in both CSDs and noncarbs, with both increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper increased 4%, reflecting growth in our fountain foodservice business. Over half of this growth was due to timing of sales to a large bottling customer that we had planned for in the second quarter. 
Our Core 4 brands increased 3% -- decreased 3% as growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines of 7UP, Sunkist Soda and A&W. Crush and Schweppes grew 6% and 10%, respectively, on increased promotional activity at a large retailer. Squirt grew by 3% and Peñafiel increased 5% in the quarter while lapping 20% growth a year ago. All other CSDs decreased 1% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple increased 4% in the quarter; Hawaiian Punch decreased 7% as planned, driven by price increases on single-serve packages; and Mott's decreased 4%, again as planned, on lower promotional activity and continued declines in the juice category. Clamato grew 10% in the quarter, primarily on increased promotional activity, and our water category grew by 22%. Aguafiel grew double digits. And continued strong contribution to growth were also driven by a number of our allied brands, including Bai and FIJI. All other noncarb brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
Our allied brand strategy is enabling us to quickly capture growth in emerging categories. I am pleased to announce 2 new recent partnerships, CORE Hydration, a purified water rich with elctrolytes and minerals; and High Brew, a cold brew, ready-to-drink coffee. We believe both products have strong market potential.
Building our brands is a key component of our strategy. And our calendar for the summer is packed with programs that will engage and connect with our consumers as well as drive excitement with our retail and bottling partners. First, I hope you all saw recently that Beverage Digest reported that regular Dr Pepper is now the fourth largest CSD brand in the category, surpassing a large competitive flavor brand. It's a good reminder that we compete in flavored CSDs, not colas. And Nielsen data shows that flavors over the past 2 are up in retail dollars by almost 4%.  
That is an exciting win for the Dr Pepper brand, and our summer lineup of activity will keep the momentum going. Our Pick Your Pepper program will offer millennial consumers 150 one-of-a-kind labels on 20-ounce single-serve bottles that will allow them to express their individuality. 
We know that our Li'l Sweet campaign was a huge success for Diet Dr Pepper last year. So we brought them back for an encore performance, highlighting the great sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. 
We're also driving a big push behind Cherry Dr Pepper, with a new media campaign inclusive of both traditional and digital media and activation elements at retail. We know that this product is an entry point into the brand, specifically with Hispanic consumers, so we're leveraging to bring new consumers into the franchise. 
We're rolling out 7.5-ounce slim cans across our key CSD brands and our DSD network. As we know, this is a consumer-preferred package. We'll get Schweppes sparkling waters into more consumers' hands with incremental trial activity. And we'll top off the summer with incremental media and activity behind Cherry 7UP.
Mott's will feature characters from Universal's The Secret Life of Pets movie on several key products throughout the summer and will drive incremental points of interruption with a new patriotic Snapple LTO. We've also added 2 new flavors to our straight up tea lineup, Honey Green and Herbal rodeos. And to spice up summer gatherings, Clamato will partner with an authentic Mexican beer as the original michelada mixer. I'm sure you'll agree we've got a great lineup for the summer.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up",1634,"Thank you, Larry. 
Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up 190 basis points. Core EPS was up 16% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 14% and core EPS was up 17%. All in all, some good results for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some further detail. Reported net sales increased 2% in the first quarter on 3 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over a 1.5 points of unfavorable foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix as a result of our higher proportion this year of concentrate sales to finished goods case sales. Net sales was further reduced by just over 0.5 point for higher discounts driven by accrual timing in our fountain foodservice business that will reverse in the third quarter of the year. 
Reported gross margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.5% last year to 59.5% this year, of which 30 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. And continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI, increased gross margins by another 40 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing in the quarter also increased gross margins by 40 basis points. The effect of mix, mostly product, reduced gross margins by 70 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $6 million on a planned marketing reduction of $12 million, driven by timing of media and programming, favorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in transportation costs driven by lower fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary and certain other increases in operating expenses. Furthermore, included in our core SG&A is a $4 million arbitration award associated with our Mexican joint venture. Specific to our LAB segment, this charge reduced their reported operating income growth by 24 percentage points. Depreciation and amortization declined $1 million in the quarter. 
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher rates from our January debt refinancing and an overall higher debt balance. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last year.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $177 million, up $76 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of working capital and the increase in net income. Capital spending was $27 million compared to $20 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $269 million with $179 million in shares repurchased and $90 million in dividends paid.
Moving on to RCI, I'll give a brief update on the progress of a few of our lean tracks, but first, I would like to mention that last month, we were honored at the Lean & Six Sigma World Conference with its first ever Deployment of the Year award, specifically recognizing the depth, breadth and scope of our RCI rollout across the company. This is tremendous recognition for us, though we always remind ourselves that RCI is a journey that never ends and we continue to have a long runway of opportunity.
From a growth standpoint, the Dr Pepper smaller packages growth lean track has closed over 1,100 distribution voids in a large retailer. And in the Plains region, our allied brand distribution and availability track netted almost a 9% increase in distribution of priority SKUs. And these are great examples of engaging our partners in the value chain and together using proven process and proven methods to drive even better levels of retail execution.
Our 7UP lean track is under way, and the team has done extensive analytic rigor on the brand and they have gone to gemba in some of our larger markets. We've got multiple kaizens in key markets scheduled over the next couple of months where we will identify and attack the root causes of the brand's recent performance in those markets. And we're seeing early wins on our productivity track for reducing both DSD driver turnover and nonworking media spend. Again, just a very few examples of the improvement initiatives taking place across our business every single day.
Now moving to 2016 guidance. We expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%, which is down from our prior guidance of a 2% headwind. 
We also now expect EPS to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of $4.20 to $4.30. This is inclusive of about a 2.5-point headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 4% that we had originally expected. 
We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Given the category headwinds in CSDs, we expect CSDs to be about flat while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business in Mexico. We still expect continued growth from our other noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio. 
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be over 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase, and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 0.5% deflationary on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum, but also now reflects less of a headwind on corn than we originally expected, driven primarily by more favorable pricing of corn coproducts from which we derive our net price for corn. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods, and also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all of the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. And while we still expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. That said, we still believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. 
Based on some recent favorable marketing return on investment results and incremental opportunities across our ales, sparkling waters and juice brands, we're spending about $5 million more in marketing than we initially expected. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we recorded an unplanned arbitration award of $4 million related to our Mexican joint venture and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. As I also mentioned earlier, this charge is included in core results.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Second, as Larry mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, over half of our growth in brand Dr Pepper in the first quarter was driven by timing of sales that were planned for in the second quarter. Third, we'll be potentially terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which we had planned for in the second quarter. Fourth, while we expect commodities to be about 0.5 point deflationary on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, the deflation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Fifth, based on timing of prior year true-ups, the $20 million increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs will be heavily weighted in both the second and third quarters. And finally, while we expected a reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter, driven by media and programming shifts, we are expecting increased investment in both the second and third quarters. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

Yes, it's Marty. Let me just get rid of the -- the concentrate question, as we said in our annual January 1 concentrate price increase on concentrate and syrup prices go up as well, we said is about 40 basis points in pricing spread over all of our $6 billion-plus in sales. So there's nothing new there. I mean, the timing issue in the first quarter with the shipment we had, no impact on pricing per se. It's simply with the quantity of syrup. And the accrual, it's the timing, as I said in my prepared remarks. We accrued a little more in the first quarter. It's going to come back in the third quarter. Let me shift over to marketing and again, it was really about specific opportunities in ale, sparkling waters and juices. There's going to be some specific emphasis on Mott's. But let me pullback and just sort of deal with this timing issue in the first quarter as well. We'll get that off the table. One of the things -- we talked last year and we'll continue to talk about some of the updated strategy work we've been doing for our key brands. And I would tell you through that process, which took us all of last year, we came up with some different conclusions about communications and messaging for many -- for some of our brands that I would tell you were different from some of our prior points of view. So we took the input from initially what was 35,000 consumer surveys that I think got culled down to roughly 25,000 good surveys about how they felt about our brands on a number of dimensions. And as a result, we're changing our communication messaging. And quite frankly because we've decided to make some changes, it's taking a little more time than we originally -- well, we -- not more time than we thought because we planned for this. But the lighter spend in the first quarter was really a function of that new time line for us to create the new creative, and so we planned for that. We're going to still spend 7.5% of sales this year, like we always have. And as I said in the incremental $5 million, these opportunities came up. Schweppes, that category is growing double digits, some insights on Mott's. And so I would call that sort of evolution, not -- nothing we -- evolution of our return on investment insights and process to tell us where best to spend some money. In this case, we didn't just shift, we added $5 million."

Judy, in terms of -- since you asked, in terms of expanded opportunities, as Larry said, we -- no, the pipeline is full of opportunities, as I said last time. We'll be entering a new category for us on the distribution side, ready-to-drink coffee. It's a $2 billion category. Just a lot happening in that category. You'll see the High Brew brand. We're going to -- that's going to phase in. They have some existing distributors. Some we can take over immediately, some over time. But we've begun the process. And of course, CORE Hydration is getting traction. A lot happening, of course, in that category. It's a somewhat crowded category, but some would say you can't have too few waters given the growth in that category.

So of course, this is about innovating with a very, very fast-changing consumer.

Because if we look at the margin for Packaged Beverages, historically, Q1's been a dramatically lower margin -- not dramatically, but let's say 150 to 200 basis points lower than the full year margin. If we look at it this year, you've obviously got a big bump up there. If we see even remotely close similar sequential improvement in the margin over the balance of the year, as we've seen in past years, that would imply just tremendous margin upside here. So can you talk a little bit about specifically the drivers there, maybe some mix impacts, raw materials, and how we should see that going through the year?"

So let me help you -- guide you guys here. So when you look at the absolute level of first quarter margins for Packaged Beverages, I think the one call that I would give you that's worth -- about, and you're talking, of course, about operating margins, probably the -- they're a piece of the $12 million marketing benefit because we know that's timing, probably helped their operating margins by about 50 basis points, okay? So there -- so given their current mix, given current levels of input costs, even given current levels of foreign exchange because we have our WD Canada business as part of the segment. So taking current levels in the first quarter, you sort of get the margins you get, less, I would say, 50 basis points for the marketing shift. What we like about Packaged Beverages, and the reason their margins have ticked up the way they have, is that they're getting this extraordinary benefit from really first and foremost, mix. And as I said earlier, they're benefiting from the allied brands. This is good business for us and it's good business for our brand owners. And in our WD portfolio, the products that are growing are some of our best margin products, as you know -- and oh, by the way, I would say we will take growth in all of those brands and trade them all day long for whether it's decline in Hawaiian Punch or for that matter, decline in 7UP. So enormous beneficial mix, and then of course, as I said earlier they've got a point in pricing. Net pricing environment seems to be pretty good. Year-over-year, commodities and fuel were pretty important to them, okay? And drove probably about $18 million or so of year-over-year improvement. But nevertheless, those are the prices of commodities today. That is the price of fuel today. That's the fact that oil is going up a little bit. And so, therefore the current margin structure I say is it looks to be where it is in Q1, absent one item that I'd call out as timing."

Look, so first of all, the small equity positions we take here carry no real governance rights, whether they be board seats, managerial strategy, what have you. That's why we spend a lot of time with these management teams, understanding their strategy, the opportunities that they see. Does it square up with the opportunity we see? Are they credible? What have they done in the past? There's a whole checklist we go through. And at some level, we want them to be able to fund the costs that they need to fund as the brand owner, and not come from us for one reason that if we had to fund these businesses early stage, we would therefore have to buy them or acquire a majority position, which would cause the spirit of the company to go away. The ownership would leave. It would just become a nascent brand inside Dr Pepper that we would have to, in essence, grow from a very, very low base. That's why we're not doing this because we don't -- there's no proven model. You may have won, but across this space with our key competitors that demonstrates anybody's ability to really create a breakthrough brand, however, you want to define that, a breakthrough brand de novo. And so this is -- the whole strategy is about capturing the passion and spirit of these people and bring something to the party that they absolutely need and we need. And like I said, the pipeline is full of opportunities. I don't know how we could ever have had an innovation pipeline like we're seeing through allied brand. Would we have ever invented coconut water, for example and had the success of Vita Coco? Would we have ever created a Bai and had the success of a Bai? If I -- if Larry and I had come to you and said, and here are the examples of BODYARMOR, we are now going to compete in sports drinks. You know that category and you know it's a highly competitive category. Anybody that would have said, ""You're crazy,"" and they would have had the right to say that. But here, we come with a brand that we don't capital at risk in any meaningful way. And yet we have a chance -- but that management team, which is a very credible management team, has -- we think they've got a point of difference. We think they've got a great strategy. They've got a great approach from the product to the pricing to the positioning, to how they're going to approach the channels. This is the opportunity. And some may go over time. But I'm telling you, we are just sort of full. We almost get to the point we decide how many of these things we can handle. And using RCI, we're deploying a lot of RCI to this to help us create certain onboarding process, if you will, or as I mentioned one here distribution availability to help us even execute on these better."

We had a solid start to the year, and as always, I'm proud of our teams for delivering against our strategy and key priorities. Our brands are strong, and we're consistently focused on driving improved execution in the marketplace. RCI continues to embed deeper into the organization and deliver growth and productivity across the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 4 points of positive mix and price. We were able to achieve growth across our portfolio in both CSDs and noncarbs, with both increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper increased 4%, reflecting growth in our fountain foodservice business. Over half of this growth was due to timing of sales to a large bottling customer that we had planned for in the second quarter. 
Our Core 4 brands increased 3% -- decreased 3% as growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines of 7UP, Sunkist Soda and A&W. Crush and Schweppes grew 6% and 10%, respectively, on increased promotional activity at a large retailer. Squirt grew by 3% and Peñafiel increased 5% in the quarter while lapping 20% growth a year ago. All other CSDs decreased 1% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple increased 4% in the quarter; Hawaiian Punch decreased 7% as planned, driven by price increases on single-serve packages; and Mott's decreased 4%, again as planned, on lower promotional activity and continued declines in the juice category. Clamato grew 10% in the quarter, primarily on increased promotional activity, and our water category grew by 22%. Aguafiel grew double digits. And continued strong contribution to growth were also driven by a number of our allied brands, including Bai and FIJI. All other noncarb brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
Our allied brand strategy is enabling us to quickly capture growth in emerging categories. I am pleased to announce 2 new recent partnerships, CORE Hydration, a purified water rich with elctrolytes and minerals; and High Brew, a cold brew, ready-to-drink coffee. We believe both products have strong market potential.
Building our brands is a key component of our strategy. And our calendar for the summer is packed with programs that will engage and connect with our consumers as well as drive excitement with our retail and bottling partners. First, I hope you all saw recently that Beverage Digest reported that regular Dr Pepper is now the fourth largest CSD brand in the category, surpassing a large competitive flavor brand. It's a good reminder that we compete in flavored CSDs, not colas. And Nielsen data shows that flavors over the past 2 are up in retail dollars by almost 4%. 
That is an exciting win for the Dr Pepper brand, and our summer lineup of activity will keep the momentum going. Our Pick Your Pepper program will offer millennial consumers 150 one-of-a-kind labels on 20-ounce single-serve bottles that will allow them to express their individuality. 
We know that our Li'l Sweet campaign was a huge success for Diet Dr Pepper last year. So we brought them back for an encore performance, highlighting the great sweet taste of Diet Dr Pepper. 
We're also driving a big push behind Cherry Dr Pepper, with a new media campaign inclusive of both traditional and digital media and activation elements at retail. We know that this product is an entry point into the brand, specifically with Hispanic consumers, so we're leveraging to bring new consumers into the franchise. 
We're rolling out 7.5-ounce slim cans across our key CSD brands and our DSD network. As we know, this is a consumer-preferred package. We'll get Schweppes sparkling waters into more consumers' hands with incremental trial activity. And we'll top off the summer with incremental media and activity behind Cherry 7UP.
Mott's will feature characters from Universal's The Secret Life of Pets movie on several key products throughout the summer and will drive incremental points of interruption with a new patriotic Snapple LTO. We've also added 2 new flavors to our straight up tea lineup, Honey Green and Herbal rodeos. And to spice up summer gatherings, Clamato will partner with an authentic Mexican beer as the original michelada mixer. I'm sure you'll agree we've got a great lineup for the summer.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let me begin with a high-level financial summary of the quarter. Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Currency-neutral net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 13% and core operating margin was 20.6%, up 190 basis points. Core EPS was up 16% in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, core operating income was up 14% and core EPS was up 17%. All in all, some good results for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some further detail. Reported net sales increased 2% in the first quarter on 3 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over a 1.5 points of unfavorable foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix as a result of our higher proportion this year of concentrate sales to finished goods case sales. Net sales was further reduced by just over 0.5 point for higher discounts driven by accrual timing in our fountain foodservice business that will reverse in the third quarter of the year. 
Reported gross margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.5% last year to 59.5% this year, of which 30 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. And continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI, increased gross margins by another 40 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing in the quarter also increased gross margins by 40 basis points. The effect of mix, mostly product, reduced gross margins by 70 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, decreased by $6 million on a planned marketing reduction of $12 million, driven by timing of media and programming, favorable foreign currency translation and a reduction in transportation costs driven by lower fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary and certain other increases in operating expenses. Furthermore, included in our core SG&A is a $4 million arbitration award associated with our Mexican joint venture. Specific to our LAB segment, this charge reduced their reported operating income growth by 24 percentage points. Depreciation and amortization declined $1 million in the quarter. 
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher rates from our January debt refinancing and an overall higher debt balance. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last year.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $177 million, up $76 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of working capital and the increase in net income. Capital spending was $27 million compared to $20 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $269 million with $179 million in shares repurchased and $90 million in dividends paid.
Moving on to RCI, I'll give a brief update on the progress of a few of our lean tracks, but first, I would like to mention that last month, we were honored at the Lean & Six Sigma World Conference with its first ever Deployment of the Year award, specifically recognizing the depth, breadth and scope of our RCI rollout across the company. This is tremendous recognition for us, though we always remind ourselves that RCI is a journey that never ends and we continue to have a long runway of opportunity.
From a growth standpoint, the Dr Pepper smaller packages growth lean track has closed over 1,100 distribution voids in a large retailer. And in the Plains region, our allied brand distribution and availability track netted almost a 9% increase in distribution of priority SKUs. And these are great examples of engaging our partners in the value chain and together using proven process and proven methods to drive even better levels of retail execution.
Our 7UP lean track is under way, and the team has done extensive analytic rigor on the brand and they have gone to gemba in some of our larger markets. We've got multiple kaizens in key markets scheduled over the next couple of months where we will identify and attack the root causes of the brand's recent performance in those markets. And we're seeing early wins on our productivity track for reducing both DSD driver turnover and nonworking media spend. Again, just a very few examples of the improvement initiatives taking place across our business every single day.
Now moving to 2016 guidance. We expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%, which is down from our prior guidance of a 2% headwind. 
We also now expect EPS to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of $4.20 to $4.30. This is inclusive of about a 2.5-point headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 4% that we had originally expected. 
We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Given the category headwinds in CSDs, we expect CSDs to be about flat while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business in Mexico. We still expect continued growth from our other noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio. 
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be over 2.5%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase, and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 0.5% deflationary on a constant volume mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum, but also now reflects less of a headwind on corn than we originally expected, driven primarily by more favorable pricing of corn coproducts from which we derive our net price for corn. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods, and also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all of the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $20 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs compared to the more favorable trends we experienced in 2015. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. And while we still expect favorability from lower fuel costs in 2016, we will experience rate increases from our third-party carriers. That said, we still believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. 
Based on some recent favorable marketing return on investment results and incremental opportunities across our ales, sparkling waters and juice brands, we're spending about $5 million more in marketing than we initially expected. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we recorded an unplanned arbitration award of $4 million related to our Mexican joint venture and the possible termination of the Aguafiel 10-liter business. As I also mentioned earlier, this charge is included in core results.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $14 million, driven primarily by our recent debt issuances and refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me highlight a couple of phasing items that will help you update your models.
First, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the course of 2015, our foreign currency headwind will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Second, as Larry mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, over half of our growth in brand Dr Pepper in the first quarter was driven by timing of sales that were planned for in the second quarter. Third, we'll be potentially terminating a distribution agreement on our 10-liter Aguafiel business in Mexico, which we had planned for in the second quarter. Fourth, while we expect commodities to be about 0.5 point deflationary on a constant volume mix basis for the full year, the deflation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Fifth, based on timing of prior year true-ups, the $20 million increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs will be heavily weighted in both the second and third quarters. And finally, while we expected a reduction in marketing investment in the first quarter, driven by media and programming shifts, we are expecting increased investment in both the second and third quarters. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

So there's nothing new there. I mean, the timing issue in the first quarter with the shipment we had, no impact on pricing per se. It's simply with the quantity of syrup. And the accrual, it's the timing, as I said in my prepared remarks. We accrued a little more in the first quarter. It's going to come back in the third quarter. Let me shift over to marketing and again, it was really about specific opportunities in ale, sparkling waters and juices. There's going to be some specific emphasis on Mott's. But let me pullback and just sort of deal with this timing issue in the first quarter as well. We'll get that off the table. One of the things -- we talked last year and we'll continue to talk about some of the updated strategy work we've been doing for our key brands. And I would tell you through that process, which took us all of last year, we came up with some different conclusions about communications and messaging for many -- for some of our brands that I would tell you were different from some of our prior points of view. So we took the input from initially what was 35,000 consumer surveys that I think got culled down to roughly 25,000 good surveys about how they felt about our brands on a number of dimensions. And as a result, we're changing our communication messaging. And quite frankly because we've decided to make some changes, it's taking a little more time than we originally -- well, we -- not more time than we thought because we planned for this. But the lighter spend in the first quarter was really a function of that new time line for us to create the new creative, and so we planned for that. We're going to still spend 7.5% of sales this year, like we always have. And as I said in the incremental $5 million, these opportunities came up. Schweppes, that category is growing double digits, some insights on Mott's. And so I would call that sort of evolution, not -- nothing we -- evolution of our return on investment insights and process to tell us where best to spend some money. In this case, we didn't just shift, we added $5 million."

At 5%, when we looked around, looks still pretty good relative to the market down there. As you know, we're building a new water plant.

So when you look at the absolute level of first quarter margins for Packaged Beverages, I think the one call that I would give you that's worth -- about, and you're talking, of course, about operating margins, probably the -- they're a piece of the $12 million marketing benefit because we know that's timing, probably helped their operating margins by about 50 basis points, okay? So there -- so given their current mix, given current levels of input costs, even given current levels of foreign exchange because we have our WD Canada business as part of the segment. So taking current levels in the first quarter, you sort of get the margins you get, less, I would say, 50 basis points for the marketing shift. What we like about Packaged Beverages, and the reason their margins have ticked up the way they have, is that they're getting this extraordinary benefit from really first and foremost, mix. And as I said earlier, they're benefiting from the allied brands. This is good business for us and it's good business for our brand owners. And in our WD portfolio, the products that are growing are some of our best margin products, as you know -- and oh, by the way, I would say we will take growth in all of those brands and trade them all day long for whether it's decline in Hawaiian Punch or for that matter, decline in 7UP. So enormous beneficial mix, and then of course, as I said earlier they've got a point in pricing. Net pricing environment seems to be pretty good. Year-over-year, commodities and fuel were pretty important to them, okay? And drove probably about $18 million or so of year-over-year improvement. But nevertheless, those are the prices of commodities today. That is the price of fuel today. That's the fact that oil is going up a little bit. And so, therefore the current margin structure I say is it looks to be where it is in Q1, absent one item that I'd call out as timing."

Look, so first of all, the small equity positions we take here carry no real governance rights, whether they be board seats, managerial strategy, what have you. That's why we spend a lot of time with these management teams, understanding their strategy, the opportunities that they see. Does it square up with the opportunity we see? Are they credible? What have they done in the past? There's a whole checklist we go through. And at some level, we want them to be able to fund the costs that they need to fund as the brand owner, and not come from us for one reason that if we had to fund these businesses early stage, we would therefore have to buy them or acquire a majority position, which would cause the spirit of the company to go away. The ownership would leave. It would just become a nascent brand inside Dr Pepper that we would have to, in essence, grow from a very, very low base. That's why we're not doing this because we don't -- there's no proven model. You may have won, but across this space with our key competitors that demonstrates anybody's ability to really create a breakthrough brand, however, you want to define that, a breakthrough brand de novo. And so this is -- the whole strategy is about capturing the passion and spirit of these people and bring something to the party that they absolutely need and we need. And like I said, the pipeline is full of opportunities. I don't know how we could ever have had an innovation pipeline like we're seeing through allied brand. Would we have ever invented coconut water, for example and had the success of Vita Coco? Would we have ever created a Bai and had the success of a Bai? If I -- if Larry and I had come to you and said, and here are the examples of BODYARMOR, we are now going to compete in sports drinks. You know that category and you know it's a highly competitive category. Anybody that would have said, ""You're crazy,"" and they would have had the right to say that. But here, we come with a brand that we don't capital at risk in any meaningful way. And yet we have a chance -- but that management team, which is a very credible management team, has -- we think they've got a point of difference. We think they've got a great strategy. They've got a great approach from the product to the pricing to the positioning, to how they're going to approach the channels. This is the opportunity. And some may go over time. But I'm telling you, we are just sort of full. We almost get to the point we decide how many of these things we can handle. And using RCI, we're deploying a lot of RCI to this to help us create certain onboarding process, if you will, or as I mentioned one here distribution availability to help us even execute on these better."

Once again, we posted another solid quarter as our teams continue to relentlessly focus against our strategy. We're on track with driving integrated communications and execution across our priority brands and RCI continues to permeate throughout the organization and drive sustainable financial benefits.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 1% on almost 4 points of positive mix and price. Volumes grew across our portfolio with CSDs increasing by 1% and noncarbs increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 1% in the quarter as continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business was more than offset by declines in diet. Our Diet Dr Pepper business continues to significantly outperform the diet category, declining at about half the rate of all diets, driven by the strength of our Lil' Sweet campaign.
Our Core 4 brands also declined 1% as over 5% growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines in 7UP, A&W and Sunkist Soda. Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9% respectively, on increased activation at a large retailer. Squirt grew 8% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. and Peñafiel grew 4%. All of the CSD brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple declined 2% as growth from product innovation was more than offset by the effect a year ago of liquidating certain Snapple inventories. As a reminder, Snapple growth in the second quarter last year was 11%. Hawaiian Punch decreased 5%, as expected, driven primarily by price increases on single-serve packages. Mott's was flat in the quarter as growth in sauce was fully offset by decreases in juice driven by price increases on single-serve packages. Clamato grew 14% in the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
Our water category grew 25% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. All of the noncarb brands decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of a Country Time distance.
Building our brands continue to be a critical element of our overall strategy and success and we've got another strong calendar programming that is targeted against our consumer insights for the back half of the year. Our regular Dr Pepper 20 ounce program highlights 150 unique labels that allow consumers to choose their favorite bottle that represents their individuality. While it's early on, we're seeing recent upward trends in our convenient and gas business and our consumers are showcasing their love for the bottles, on social platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. You can also even purchase your preferred bottle on eBay.
As I mentioned earlier, our diet Lil' Sweet campaign continues to drive impressive results for the brand and we'll start college football off strong with heavy media across TV and digital platforms and activation in large national accounts. And new this year, Larry Culpepper, will be tailgating across the country to bring Dr Pepper to every football gathering and is on Dr Pepper van. Our Dr Pepper Cherry push would bring new users into the franchise and consumers are enjoying A&W root beer floats at their summer parties. Core 4 is bringing back Monster famed many cans for Halloween, with an app that will bring the Monsters to life on their smart device.
Canada Dry will continue to capitalize on growth in the ale category with increased media throughout the rest of the year and will activate against Schweppes sparkling waters, honing in on the growing mature age. Snapple will remind consumers to make time for Snapple, with corky new real facts ads and we'll once again bring news to the TL with red, blue election themed LTOs.
Clamato has partnered with authentic Mexican beer to spice up outdoor gatherings as the original enchilada. You may have seen our Mott's secret life of pest page in a market and just in time for back-to-school, Mott's will support schools with bonus box hub for education.
As you've seen, we've got a tremendous amount of activity lined up that engages our consumers and gives our customers and partners programs to rally behind.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,372093665,1013361,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.Sales volume increased 1%. We reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was 2",1613,"Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.
Sales volume increased 1%. We reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was 22.8%, up 70 basis points. Core EPS was up 11% in the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 8% and core EPS was up 12%.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increased 2% on about 2.5 points of favorable product and package mix, just over 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over 1.5% of foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix, as concentrate sales were relatively higher this year.
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 90 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 60 basis points, and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other packaging and ingredient cost reductions, increased gross margins by another 50 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing also increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
The effect of mix, mostly from products purchased from others, reduced gross margins by 100 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, increased by $4 million on inflationary and certain other increases and operating expenses, including a onetime $4 million cost associated with the transition of a certain employee benefit program. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation, a reduction in transportation costs, driven by lower fuel prices, and $7 million of lower marketing investments year-over-year due to timing shifts of brand campaigns. Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million in the quarter.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million, primarily reflecting overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Other income increased by $23 million in the quarter as a result of a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multiemployer pension plan withdraw liability. This gain has been excluded from our core results. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.3% compared to 35.5% last year.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $407 million, net of the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Cash from operating activities was up $58 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of certain working capital amount and the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital spending was $68 million compared to $42 million last year as we expect incrementally to further support our growth in Mexico. Our new mineral water plant north of Mexico City should be operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
For the first 6 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $493 million with 303 million in shares repurchased and $190 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on Rapid Continuous Improvement. Our 2016 lean tracks are in full swing. We've already had over 75 Kaizen events across the organization, and we're seeing wins across the board. Our share a few now. In our Orlando DSD site, driver turnover has been reduced by 44%, driven by improved recruiting, on-boarding and performance management processes. Through this lean track nationally, we're also learning from our drivers other elements of waste that will enable us to further improve the effectiveness of our route delivery system. A job growth safety playbook, developed by our frontline employees, is driving a 25% recordable injury reduction year-over-year in the second quarter, helping drive 12 months trend rates down almost double digits. We've closed over 2,000 boards on Dr Pepper's smaller CSD packages in a large retailer through a similar process we use to close voids on other brands, and certain allied brands, are experiencing both double and triple digit growth rates, partial as a result of our track specifically focused on allied brand distribution and availability. And as I've mentioned before, we have a tremendous amount of our CI activity going on throughout the business in addition to our lean tracks. Branch managers and essential business unit gain 10 hours per week of additional customer-facing time by adapting the RCI principles at standard work. And our Mexican team has improved Peñafiel distribution with our third-party distributors by creating standard work for trade management and point-of-sale.
We have great urgency to improve the performance of brands 7UP. Our lean track is underway. And while there is still a great deal of work to do, the team has diligently focused on the components of brand messaging and execution in local markets. Supporting this is a deep inspection of pricing, packaging, channel and geographic competitive trends alongside those of 7UP. This insight should enable us to begin implementing certain changes in the balance of 2016. There's definitely more to come on 7UP. Again, this are just a very few examples of the vast improvement initiatives taking place across our insider business everyday.
Now let me move on to 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our first half performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the $4.27 to $4.35 range. This is inclusive of what we now expect to be about a 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 2.5% that we had expected previously. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Similar to our previous guidance, we expect CSDs is to be about flat while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember, that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands. However, we still expect continued growth from other noncarb brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation and commodities such as PET and aluminum and as we have previously said, a headwind on corn driven primarily by increases in toll and fees and unfavorable pricing of corn core products, from which we derive our net core price. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $15 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the original $20 million that we had previously expected. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we're also now expecting favorability from lower fuel costs of about $10 million, more than half of which we have already experienced. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the year. This implies a significant uptick in the back half of the year, mostly in the third quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit. Our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $15 million, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, even with the spending for our new plant in Mexico.
We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
Now let me highlight a couple of additional aging items that will help you update your models. First, as previously mentioned, while we expect commodities to be deflationary for the full year, the deflation has already been experienced and our trends are expected to turn flat to slightly up for the balance of the year due to the year-over-year timing of a certain commodity-related rebate. And second, based on timing of prior year true-ups, both the third quarter and fourth quarter will experience an increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs.
With that said, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

We're only going to be effective dealing with retailers other private label, for example, in the geographies where our plants are and assuming those plans have the capacity to do their volumes. Otherwise, transportation mix at sort of a nonstarter. And we're still going to aggressively pursue volumes in our plants where it makes sense to do so. At the same time, we will still do some cold-stacking around the energy category, and that business continues."

Once again, we posted another solid quarter as our teams continued to relentlessly focus against our strategy. We're on track with driving integrated communications and execution across our priority brands and RCI continues to permeate throughout the organization and drive sustainable financial benefits.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 1% on almost 4 points of positive mix and price. Volumes grew across our portfolio, with CSDs increasing by 1% and noncarbs increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 1% in the quarter as continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business was more than offset by declines in diet. Our Diet Dr Pepper business continues to significantly outperform the diet category, declining at about half the rate of all diets, driven by the strength of our Lil' Sweet campaign.
Our Core 4 brands also declined 1%, as over 5% growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines in 7UP, A&W and Sunkist Soda. Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9% respectively, on increased activation at a large retailer. Squirt grew 8% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. and Peñafiel grew 4%. All other CSD brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple declined 2% as growth from product innovation was more than offset by the effect a year ago of liquidating certain Snapple inventories. As a reminder, Snapple growth in the second quarter last year was 11%. Hawaiian Punch decreased 5%, as expected, driven primarily by price increases on single-serve packages. Mott's was flat in the quarter, as growth in sauce was fully offset by decreases in juice, driven by price increases on single-serve packages. Clamato grew 14% in the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
Our water category grew 25% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. All other noncarb brands decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of a Country Time business.
Building our brands continue to be a critical element of our overall strategy and success, and we've got another strong calendar programming that is targeted against our consumer insights for the back half of the year. Our regular Dr Pepper 20 ounce program highlights 150 unique labels that allow consumers to choose their favorite bottle that represents their individuality. Though it's early on, we're seeing recent upward trends in our convenient [ph] and gas business, and our consumers are showcasing their love for the bottles on social platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter. You can also even purchase your preferred bottle on eBay.
As I mentioned earlier, our diet Lil' Sweet campaign continues to drive impressive results for the brand and we'll start college football off strong with heavy media across TV and digital platforms and activation in large national accounts. And new this year, Larry Culpepper, will be tailgating across the country to bring Dr Pepper to every football gathering in his own Dr Pepper van. Our Dr Pepper Cherry push is bringing new users into the franchise and consumers are enjoying A&W root beer floats at their summer parties. Core 4 is bringing back monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device.
Canada Dry will continue to capitalize on growth in the ale category, with increased media throughout the rest of the year and will activate against Schweppes sparkling waters, honing in on the growing mixture occasion. Snapple will remind consumers to make time for Snapple, with quirky new Real Facts ads and we'll once again bring news to the TO with red, blue election-themed LTOs.
Clamato has partnered with an authentic Mexican beer to spice up outdoor gatherings as the original Michelada. You may have seen our Mott's Secret Life of Pets packaging in the market. And just in time for back-to-school, Mott's will support schools with bonus Box Tops for Education.
As you've seen, we've got a tremendous amount of activity lined up that engages our consumers and gives our customers and partners programs to rally behind.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,372093665,1013763,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was",1612,"Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.
Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was 22.8%, up 70 basis points. Core EPS was up 11% in the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 8% and core EPS was up 12%.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increased 2% on about 2.5 points of favorable product and package mix, just over 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over 1.5 points of foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix, as concentrate sales were relatively higher this year.
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 90 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 60 basis points, and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other packaging and ingredient cost reductions, increased gross margins by another 50 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing also increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
The effect of mix, mostly from products purchased from others, reduced gross margins by 100 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, increased by $4 million on inflationary and certain other increases and operating expenses, including a onetime $4 million cost associated with the transition of a certain employee benefit program. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation, a reduction in transportation costs, driven by lower fuel prices and $7 million of lower marketing investments year-over-year due to timing shifts of brand campaigns. Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million in the quarter.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million, primarily reflecting overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Other income increased by $23 million in the quarter as a result of a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability. This gain has been excluded from our core results. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.3% compared to 35.5% last year.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $407 million, net of the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Cash from operating activities was up $58 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of certain working capital amounts and the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital spending was $68 million compared to $42 million last year as we have spent incrementally to further support our growth in Mexico. Our new mineral water plant north of Mexico City should be operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
For the first 6 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $493 million, with $303 million in shares repurchased and $190 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on Rapid Continuous Improvement. Our 2016 lean tracks are in full swing. We've already had over 75 Kaizen events across the organization, and we're seeing wins across the board. I'll share a few now. 
In our Orlando DSD site, driver turnover has been reduced by 44%, driven by improved recruiting, on-boarding and performance management processes. Through this lean track nationally, we're also learning from our drivers other elements of waste that will enable us to further improve the effectiveness of our route delivery system. A job role safety playbook, developed by our frontline employees, is driving a 25% recordable injury reduction year-over-year in the second quarter, helping drive 12 months trend rates down almost double digits. We've closed over 2,000 voids on Dr Pepper's smaller CSD packages in a large retailer through a similar process we used to close voids on other brands. And certain allied brands are experiencing both double and triple-digit growth rates, partially as a result of our tracks specifically focused on allied brand distribution and availability. And as I've mentioned before, we have a tremendous amount of RCI activity going on throughout the business in addition to our lean tracks. Branch managers in our central business units gained 10 hours per week of additional customer-facing time by adapting the RCI principle of standard work. And our Mexican team has improved Peñafiel distribution with our third-party distributors by creating standard work for trade management and point-of-sale.
We have great urgency to improve the performance of brand 7UP. Our lean track is under way. And while there is still a great deal of work to do, the team has diligently focused on the components of brand messaging and execution in local markets. Supporting this is a deep inspection of pricing, packaging, channel and geographic competitive trends alongside those of 7UP. These insights should enable us to begin implementing certain changes in the balance of 2016. There is definitely more to come on 7UP. Again, these are just very few examples of the vast improvement initiatives taking place across our entire business everyday.
Now let me move on to 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our first half performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the $4.27 to $4.35 range. This is inclusive of what we now expect to be about a 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 2.5% that we had expected previously. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Similar to our previous guidance, we expect CSDs to be about flat, while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands. However, we still expect continued growth from other noncarb brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum and, as we have previously said, a headwind on corn, driven primarily by increases in toll-linked fees and unfavorable pricing of corn co-products, from which we derive our net corn price. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $15 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the original $20 million that we had previously expected. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we're also now expecting favorability from lower fuel costs of about $10 million, more than half of which we have already experienced. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the year. This implies a significant uptick in the back half of the year, mostly in the third quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit. Our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $15 million, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, even with the spending for our new plant in Mexico.
We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
Now let me highlight a couple of additional phasing items that will help you update your models. First, as previously mentioned, while we expect commodities to be deflationary for the full year, the deflation has already been experienced and our trends are expected to turn flat to slightly up for the balance of the year due to the year-over-year timing of a certain commodity-related rebate. And second, based on timing of prior year true-ups, both the third quarter and fourth quarter will experience an increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs.
With that said, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

As I've said before, we have a long pipeline of opportunities. In fact, I'll be headed to a meeting right after this call to do a review of that again.

I mean, we've stayed at this level for a little bit. We did raise a little more money. Again, the last year, I referenced that, we took advantage of the yield curve at the time and did an incremental of $250 million at 30 year, about 4.5%. And in essence, that's going into share repurchase this year. If you look at our $650 million to $700 million, it's roughly $250 million higher than our sort of $400 million to $450 million average per year amount.

Brand Dr Pepper decreased 1% in the quarter as continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business was more than offset by declines in diet. Our Diet Dr Pepper business continues to significantly outperform the diet category, declining at about half the rate of all diets, driven by the strength of our Lil' Sweet campaign.
Our Core 4 brands also declined 1%, as over 5% growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines in 7UP, A&W and Sunkist Soda. Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9% respectively, on increased activation at a large retailer. Squirt grew 8% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. and Peñafiel grew 4%. All other CSD brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple declined 2% as growth from product innovation was more than offset by the effect a year ago of liquidating certain Snapple inventories. As a reminder, Snapple growth in the second quarter last year was 11%. Hawaiian Punch decreased 5%, as expected, driven primarily by price increases on single-serve packages. Mott's was flat in the quarter, as growth in sauce was fully offset by decreases in juice, driven by price increases on single-serve packages. Clamato grew 14% in the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
Our water category grew 25% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. All other noncarb brands decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of a Country Time business.
Building our brands continue to be a critical element of our overall strategy and success, and we've got another strong calendar programming that is targeted against our consumer insights for the back half of the year. Our regular Dr Pepper 20 ounce program highlights 150 unique labels that allow consumers to choose their favorite bottle that represents their individuality. Though it's early on, we're seeing recent upward trends in our convenient and gas business, and our consumers are showcasing their love for the bottles on social platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter. You can also even purchase your preferred bottle on eBay.
As I mentioned earlier, our diet Lil' Sweet campaign continues to drive impressive results for the brand and we'll start college football off strong with heavy media across TV and digital platforms and activation in large national accounts. And new this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country to bring Dr Pepper to every football gathering in his own Dr Pepper van. Our Dr Pepper Cherry push is bringing new users into the franchise and consumers are enjoying A&W root beer floats at their summer parties. Core 4 is bringing back monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device.
Canada Dry will continue to capitalize on growth in the ale category, with increased media throughout the rest of the year and will activate against Schweppes sparkling waters, honing in on the growing mixture occasion. Snapple will remind consumers to make time for Snapple, with quirky new Real Facts ads and we'll once again bring news to the TO with red, blue election-themed LTOs.
Clamato has partnered with an authentic Mexican beer to spice up outdoor gatherings as the original Michelada. You may have seen our Mott's Secret Life of Pets packaging in the market. And just in time for back-to-school, Mott's will support schools with bonus Box Tops for Education.
As you've seen, we've got a tremendous amount of activity lined up that engages our consumers and gives our customers and partners programs to rally behind.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,372093665,1013928,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin wa",1613,"Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.
Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was 22.8%, up 70 basis points. Core EPS was up 11% in the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 8% and core EPS was up 12%.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increased 2% on about 2.5 points of favorable product and package mix, just over 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over 1.5 points of foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix, as concentrate sales were relatively higher this year.
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 90 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 60 basis points, and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other packaging and ingredient cost reductions, increased gross margins by another 50 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing also increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
The effect of mix, mostly from products purchased from others, reduced gross margins by 100 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, increased by $4 million on inflationary and certain other increases and operating expenses, including a onetime $4 million cost associated with the transition of a certain employee benefit program. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation, a reduction in transportation costs, driven by lower fuel prices and $7 million of lower marketing investments year-over-year due to timing shifts of brand campaigns. Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million in the quarter.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Other income increased by $23 million in the quarter as a result of a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability. This gain has been excluded from our core results. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.3% compared to 35.5% last year.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $407 million, net of the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Cash from operating activities was up $58 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of certain working capital amounts and the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital spending was $68 million compared to $42 million last year as we have spent incrementally to further support our growth in Mexico. Our new mineral water plant north of Mexico City should be operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
For the first 6 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $493 million, with $303 million in shares repurchased and $190 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on Rapid Continuous Improvement. Our 2016 lean tracks are in full swing. We've already had over 75 Kaizen events across the organization, and we're seeing wins across the board. I'll share a few now. 
In our Orlando DSD site, driver turnover has been reduced by 44%, driven by improved recruiting, on-boarding and performance management processes. Through this lean track nationally, we're also learning from our drivers other elements of waste that will enable us to further improve the effectiveness of our route delivery system. A job role safety playbook, developed by our frontline employees, is driving a 25% recordable injury reduction year-over-year in the second quarter, helping drive 12 months trend rates down almost double digits. We've closed over 2,000 voids on Dr Pepper's smaller CSD packages in a large retailer through a similar process we used to close voids on other brands. And certain allied brands are experiencing both double and triple-digit growth rates, partially as a result of our tracks specifically focused on allied brand distribution and availability. And as I've mentioned before, we have a tremendous amount of RCI activity going on throughout the business in addition to our lean tracks. Branch managers in our central business units gained 10 hours per week of additional customer-facing time by adopting the RCI principle of standard work. And our Mexican team has improved Peñafiel distribution with our third-party distributors by creating standard work for trade management and point-of-sale.
We have great urgency to improve the performance of brand 7UP. Our lean track is under way. And while there is still a great deal of work to do, the team has diligently focused on the components of brand messaging and execution in local markets. Supporting this is a deep inspection of pricing, packaging, channel and geographic competitive trends alongside those of 7UP. These insights should enable us to begin implementing certain changes in the balance of 2016. There is definitely more to come on 7UP. Again, these are just very few examples of the vast improvement initiatives taking place across our entire business everyday.
Now let me move on to 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our first half performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the $4.27 to $4.35 range. This is inclusive of what we now expect to be about a 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 2.5% that we had expected previously. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Similar to our previous guidance, we expect CSDs to be about flat, while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands. However, we still expect continued growth from other noncarb brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum and, as we have previously said, a headwind on corn, driven primarily by increases in toll-linked fees and unfavorable pricing of corn co-products, from which we derive our net corn price. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $15 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the original $20 million that we had previously expected. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we're also now expecting favorability from lower fuel costs of about $10 million, more than half of which we have already experienced. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the year. This implies a significant uptick in the back half of the year, mostly in the third quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit. Our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $15 million, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, even with the spending for our new plant in Mexico.
We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
Now let me highlight a couple of additional phasing items that will help you update your models. First, as previously mentioned, while we expect commodities to be deflationary for the full year, the deflation has already been experienced and our trends are expected to turn flat to slightly up for the balance of the year due to the year-over-year timing of a certain commodity-related rebate. And second, based on timing of prior year true-ups, both the third quarter and fourth quarter will experience an increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs.
With that said, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

We're only going to be effective dealing with retailers on their private label, for example, in the geographies where our plants are, and assuming those plants have the capacity to do their volumes. Otherwise, transportation makes it sort of a nonstarter. And we're still going to aggressively pursue volumes in our plants where it makes sense to do so. At the same time, we still do some co-packing around the energy category, and that business continues."

I don't know if everybody's really trading up to a premium or it's kind of -- you've got flavored teas out there and you have regular teas, and I think that's the big place where you're seeing kind of the shifts.

Quite frankly, we took our field people out of their company cars. We made a onetime payment to do that. And we expensed that in the quarter. And also, I'll be honest with you, we -- some of the operating costs are up more than we would expect on a long-term basis because we're make some investments in our front line.

So our debt level, roughly $2.9 billion, is where we have targeted to be, not that we wouldn't raise it for something that necessitated us to do that. It would not be for share repurchases. We're buying our shares out of our free cash flow, which has been, as I said in my remarks, pretty healthy and a pretty healthy increase over prior year. And I don't know, that's pretty much it. I mean, we've stayed at this level for a little bit. We did raise a little more money. Again, the last year, I referenced that; we took advantage of the yield curve at the time and did an incremental of $250 million at 30 year, about 4.5%. And in essence, that's going into share repurchase this year. If you look at our $650 million to $700 million, it's roughly $250 million higher than our sort of $400 million to $450 million average per year amount. That's simply reflecting that incremental $250 million bar, but there's no other plan to significantly change our capital structure."

But there are a lot of things we're doing in marketing that comes specifically from our marketing return on investment work, which is yielding improved effectiveness on that same level of marketing spend, that 7.5% of sales. One of the reasons we don't feel we need to do more is because we're getting good results. Moving our TV spots from 30 seconds to 15 seconds, depending upon the campaign. All sorts of shifts around -- between, I'll call them, prime channels and cable channels, programmatic through digital display. I mean, there's lots of things that we're doing that we're learning and learning from our ROI. Reducing in certain markets traditional out-of-home, billboards, local radio. There are places where they're effective, but we've discovered lots of places where they are not, and we spend a lot of time working with our marketing folks to analyze this data and shift our monies where we get the best return. And it's very consistent with RCI. We -- that's an area we want to find the waste, and we want to redeploy it. And slowly but surely, we think we're getting there."

Once again, we posted another solid quarter as our teams continued to relentlessly focus against our strategy. We're on track with driving integrated communications and execution across our priority brands and RCI continues to permeate throughout the organization and drive sustainable financial benefits.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 1% on almost 4 points of positive mix and price. Volumes grew across our portfolio, with CSDs increasing by 1% and noncarbs increasing by 2%. Brand Dr Pepper decreased 1% in the quarter as continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business was more than offset by declines in diet. Our Diet Dr Pepper business continues to significantly outperform the diet category, declining at about half the rate of all diets, driven by the strength of our Lil' Sweet campaign.
Our Core 4 brands also declined 1%, as over 5% growth in Canada Dry was more than offset by declines in 7UP, A&W and Sunkist Soda. Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9% respectively, on increased activation at a large retailer. Squirt grew 8% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. and Peñafiel grew 4%. All other CSD brands decreased 2% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple declined 2% as growth from product innovation was more than offset by the effect a year ago of liquidating certain Snapple inventories. As a reminder, Snapple growth in the second quarter last year was 11%. Hawaiian Punch decreased 5%, as expected, driven primarily by price increases on single-serve packages. Mott's was flat in the quarter, as growth in sauce was fully offset by decreases in juice, driven by price increases on single-serve packages. Clamato grew 14% in the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.
Our water category grew 25% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. All other noncarb brands decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of a Country Time business.
Building our brands continue to be a critical element of our overall strategy and success, and we've got another strong calendar programming that is targeted against our consumer insights for the back half of the year. Our regular Dr Pepper 20 ounce program highlights 150 unique labels that allow consumers to choose their favorite bottle that represents their individuality. Though it's early on, we're seeing recent upward trends in our convenient and gas business, and our consumers are showcasing their love for the bottles on social platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter. You can also even purchase your preferred bottle on eBay.
As I mentioned earlier, our diet Lil' Sweet campaign continues to drive impressive results for the brand and we'll start college football off strong with heavy media across TV and digital platforms and activation in large national accounts. And new this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country to bring Dr Pepper to every football gathering in his own Dr Pepper van. Our Dr Pepper Cherry push is bringing new users into the franchise and consumers are enjoying A&W root beer floats at their summer parties. Core 4 is bringing back monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device.
Canada Dry will continue to capitalize on growth in the ale category, with increased media throughout the rest of the year and will activate against Schweppes sparkling waters, honing in on the growing mixture occasion. Snapple will remind consumers to make time for Snapple, with quirky new Real Facts ads and we'll once again bring news to the TO with red, blue election-themed LTOs.
Clamato has partnered with an authentic Mexican beer to spice up outdoor gatherings as the original Michelada. You may have seen our Mott's Secret Life of Pets packaging in the market. And just in time for back-to-school, Mott's will support schools with bonus Box Tops for Education.
As you've seen, we've got a tremendous amount of activity lined up that engages our consumers and gives our customers and partners programs to rally behind.
Now let me turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
9247431,372093665,1014706,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin wa",1613,"Thanks, Larry. Let me start with a high level financial summary of the quarter, which, as Larry just said, reflected solid performance.
Sales volume increased 1%, with reported net sales up 2%. Core operating income was up 6% and core operating margin was 22.8%, up 70 basis points. Core EPS was up 11% in the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 8% and core EPS was up 12%.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increased 2% on about 2.5 points of favorable product and package mix, just over 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was just over 1.5 points of foreign currency translation and almost 1 point of unfavorable segment mix, as concentrate sales were relatively higher this year.
Reported gross margins increased 120 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 59.3% last year to 60.5% this year, of which 90 basis points was driven by the favorable effect of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes. Lower commodity costs, primarily PET and aluminum, increased gross margins by 60 basis points, and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other packaging and ingredient cost reductions, increased gross margins by another 50 basis points. The impact of positive net pricing also increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
The effect of mix, mostly from products purchased from others, reduced gross margins by 100 basis points. And finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 30 basis points as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars and finished products sold in Canada are sourced from the U.S.
For the quarter, SG&A, excluding depreciation, increased by $4 million on inflationary and certain other increases and operating expenses, including a onetime $4 million cost associated with the transition of a certain employee benefit program. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation, a reduction in transportation costs, driven by lower fuel prices and $7 million of lower marketing investments year-over-year due to timing shifts of brand campaigns. Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million in the quarter.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $5 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Other income increased by $23 million in the quarter as a result of a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability. This gain has been excluded from our core results. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.3% compared to 35.5% last year.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $407 million, net of the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Cash from operating activities was up $58 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of certain working capital amounts and the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital spending was $68 million compared to $42 million last year as we have spent incrementally to further support our growth in Mexico. Our new mineral water plant north of Mexico City should be operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
For the first 6 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $493 million, with $303 million in shares repurchased and $190 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on Rapid Continuous Improvement. Our 2016 lean tracks are in full swing. We've already had over 75 Kaizen events across the organization, and we're seeing wins across the board. I'll share a few now. 
In our Orlando DSD site, driver turnover has been reduced by 44%, driven by improved recruiting, on-boarding and performance management processes. Through this lean track nationally, we're also learning from our drivers other elements of waste that will enable us to further improve the effectiveness of our route delivery system. A job role safety playbook, developed by our frontline employees, is driving a 25% recordable injury reduction year-over-year in the second quarter, helping drive 12 months trend rates down almost double digits. We've closed over 2,000 voids on Dr Pepper's smaller CSD packages in a large retailer through a similar process we used to close voids on other brands. And certain allied brands are experiencing both double and triple-digit growth rates, partially as a result of our tracks specifically focused on allied brand distribution and availability. And as I've mentioned before, we have a tremendous amount of RCI activity going on throughout the business in addition to our lean tracks. Branch managers in our central business units gained 10 hours per week of additional customer-facing time by adopting the RCI principle of standard work. And our Mexican team has improved Peñafiel distribution with our third-party distributors by creating standard work for trade management and point-of-sale.
We have great urgency to improve the performance of brand 7UP. Our lean track is under way. And while there is still a great deal of work to do, the team has diligently focused on the components of brand messaging and execution in local markets. Supporting this is a deep inspection of pricing, packaging, channel and geographic competitive trends alongside those of 7UP. These insights should enable us to begin implementing certain changes in the balance of 2016. There is definitely more to come on 7UP. Again, these are just very few examples of the vast improvement initiatives taking place across our entire business everyday.
Now let me move on to 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our first half performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the $4.27 to $4.35 range. This is inclusive of what we now expect to be about a 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined versus the 2.5% that we had expected previously. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat. Similar to our previous guidance, we expect CSDs to be about flat, while we expect noncarbs to be up slightly. Remember that our noncarb volume performance is being tempered this year by pricing actions taken across several of our Warehouse Direct brands. However, we still expect continued growth from other noncarb brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
On a total company basis, we expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%. Our January 1 concentrate price increase will drive about 40 basis points of this increase and price increases on our Warehouse Direct brands will drive an additional 20 basis points. The remainder will come from mix as a result of stronger growth from smaller CSD packages and brands, such as Snapple, Clamato and our allied brand portfolio.
Moving on to cost of goods. Given our hedge positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we now expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis. This expectation still reflects deflation in commodities such as PET and aluminum and, as we have previously said, a headwind on corn, driven primarily by increases in toll-linked fees and unfavorable pricing of corn co-products, from which we derive our net corn price. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction, as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above should result in roughly similar gross margins in 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $15 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the original $20 million that we had previously expected. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we're also now expecting favorability from lower fuel costs of about $10 million, more than half of which we have already experienced. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the year. This implies a significant uptick in the back half of the year, mostly in the third quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit. Our net interest expense will be around 4.5% on our $2.9 billion of debt, which implies an increase of approximately $15 million, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 35.5%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, even with the spending for our new plant in Mexico.
We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
Now let me highlight a couple of additional phasing items that will help you update your models. First, as previously mentioned, while we expect commodities to be deflationary for the full year, the deflation has already been experienced and our trends are expected to turn flat to slightly up for the balance of the year due to the year-over-year timing of a certain commodity-related rebate. And second, based on timing of prior year true-ups, both the third quarter and fourth quarter will experience an increase in health and welfare and other insurance costs.
With that said, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

But most of the retailers and most of our customers want them in a block. They keep them in the same area. And so we'll have to watch it, but we're not that concerned with it.

I will also tell you, just want to remind you that we said in our prepared remarks and on the press release, don't forget Packaged Beverages took a $4 million nonrecurring hit. Quite frankly, we took our field people out of their company cars. We made a onetime payment to do that. And we expensed that in the quarter. And also, I'll be honest with you, we -- some of the operating costs are up more than we would expect on a long-term basis because we're make some investments in our front line. Lots of activities going on. It's no secret. Everybody's sort of worried about their front line people, and we're taking care of our front line people and we're spending a little more money to do that.

So the colas have had -- they had declined for quite some time, and I think it's more of a cola than what we're seeing in the flavors. The flavors continue to the strong, and that's why we look at them positive and say that we think that we can keep CSDs basically flat to maybe up a little bit."

Our third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives.

Our third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority, trademark brands. And it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2%, on 3-points of positive mix in price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter, as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business, as well as growth in our bottled can business. Regular Dr Pepper continue to perform well and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 10% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP and we are encouraged by the results of this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9% respectively, and Squirt grew 7% in strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel, grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our AIDS line. All of the CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago, Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter, on decreased promotional activity and singleserve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well as category headwind is driving declines in dues more than offset growth from our sauce business. Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth on our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI, and continued growth in Aguafiel.
We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico, rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand. All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand, which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased margin investment of third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season and once again Dr Pepper is front and center. We got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country and his own Dr Pepper brand, to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a view being listed on eBay for $75 apiece. And then in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by feeding the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be both on TV and digital platforms during the holiday season supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mix occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with tea season, our red and blue fruit election themed LTO.
I thank you can see our marketing calendar in this year very strong. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5% and",1174,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5% and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter and it was up 9% on a currency neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increased included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, one percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margin increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment on our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit, marketing as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter, and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. Reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multi-employer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million, with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You heard me mention many times that we not only utilized the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity, but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackled several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales can recently refind the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regards to our allied brand portfolio, an SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focus on improving processes effecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turn over year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP, and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: Safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now, moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredient to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs, versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases. And we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing. Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35% and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico.
We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

So I would say, this question goes to directly one of the things we talked about, in terms of risk in our allied brand portfolio is, what happens when if one of these brands sold new brands, I think, we're really comfortable with the strategy itself, and the ability of through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer, to innovate quickly, and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital, it does require work to execute. You know clearly, we've always said that it's not about if it's more about when the success will want to decide do something with a company, these are all startups, these are all entrepreneurial red businesses, and you know our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way and you may mentioned there is something just now, always been around a while, know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think will all characterize having been done at very large multiple. Everyone conformed their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands whether or not made hindsight those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. You know that -- those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are going to be creative, to innovate and we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them and a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide, they want to do with the companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think what's fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of growth can be sustained over a long enough period of time, obviously carries risks. Whether or not brand that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challenge able. And so we're mindful of this and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories when others see somebody being successful, you draw a competition and we know we've seen exposures in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example, what I did today versus what it was painfully the category still growing strongly. So we think about these things carefully.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority, trademark brands, and it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships, and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business as well as growth in our bottled can business. Regular Dr Pepper continued to perform well, and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 7% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP, and we are encouraged by the results this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and Squirt grew 7% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our age lime. All other CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago. Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter on decreased promotional activity and single-serve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well as category headwinds driving declines in juice more than offset growth from our sauce business.
Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand.
All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased marquee investment in the third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season, and once again, Dr Pepper is front and center. We've got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country in his own Dr Pepper brand to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year, and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a few being listed on eBay for $75 a piece. And in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by feeding the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be on both on TV and digital platforms during the holiday season, supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mixer occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with TEAcision, our Red and Blue Fruit election-themed LTO. I think you can see our marketing calendar ends this year very strong.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and",1173,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter, and it was up 9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. Reported net sales increase included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment on our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions, increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit. Marketing, as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain other inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step-acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. Reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You've heard me mention many times that we not only utilized the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackled several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization, and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales team recently refined the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regard to our allied brand portfolio. An SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focused on improving processes affecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turn over year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: Safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing.
Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

I'll make some comments, and Larry can add anything if he wants. So obviously, this question goes to directly one of the things we've talked about in terms of risk on our allied brand portfolio is what happens when and if one of these brand owners decide to sell their brand. I think we're really comfortable with the strategy itself and the ability of us through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer to innovate quickly and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital. It does require work to execute. You know clearly, we've always said that it's not about if it's more about when the successful ones decide and want to do something with their companies. These are all start-ups. These are all entrepreneurial great businesses. And you know our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way. And you mentioned, Dara, something just now, don't sit around awhile, know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think we would all characterize having been done at very large multiples. Everyone conformed their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands whether or not made hindsight those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. You know that -- those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are going to be creative, to innovate, and we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them. And a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide they want to do with their companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think, look, fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of early growth could be sustained over a long enough period of time obviously carries risks. Whether or not brands that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challengeable. And so we're mindful of this, and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories. When others see somebody being successful, you draw a competition, and we know we've seen explosions in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example. Look where that is today versus where it was. Thankfully, the category still growing strongly. So we think about all these things carefully. We will never say never, but we're going to be careful and cautious."

It doesn't mean they can't own brands and license brands out through their bottling system. I think they come to us is simply because I think they know we're sort of open in that sense. We're saying out loud, look, our distribution system is an asset. We're willing to leverage it under the right circumstances with the right partners, recognizing that there could always be the risk that we talked about earlier on this call.

We were challenging that traditional thinking. You know page search, all that stuff again that happens on social media, how we think about Twitter versus Facebook, I think and Instagram and other vehicles again. So there's -- finally coupons.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority trademark brands, and it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships, and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business as well as growth in our bottle-can business. Regular Dr Pepper continued to perform well, and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 7% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP, and we are encouraged by the results this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and Squirt grew 7% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our aged lime [ph]. All other CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago. Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter on decreased promotional activity and single-serve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well, as category headwinds driving declines in juice more than offset growth from our sauce business.
Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand.
All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased marketing investment in the third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season, and once again, Dr Pepper is front and center. We've got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country in his own Dr Pepper van to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year, and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a few being listed on eBay for $75 apiece. And in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by seating the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be on both TV and digital platforms during the holiday season, supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mixer occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with TEAcision, our Red and Blue Fruit election-themed LTO. I think you can see our marketing calendar ends this year very strong.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and",1174,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter, and it was up 9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. The reported net sales increase included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment in our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions, increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit. Marketing, as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain other inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step-acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. The reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You've heard me mention many times that we not only utilize the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackle several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization, and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales team recently refined the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regard to our allied brand portfolio. A SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focused on improving processes affecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turnover year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing.
Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

I'll make some comments, and Larry can add any if he wants. So obviously, this question goes to directly one of the things we've talked about in terms of risk in our allied brand portfolio, is what happens when and if one of these brand owners decides to sell their brand. I think we're really comfortable with the strategy itself and the ability of us through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer to innovate quickly and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital. It does require work to execute. Clearly, we've always said that it's not about ""if."" It's more about when the successful ones decide they want to do something with their companies. These are all start-ups. These are entrepreneurial-bred businesses. And our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way. And you made mention, Dara, of something just now. Those who have been around awhile know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think we would all characterize having been done at very large multiples. Everyone can form their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands, whether or not, with hindsight, those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. Those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are doing: to be creative, to innovate. And we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them. And a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide they want to do with their companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think, look, fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of early growth could be sustained over a long enough period of time obviously, carries risk. Whether or not brands that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challengeable. And so we're mindful of this, and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories. When others see somebody being successful, you draw competition. And we know we've seen explosions in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example. Look where that is today versus where it was. Thankfully, the category is still growing strongly. So we think about all these things carefully. We will never say never, but we're going to be careful and cautious."

And then the second question is I was hoping you could just give us an update on the pricing environment for what you're seeing in the marketplace from a promotional and list pricing standpoint.

It doesn't mean they can't own brands and license brands out through their bottling system. I think they come to us just simply because I think they know we're sort of open in that sense. We're saying out loud, look, our distribution system is an asset. We're willing to leverage it under the right circumstances with the right partners, recognizing that there could always be the risk that we talked about earlier on this call.

So there's -- finally coupons. I keep forgetting the traditional on-pack coupons, a real challenge there as to whether that actually gives you any incrementality whatsoever or not.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority trademark brands, and it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships, and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business as well as growth in our bottle-can business. Regular Dr Pepper continued to perform well, and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 7% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP, and we are encouraged by the results this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and Squirt grew 7% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our aged lime [ph]. All other CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago. Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter on decreased promotional activity and single-serve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well, as category headwinds driving declines in juice more than offset growth from our sauce business.
Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand.
All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased marketing investment in the third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season, and once again, Dr Pepper is front and center. We've got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country in his own Dr Pepper van to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year, and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a few being listed on eBay for $75 apiece. And in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by seating the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be on both TV and digital platforms during the holiday season, supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mixer occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with TEAcision, our Red and Blue Fruit election-themed LTO. I think you can see our marketing calendar ends this year very strong.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and",1174,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter, and it was up 9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. The reported net sales increase included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment in our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions, increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit. Marketing, as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain other inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step-acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. The reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You've heard me mention many times that we not only utilize the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackle several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization, and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales team recently refined the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regard to our allied brand portfolio. A SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focused on improving processes affecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turnover year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing.
Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

I'll make some comments, and Larry can add any if he wants. So obviously, this question goes to directly one of the things we've talked about in terms of risk in our allied brand portfolio, is what happens when and if one of these brand owners decides to sell their brand. I think we're really comfortable with the strategy itself and the ability of us through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer to innovate quickly and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital. It does require work to execute. Clearly, we've always said that it's not about ""if."" It's more about when the successful ones decide they want to do something with their companies. These are all start-ups. These are entrepreneurial-bred businesses. And our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way. And you made mention, Dara, of something just now. Those who have been around awhile know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think we would all characterize having been done at very large multiples. Everyone can form their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands, whether or not, with hindsight, those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. Those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are doing: to be creative, to innovate. And we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them. And a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide they want to do with their companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think, look, fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of early growth could be sustained over a long enough period of time obviously, carries risk. Whether or not brands that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challengeable. And so we're mindful of this, and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories. When others see somebody being successful, you draw competition. And we know we've seen explosions in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example. Look where that is today versus where it was. Thankfully, the category is still growing strongly. So we think about all these things carefully. We will never say never, but we're going to be careful and cautious."

And  look, I'll tell you the pipeline is pretty full.

It doesn't mean they can't own brands and license brands out through their bottling system. I think they come to us just simply because I think they know we're sort of open in that sense. We're saying out loud, look, our distribution system is an asset. We're willing to leverage it under the right circumstances with the right partners, recognizing that there could always be the risk that we talked about earlier on this call.

So there's -- finally coupons. I keep forgetting the traditional on-pack coupons, a real challenge there as to whether that actually gives you any incrementality whatsoever or not.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority trademark brands, and it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships, and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business as well as growth in our bottled can business. Regular Dr Pepper continued to perform well, and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 7% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP, and we are encouraged by the results this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and Squirt grew 7% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our age line. All other CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago. Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter on decreased promotional activity and single-serve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well, as category headwinds driving declines in juice more than offset growth from our sauce business.
Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand.
All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased marketing investment in the third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season, and once again, Dr Pepper is front and center. We've got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country in his own Dr Pepper van to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year, and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a few being listed on eBay for $75 apiece. And in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by seeding the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be on both TV and digital platforms during the holiday season, supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mixer occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with TEAcision, our Red and Blue Fruit election-themed LTO. I think you can see our marketing calendar ends this year very strong.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and",1174,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter, and it was up 9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. The reported net sales increase included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment in our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions, increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit. Marketing, as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain other inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step-acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. The reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You've heard me mention many times that we not only utilize the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackle several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization, and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales team recently refined the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regard to our allied brand portfolio. An SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focused on improving processes affecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turnover year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing.
Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

I'll make some comments, and Larry can add any if he wants. So obviously, this question goes to directly one of the things we've talked about in terms of risk in our allied brand portfolio is what happens when and if one of these brand owners decides to sell their brand. I think we're really comfortable with the strategy itself and the ability of us through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer to innovate quickly and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital. It does require work to execute. Clearly, we've always said that it's not about if. It's more about when the successful ones decide they want to do something with their companies. These are all start-ups. These are entrepreneurial-bred businesses. And our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way. And you made mention, Dara, of something just now. Those who have been around awhile know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think we would all characterize having been done at very large multiples. Everyone can form their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands, whether or not, with hindsight, those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. Those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are doing: to be creative, to innovate. And we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them. And a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide they want to do with their companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think, look, fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of early growth could be sustained over a long enough period of time obviously carries risk. Whether or not brands that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challengeable. And so we're mindful of this, and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories. When others see somebody being successful, you draw competition. And we know we've seen explosions in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example. Look where that is today versus where it was. Thankfully, the category is still growing strongly. So we think about all these things carefully. We will never say never, but we're going to be careful and cautious."

It doesn't mean they can't own brands and license brands out through their bottling system. I think they come to us just simply because I think they know we're sort of open in that sense. We're saying out loud, look, our distribution system is an asset. We're willing to leverage it under the right circumstances with the right partners, recognizing that there could always be the risk that we talked about earlier on this call.

There's a lot of shifting happening across the media vehicles. A lot of things that we're learning about digital and social, which have very high returns. I think in the past, we've commented also about maybe we shouldn't do as much local radio in some cases or particularly out of home, which is billboards, for example, which have been traditional but now are being challenged by that -- we were challenging that traditional thinking: page search, all that stuff again that happens on social media, how we think about Twitter versus Facebook, I think, and Instagram and other vehicles again. So there's -- finally coupons. I keep forgetting the traditional on-pack coupons, a real challenge there as to whether that actually gives you any incrementality whatsoever or not.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress in our strategic initiatives. We stayed focused against our strategy of driving integrated communication and execution across our priority trademark brands, and it is driving good results. We continue to expense growth in the quarter from our allied brand partnerships, and we continue to build our culture of continuous improvement with meaningful results.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 2% on 3 points of positive mix and price. CSD volumes increased by 2% and noncarbs were flat. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter as we experienced continued strong growth in our fountain foodservice business as well as growth in our bottle can business. Regular Dr Pepper continued to perform well, and Diet Dr Pepper continued to significantly outperform the diet category, growing by almost 1% in the quarter.
Our Core 4 brands increased 2%, as 7% growth in Canada Dry and 1% growth in Sunkist were partially offset by a 2% decline in A&W and a 1% decline in 7UP. Many of you know that we have had a lean track solely focus on 7UP, and we are encouraged by the results this past quarter.
Crush and Schweppes grew 4% and 9%, respectively, and Squirt grew 7% on strong growth in both Mexico and the U.S. Peñafiel grew 1% in the face of increased competition, particularly against our age line. All other CSDs decreased 3% in the quarter.
In noncarbs, Snapple was flat, cycling 5% growth a year ago. Hawaiian Punch decreased 6% in the quarter on decreased promotional activity and single-serve price increases. And Mott's declined 6% as well, as category headwinds driving declines in juice more than offset growth from our sauce business.
Clamato grew 5% in the quarter, and our water category grew 16% on growth in our allied brand portfolio, particularly Bai and FIJI and continued growth in Aguafiel. We chose to acquire our Aguafiel partnership interest in Mexico rather than liquidate the venture because we believe that on our own, we can further improve the performance of the brand.
All other noncarb brands decreased 9% in the quarter, almost entirely due to our exit of the Country Time business. This decline was partially offset by strong growth in BODYARMOR, another allied brand which is continuing to grow share in the sports drink category.
Unlocking growth in our priority brands through strong communication continues to be critical to driving our business results. Our marketing calendar for the balance of the year and the increased marketing investment in the third quarter reflects just that. We're in the heart of college football season, and once again, Dr Pepper is front and center. We've got heavy media across both TV and several digital platforms and increased activation at retail year-over-year.
New this year, Larry Culpepper will be tailgating across the country in his own Dr Pepper van to bring the brand to countless football gatherings. In fact, Larry has become such a popular icon to the brand that we began selling Larry Culpepper Halloween costumes this year, and to no surprise, they were sold out in a matter of weeks. We've even spotted a few being listed on eBay for $75 apiece. And in just 2 days, we'll be taking over student sections by seeding the Larry costumes across a multitude of college campuses during the games.
Also new this year, 7UP and Canada Dry will be on both TV and digital platforms during the holiday season, supporting our green bottle program. And Core 4 is bringing back Monster-themed mini cans for Halloween with an app that will bring the monsters to life on your smart device. We'll continue to drive retail activation against Schweppes sparkling waters honing in on the mixer occasion for the holidays. And Snapple is reminding consumers to take a break from the election with TEAcision, our Red and Blue Fruit election-themed LTO. I think you can see our marketing calendar ends this year very strong.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through our financial results and our updated guidance."

Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and",1174,"Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a high-level financial summary for the quarter. Sales volume increased 1% with reported net sales up 3%. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales were up 4%. Core operating income was up 5%, and core operating margin was 21.7%, up 40 basis points. Core EPS was up 8% in the quarter, and it was up 9% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now let me provide some further details. The reported net sales increase included 2 points of favorable product and package mix, 1 percentage point of price realization and a 1% increase in sales volumes. Reducing this net sales growth was 1 point of foreign currency translation.
Reported gross margins increased 60 basis points in the quarter, increasing from 58.7% last year to 59.3% this year. 70 basis points of this improvement was driven by the favorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market commodity price changes. Positive net pricing, including a favorable trade spend adjustment in our Packaged Beverages segment, increased gross margins by 50 basis points.
Lower commodity costs and continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI as well as certain other input cost reductions, increased gross margins by 30 basis points each. The impact of mix, mostly from our allied brands, as expected, reduced gross margins by 80 basis points. And inflationary increases in certain other manufacturing costs and increased depreciation decreased gross margins by 30 basis points.
Finally, foreign currency reduced gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points, principally as Mexico sources certain inputs in U.S. dollars.
For the quarter, reported SG&A, excluding depreciation, rose by $11 million after a $6 million foreign currency translation benefit. Marketing, as planned, increased $15 million, reflecting new priority brand creatives across several of our trademarks. While we did experience certain other inflationary cost increases, these were mostly offset by lower transportation costs driven by lower fuel prices.
Depreciation and amortization declined $2 million. Other income increased by $5 million as a result of a noncash gain on the step-acquisition accounting of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico. We chose to acquire our partner's interest for $15 million, funded with cash in the joint venture.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting an overall higher debt balance and higher rates from our fourth quarter 2015 refinancing. Our reported effective tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter and includes a $17 million gain associated with a legal entity restructuring. The reported effective tax rate in the prior year was 34.4%.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was $683 million, down $40 million compared to last year, primarily due to the $35 million payment of the multiemployer pension plan liability. Capital spending was $110 million compared to $71 million last year. For the first 9 months, total distributions to our shareholders were $748 million with $460 million in shares repurchased and $288 million in dividends paid.
Before I move on to guidance, let me give a quick update on RCI. You've heard me mention many times that we not only utilize the tools and principles of RCI to drive productivity but also to drive top line growth. Our 2016 lean tracks reflect the balance of the 2 and tackle several of our largest identified opportunities across the organization, and to date, we're seeing strong successes. For example, our web sales team recently refined the void reporting process and closed 98% of their execution voids across regular Dr Pepper smaller CSD packages.
With regard to our allied brand portfolio. An SKU prioritization lean activity resulted in distribution and availability growth on priority SKUs by 42%. Our lean track focused on improving processes affecting our route delivery drivers drove a 17% reduction in turnover year-on-year during the summer selling season. And our lost time injuries are down 32% year-on-year, showing a significant improvement in the most severe injuries as a result of our relentless focus on safety and development of our safety playbooks.
And as I mentioned last quarter, we've been very focused on improving the performance of 7UP and have a separate lean track dedicated to the brand. While we are not declaring success and still have a great deal of work to do on the brand, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement in trends. As you can see, we continue to engage our people across all 5 pillars of RCI: safety, quality, delivery, productivity and growth.
Now moving to our updated 2016 guidance. We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2%, inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%. Given our year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year core EPS guidance. We now expect core EPS to be in the range of $4.32 to $4.40. This is still inclusive of an expected 3% headwind from both foreign currency translation and transaction combined. We continue to expect total company sales volume to be about flat, with CSDs about flat and noncarbs up slightly. We also continue to expect combined price and mix to be up about 3%.
Moving on to cost of goods. We continue to expect packaging and ingredients to be about 1% deflationary on a constant volume/mix basis, which has already been realized. For modeling purposes, remember that growth from some of our noncarb portfolio and allied brands will also increase the dollar value of cost of goods. And also remember that cost of goods is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction as I mentioned a moment ago. Collectively, all the factors I just mentioned should result in roughly similar gross margins for all of 2016.
Moving to SG&A. We now expect an increase of approximately $5 million in health and welfare and other insurance costs versus the $15 million that we had previously expected, and we have already experienced this increase. We also still expect general inflation in our field labor costs to increase operating expenses by approximately $20 million for the year. We also continue to invest in execution across our business and are forecasting additional investment of about $3 million in our frontline employees in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we will be able to achieve productivity benefits from RCI that will help offset a portion of these increases, and we continue to expect favorability from lower fuel costs. We continue to expect marketing to be about 7.5% of sales for the full year, which implies an increase in the fourth quarter.
Now moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense will be approximately $12 million higher, driven primarily by our fourth quarter 2015 debt refinancing.
Our full year core tax rate is now expected to be approximately 35%, and we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales, including the spending for our new plant in Mexico. We also continue to expect to repurchase approximately $650 million to $700 million of our common stock in 2016, subject to market conditions.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Larry."

I'll make some comments, and Larry can add any if he wants. So obviously, this question goes to directly one of the things we've talked about in terms of risk in our allied brand portfolio is what happens when and if one of these brand owners decides to sell their brand. I think we're really comfortable with the strategy itself and the ability of us through allied brand partners to move quickly with the consumer to innovate quickly and to do it in a way, at least at the front end that requires little hard capital. It does require work to execute. Clearly, we've always said that it's not about if. It's more about when the successful ones decide they want to do something with their companies. These are all start-ups. These are entrepreneurial-bred businesses. And our view is whatever we do, whatever we should do is going to be done in a disciplined way. And you made mention, Dara, of something just now. Those who have been around awhile know that there are a handful of precedent transactions in this industry that I think we would all characterize having been done at very large multiples. Everyone can form their own conclusion. I think you know some of those brands, whether or not, with hindsight, those ended up being successful or not. But we want to be very disciplined. Those precedent transactions clearly drive many entrepreneurs to do exactly what they are doing: to be creative, to innovate. And we like that, and we're partnered with a number of them. And a number of these brands are showing some very early signs of success. Now we can't and are not in control of what these brand owners decide they want to do with their companies when they want to do it, how they want to do it. I think, look, fair to say as a major distributor of these brands, we would be aware if something were happening. But look, and we also understand that whether or not the very high levels of early growth could be sustained over a long enough period of time obviously carries risk. Whether or not brands that start in a certain category can actually be extendable early in their life to other categories is challengeable. And so we're mindful of this, and we never forget about competition. You've seen plenty of examples in different categories. When others see somebody being successful, you draw competition. And we know we've seen explosions in categories. You can look to sparkling water for example. Look where that is today versus where it was. Thankfully, the category is still growing strongly. So we think about all these things carefully. We will never say never, but we're going to be careful and cautious."

It doesn't mean they can't own brands and license brands out through their bottling system. I think they come to us just simply because I think they know we're sort of open in that sense. We're saying out loud, look, our distribution system is an asset. We're willing to leverage it under the right circumstances with the right partners, recognizing that there could always be the risk that we talked about earlier on this call.

There's a lot of shifting happening across the media vehicles. A lot of things that we're learning about digital and social, which have very high returns. I think in the past, we've commented also about maybe we shouldn't do as much local radio in some cases or particularly out of home, which is billboards, for example, which have been traditional but now are being challenged by that -- we were challenging that traditional thinking: page search, all that stuff again that happens on social media, how we think about Twitter versus Facebook, I think, and Instagram and other vehicles again. So there's -- finally coupons. I keep forgetting the traditional on-pack coupons, a real challenge there as to whether that actually gives you any incrementality whatsoever or not. And look, we just -- once a year we go through our 3 biggest portfolios of CSDs, teas and juice, and we try to incorporate and get better by incorporating the learnings. And we'll never stop."

Certainly, our brand performance, you could argue we have, for example, Diet Dr Pepper, well outperforming the diet category.
