We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments in some places where",2622,"Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking to you as we kick off 2016. We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments in some places where I feel like we need to continue to accelerate progress. I've spoken to you about this before and we're on a journey that is going to continue to take time both against our digital priorities as well as our product priorities. And so I want to spend a few minutes speaking to that and then I will focus a little bit on 2016 and where we are. 
So when I spoke to you a year ago and frankly, each quarter that we've had this conversation, I reiterated the fact that we have 3 core priorities in this company. The first one is product. And so we are at our core, a fashion apparel company and our customers come to us for great emotional, on trend, on brand products. And a lot of the work that we have been doing in 2015 is continuing to move our brands forward to get centered on their aesthetic, centered on the right trends, to restore the appropriate quality to our products and really put in place the products in our stores that we know that our customers love. And I'm really pleased with quality of the work and the quantity of the work and the pace of the work that we've been doing across the entire company against our product priorities. And I've spoken to you about my vision of how products is changing in this industry. It's fascinating as you look at how the fashion week activities have played out over the last couple of weeks. A lot of articles out there about how brands are now making product available on runway immediately to their consumers. We did that in a small way also in Banana Republic. To me, what that illustrates is the increasing clock speed inside of this business, how fast trend at the high end of the market down into the mass markets. And it's against that backdrop of increasing clock speed, increasing pace of this business that we've been making very significant changes in our product process, and I'm not going to go into all of those today, but those are changes focused on getting better and better each season at managing buying risk, as we build our assortments, and increasingly responsive and short supply chain, using science blended with the art of creativity, design and merchandising to build the best possible assortments for our brand and putting in place a very solid commercial planning process that allows us to make sure that we're building a commercial assortment that is on trend, on brand, with the right quality, mapped against delivering and exceeding our budget priorities. That is not all coming to fruition yet, but again, I'm pleased with the work that we're doing. 
There are a couple of key components there that I want to call out. I am true believer in quality, a big believer in quality and I believe that our customers are very sophisticated when it comes to understanding the value that we offer them in our products. And I'm extremely pleased with the quality restoration that I see in Gap's products and in Banana Republic. As we look at the spring assortment and the summer assortment going forward. 
Second issue as I've talked about responsiveness in our supply chain. This is a journey and again, I'm not going to tell you what yard line we're on or give you a numerical score, but we are making significant and rapid progress, progress that is reflected in platforming product where we're buying fabrics over multi-season buys, positioning that fabric with key strategic vendors, giving us responsive capabilities, in some cases, to leave open to buy in season so that we can be back into product in season. In essence, buying what's working rather than guessing what's going to work. 
The third thing is progress on inventory management. And a big step that we took forward was a couple of years ago where we brought all of our into inventory pools across our online and our stores together. We've made further progress this year where we've leveraged our retail DCs to provide direct fulfillment capacity for our online business, and we're continuing to take steps to make sure that we are stranding the least amount of inventory and getting every penny of gross margin out of all of our units across the entire business, regardless of what store it's in or what channel it was brought to fulfill. 
Second priority is experience. In our experience, I will call out a number of things we're doing, we're modernizing our POS. I've talked about that before. We've built a number of omni-channel capabilities. We've virtualized our inventory so that we have access to all of our inventory across all of our demand. The thing that I am really excited about is the accelerating pace of mobile and the mobile experience that we have. Historically, we've operated our websites in 2 separate platforms. We're in the process of bringing those together on a fully responsibly designed website. And most importantly, we're going through a cultural change inside the company of really thinking digital first and mobile first. Historically, in this business, the moment of truth was when a customer across the leased line into a story. Today, as a company, we are increasingly seeing the moment of truth is when a customer, through their phone, comes into our digital store and we either win or lose their affection, their engagement, and ultimately, their sales if we win or lose at that moment of truth. And that creates for us both an opportunity, but also an imperative to move as fast as the customer is moving in mobile. This year, the bulk of our traffic will be mobile traffic toward digital space. That represents an opportunity because a great majority of that traffic is incremental, but it also means that we offer the customer an emotional, immersive, holistic, engaging brand experience along with what we've historically done extremely well, which is a very efficient e-commerce transactional experience. 
The last priority is talent and the entire company sits on a foundation of talent. We've been able to attract and retain exceptional talent and I am committed to making sure that this company has the best talent in the industry lined up in our businesses and our functions. As you all know yet, I've not named a permanent head of our Old Navy brand. When you have a seat like that, SMT, which is one of the biggest seats in the business, I want to take my time to make sure that I understand looking forward what's the right profile of leadership for that seat and to understand our talent inside and outside the company in a way where I can make a decision that I feel is the best decision for the brand and the company. Part of what I spent my time on over the last few months is getting very deep into the Old Navy business and I'll speak more about that in a moment. To really understand where the growth opportunities, which are significant, where those growth opportunities inside of Old Navy and how do we map out leadership role against the pursuit of those growth opportunities. I know Old Navy pretty well. Several months ago, I've been much deeper with the team over there over the last few months then. And what I will honestly and directly say to you is as much as I was bullish about the opportunity in front of Old Navy before for a long-term continuous growth, I'm even that much more bullish today. I see a great brand and a compelling value proposition that I believe has the potential to hunt around the world and I'm super excited about the growth prospects in front of that business. 
So let's dive in a little bit more into each of the brands and just talk a little bit about my observations in 2015. So just to be clear, and I'll start with Old Navy since I was talking about Old Navy. 4 years of growth. That is a business that has demonstrated that the brand is strong and that the value proposition for masspirational passion, on trend, appropriate to the brand with great quality that she perceives and understands for the entire family, that's a compelling value proposition. 
We hit a bump in the road in Q4 and let me be clear about this. What happened in Q4, we have diagnosed and it was a combination of factors that unfortunately came together. First was we had a couple of style misses. We had a little bit of excess clearance inventory that we carried through. We had an unexpected drop of traffic, which is now, for the most part, corrected itself. The team is honest and they were making the right changes and I expect the Old Navy to get back on track and continue to deliver that kind of market share leading performance that we've seen now over the course of the last 4 years. 
Let me go to Banana for a moment. I knew it was going to be a rebuilding year from a product and aesthetic standpoint. We took Banana to a place where we were trying to lead on fashion and trend and she does not want Banana to be that. We've diagnosed it. We fixed it. I've seen the spring product. I've seen this summer product, but we got behind it in 2015 and I'm disappointed with the performance. But here is again why I'm confident about the Banana, which is we've been doing the right work. I feel we have a very strong team in place right now. We have centered on the classic, appropriate expected aesthetics of the brand and I feel much more comfortable that we were on track as we get into spring, summer and then fall this year. 
So moving quickly to Athleta. We delivered a very strong back half performance in Athleta. We have a business that is very well positioned for our customer. It is right in the sweet spot of lifestyle trend. It is fundamentally omni-channel and then it came from being a catalog and online business with now over 100 stores in the portfolio and I continue to be very bullish about the upside of that business and the growth potential. Just as a sidebar, I would point out that I've been very supportive in them continuing to look for incremental growth opportunities on top of that solid platform. And a few weeks ago, we announced that we are building out and assortment all the way from a very young girl of up to a teenager inside of the Athleta box. We're not putting incremental real estate behind that, rather we're putting it in our existing stores and where we feel that is a significant opportunity. So a great business one I'm super happy to have in our portfolio and I expect that you will continue to hear more news about Athleta going forward. 
Okay, last, let me finish as I talk about our brands with Gap brand. And I was kind of starting and ending with Gap brand when we started speaking a year ago. I knew we had a rebuilding year in front of us. It started with new leadership, a new team around that leadership. It worked to get the brand centered back on its casual optimistic American aesthetic and then rebalancing the assortment to assert our rightful share in key categories where Gap has always played. So the last couple of weeks I've been in stores. I'm always in stores at the beginning of a big seasonal flow with the cross functional team after our customers have had an opportunity to engage our products. 
First thing I would highlight is a renewed energy in our stores. It is partly a function of our field team, which is world-class. It is partly a function of the fact that we have product in the stores that lights the stores up. It's optimistic, it's colorful. It's feminine for the women. It's masculine for the men. It's got the right level of sophistication for Gap as a brand and it is much more centered in what the appropriate aesthetic is for the brand. So I see the aesthetic coming through very strong, casual optimistic American. 
Second thing I see across key categories, and it's complex that is fully developed to take advantage of share of wallet in knits. We have silhouettes and fabrication that cover a wide range of uses. We have color. We have print. We have pattern. We have neutrals. We have great quality in those knits and I see strong progress forward just by asserting our right to actually play as we should be playing in knits. 
Third, denim, core category of Gap. It's what the spring campaign has been focused on. Silhouettes, fabrications, wash and novelty, all right in the sweet spot of where denim trend is right now and I'm really optimistic about what I see coming in the denim business across all of our brands, but particularly in Gap brands. And so again, I could go on, and on about this. I could talk about our woven shirts programs. I could talk about outerwear development, but I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that the team has made against their diagnosis a year ago on what needed to happen and how the product now shows up in the stores in front of our customers. 
One of the things I want to reiterate and just make sure everybody hears it and I'll say this again every time we talk is I have strong conviction about the long-term growth prospects of this company and the work that we are doing to reestablish our dominance in key categories in our businesses to reassert appropriate aesthetic expression of our brands, the continued growth across all of our channels and the broad-based geographic growth that we put a structure in place to achieve. I am committed to that and we will continue to move down that path. Why I spend so much time talking about product? Because product is the foundation for gaining market share. And so I want to emphasize the fact that our commitment for growth is not just the commitment of building new stores in new geographies of taking new channels to new places. It's also about moving these brands back to a place where they can gain market share in our core markets. 
So 2015, a year of rebuilding, a year of focusing on getting our product back on track, reestablishing the past for a couple of our key brands. I'm confident that Old Navy will bump in the road and I'm confident in the value proposition and what that brand means to our consumers. What I can assure you as my team and I have a great deal of urgency. I know what this company is capable of at our best. I know what these brands are capable of at their best and I and my team are focused on, not just achieving that for a moment, but achieving that with the consistency. I'm looking forward to this coming year. I'm looking forward to seeing these brands start to perform to their potential, and I want to thank you for your support. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."

Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016. It's important to note that our reported results include pretax costs related to our previously announced strategi",1066,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016. It's important to note that our reported results include pretax costs related to our previously announced strategic action totaling $25 million for the quarter and $132 million for the year. That is at the low end of our guidance range of $130 million to $140 million. $98 million of the total full year charge is operating expense and the remainder hits gross margin. 
Now, starting with sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.4 billion. Comp sales were down 7%. For the full year, comp sales were down 4%. On a reported basis, 2015 net sales were $15.8 billion. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales would have totaled $16.2 billion, down 2%. 
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.4 billion and gross margin contracted 240 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margin was down 140 basis points as reported, but down only 80 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $5.7 billion and gross margin was down 210 basis points to 36.2%. Merchandise margin was down 130 basis points, as reported, but down only 60 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 80 basis points. 
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion. Marketing expenses totaled $169 million, $9 million below last year. For the full year, marketing expenses declined $61 million to $578 million. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion, about flat to last year. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.53 and full year EPS totaled $2.23. Excluding the impact of our strategic actions, adjusted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter and $2.43 for the year. Additionally, it's important to remember that FX negatively impacted full year EPS by an estimated $0.14 or about 5 percentage points of growth. 
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. On a net basis, we closed 5 stores in 2015 and our square footage remained about flat. This includes about 150 Gap specialty store closures, broadly in line with our guidance. So our count in square footage are listed in our press release. Capital expenditures totaled $726 million, which was below our guidance as we prudently reacted to the tougher business performance. Regarding balance sheet and cash flow. As a testament to the cash generating power of our business, in another wise difficult year, free cash flow totaled about $870 million. Consistent with our commitment to distributing excess cash, we paid $377 million in dividends and returned $1 billion through repurchases during the year. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash and our ending share count was $397 million shares. Inventory dollars per store were about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance and total inventory was down 1%. 
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2016. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 and operating margin to be about 9.5%. Embedded in our full year guidance is a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $120 million in EBIT, which equates to about $0.19 of EPS or 8 percentage points of EPS growth off of 2015's $2.43. 
Let me say more about foreign exchange given its significance. Our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan with combined sales in these 2 countries of about $2 billion. 2016 will be the fourth consecutive year with meaningful headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Note that our hedges help to delay, but not eliminate the impact of depreciating foreign currencies. To paint the picture of how dramatically currency movements have impacted our results in recent years, I'd like to offer a few metrics. The cumulative impact of weaker foreign currencies to our reported sales results was more than $700 million over the past 3 years. Absent these headwinds, 2015 net sales would have totaled $16.5 billion, up about $900 million since 2012. The impact to the bottom line is also meaningful. We estimate that the impact to EPS has been about $0.40 since 2012. 
Here are some additional 2016 guidance metrics. We expect to add 40 net new stores with square footage to remain about flat. In line with our strategy, openings will be focused on China outlet and Athleta while closures will continue to be weighted towards gap brand. We are reducing capital spending in 2016 to support improvement in return on invested capital. We expect capital expenditures to be about $650 million with a continued focus on mobile and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $560 million. Given our comp includes both store and online sales, we decided to guided to total inventory in 2016. We expect total inventory to be down in the low single-digits at the end of the first quarter. 
Regarding expenses, it's important to note that SG&A may deleverage against our 2015 reported levels as we potentially restore some categories of expense such as incentive based comp. And lastly, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%. 
Finally, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. As a reminder, our $400 million term loan matures in 2016. We currently intend to allocate a portion of our cash flow to repay this. Therefore, 2016 repurchases will likely be meaningfully lower than our historic average. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a challenging year for us and others in our sector. Despite our disappointing performance, it's important to highlight some of our strengths as we enter 2016. First, we believe that our size and portfolio of brands are a competitive advantage in areas such as sourcing, real estate and e-commerce. Second, as our track record has demonstrated, we of course plan to maintain our operating discipline. And finally, our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet allow us to make investments in areas like technology and supply chain needed to win in this evolving retail landscape over the long term. 
Thank you and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

In fact, Jack was there with me in the downtown Crossing stores shortly after it opened. We've been looking at it very carefully and the King of Pressure store as well and we have our eyes really on it. Probably the one thing I'll call out is, overall, 2 stores in a very large market haven't had a noticeable impact yet. And so if I look at our whole business, too early to call that at the end of the day, downtown Crossing specifically where you note that we do have the gap factory store business has remain strong and that store. Traffic is strong in that area. Of a grand opening effect Primark opening assortments are very early days, and we're watching it. My issue there always with the new competitor particularly on Primark. It does come in with very sharp price points with an everyday low pricing policy. Very intrigued to see how the American consumer response to that against the backdrop of how the whole sector typically prices, which is obviously more promotional pricing. So early days, watching it carefully."

So we've talked about the fact that over half of our expense base is related to our stores and over half of that is variable to sales. So when we have sales come down and as they did in the fourth quarter, we get some natural variability and expenses come down as well. I mentioned in my previous response as well as my prepared remarks that we obviously paid minimal bonus in 2015. So that was a portion in the fourth quarter as well as throughout the year, but probably especially in the fourth quarter of how we brought down the expenses and then finally, marketing as well. So that is actually the very reason why I'm signaling that there may be some deleverage in 2016 as we hopefully are meeting our goals for the year. That said, we're going to continue to manage our expenses very, very tightly so you can count on us from an absolute perspective to manage them quite tightly.

So to answer your question, am I comfortable with are behind us? No, is always going to have style business, obviously. Design's job is to push creatively and merchandising job is to counterbalance that with a commercial orientation. We all, across our brands and frankly, across the industry, one of the bigger style business of last year was tops went to a silhouette. It was a little bit shorter and a little boxier and many women voted that it wasn't very feminine. It wasn't very flattering and it was a style that was out there, but it was a style that frankly didn't really register with a lot of customers, and that's a good learning. I mean, the word femininity is one that continues to be one that I'm pushing to the front, whether it's across tops or bottoms. Probably a bigger issue. And then there was a little bit of an issue where we got a little bit over assorted. We got really enthusiastic about some sweater styles there's a positive certificate of toys that meant that she can end and she bought -- it was on or versus an end. And again, I'm confident that Sabrina and I have leaned in with the team, and we're worried about the business of look at how we brought it in.

So let me just highlight a bunch of things. And again, I'm not going to go through specific quantitative analysis here about several of the things that I feel very confident will register with our consumers as they start of fall back and assortments. So we just had a huge quality business. I mean, literally places where to whether it fit or quality of the fabrication, it made the product very difficult to where. I think I've said this before, but Blazers and Banana Republic assortment where it's really difficult for the average woman to actually get her arm into the armhole. So if you just take those out and you get back to common sense, quality that our customers expect, that is going to register with our customers. A second-place, places where we intentionally underdeveloped the product because of either we assumed it wasn't trending or it was the preference of an individual or whatever. An example of that is knits in women's knits in Gap brand where we underdeveloped last year. We left market share on the table. And this year, we have very intentional department across fabrications and silhouettes that we believe play in the relevant where categories and where locations for us. And that's another place where I call it reasserting development to get our fair share of market share. And I've been in the stores now and look at that and I encourage you to do that. You can see where we actually have a significant knits complex built out. Accessories would be the same. There is a spectacular [indiscernible] valley flat. I think it's in 10 colors that's now in the stores and we do business all day long with that. And it wasn't in the stores a year ago. And so those are places where, again, question, why we did it, but we've gone back in and said our fair share, we play here, this is where the brand plays. And then the last thing is the more complicated questions around our responsive capabilities. And so again, that is a journey right now, but we have in our 12 programs in spring as an example and I've talked about this before, the ability to be much faster in the product that is selling on our shelves through a combination of owning the fabric, having the fabric positioned approximate to vendors who have the capacity reserve to cut and saw into it. And ideally, those vendors, particularly for North America in the Caribbean basin, so that we can cut, saw, wash and die, put it on about and have it back in our stores very quickly. All of those things to me are kind of obvious that they will give us upside. So the only issue on my mind right now is will these things work an impact? It's just the pace and the timing. Sabrina noted in Gap brand that our traffic is been toughest there. Frankly, in my mind, because we've been off brand for longest there. So the pace and tightly with a customer comes back discovers the products that embraces it, tweets about it, post it on Instagram and Pinterest, that's really the unknown right now. But I'm very optimistic."

But at the moment, I'm not ready to call a number different than where we are as we look forward. The second thing I would really focused though and I've talked about this is I'm a strong believer in the fact that we can do more business and less real estate in the same location. And that is what we're focused on. Obviously, you can't flip the fleet overnight into smaller stores, but every opportunity we have, whether it's a lease coming up or reposition or an opportunity to gives an space back, intensify, we're going to be taking aggressive the advantage of those opportunities. And Gap's got the biggest opportunity there in my view. We tried a store in China. I was in that store a couple of weeks ago and I'm super pleased by what I saw. It's a very small store footprint with full expression of Gap brand and most importantly, it worked for the consumer. So the early days really thinking aggressively about densifying through fixtures, through holding versus folding versus hanging through how we use the cube of the store, with, all those kinds of things. I'm very encouraged by the opportunity there. But again, that's not an overnight flip."

But let's just basically talk about one of the things that cuts out many weeks, which is making a multi-season commitment to a fabric and then having that fabric repositioned to cut, wash, die and sawn into. That is most powerful is a capability and gotten fabrications. And so that applies to denim, to [indiscernible] , to knits, et cetera, really consistent across all the brands. If you start getting into the synthetics and then obviously well, wool, those types of things, it's less an issue there because he just can't necessarily platform this CapEx. Although you can some of them, not all of them. Importantly, you can also platform yarns for sweaters at the end of the day. So if I think about, the least relevant categories, probably accessories or outerwear. Most relevant would be our core cotton fabrications, which we have and are an important part of the business across all of our brands in denim, in, in knits, in, et cetera. We wouldn't be pushing something you're if it wasn't been April for the entire business. Importantly, it's also meaningful for Athleta where performance fabric as well.

And then with regard to March margins, Oliver, we don't explicitly guide to March margin only the operating margin, which I gave you. But to be helpful, there's sort of headwinds and tailwinds.

Also on the margin, I would say, although I wouldn't -- I don't want to make it any kind of big headline, but on the margin, there's certainly some average unit cost tailwind. So those are the 2 tailwinds. On the flip side, you have foreign exchange, which we've guided is actually growing in 2016. And remember, in 2015, it hurt our merchandise margins by 50 basis points and it's bound to be even bigger in 2016.

As the spring products has gotten into the stores, and I've been out in stores a lot. And I've been out in stores a lot on unannounced basis because I want to see what our customers are seeing versus what's been prepped for CEO visits. So I went into the, I'll just call one store out right now. Went into the store that we have, flagship store on 54th and fifth last week in New York. Product was fully expressed there for spring. We flipped that store. We brought women's down from the second floor down to the first and I walked in and I have to honestly say I'm not sure I've ever felt like that store showed up better as an expression of Gap brand. The color was evident, the femininity was clear. We have strong ownership and it's clear why we're in the business from the standpoint of women's bottoms, whether it's 12, denim or by stretch bottoms. The excess restatement was very powerful. And so I if I think about a front too of [ph] last year, neutral color palette, unfeminine silhouettes, some quality issues in our business, lots of overlapping that in development, et cetera, if you like, the firm to optimistic print pattern and color, feminine silhouettes, intentional denim development, ownership in the bottoms business, great accessories business. And so it's a big step in the right direction. The most important metric I look at, and I'm not going to go into the detail of this, is as we're obviously working our way through product from last year, clearance product, et cetera, I want to look at the new product that's current season's coat and understand how we bought it and then what kind of comp are running off of it in those are the most important early leading-edge indicator and so whether we're seeing good customer acceptance in the product so that's what of looking at right now. And then it'll eventually aggregate obviously were seeing good customer acceptance, were overselling our by plants that will aggregate the comp."

Athleta had, and I think we mentioned this and I'll just underline it, very strong back half and I was really pleased with that. The assortment was in line. They were on trend. The product was well bought and I was really pleased with the numbers. If you look at Old Navy, because you raised that specifically, we have had excellent performance out of the full family expression of activewear inside of Old Navy. We have been a little bit more promotional. So you're correct on that. But that does not signal anything other than we still have excellence performance out of that business, and we're seeing very strong growth. I'm really encouraged, frankly, across the whole company as I look at it right now because if you take Athleta, Old Navy's full family, active expression, add to it a young girl to tween expression inside of Athleta and then a full family expression inside of Gap, we are present and accounted for in the mainstream of what is probably the most important ready-to-wear trend that we've seen since skinny denim maybe came on the scene. So, if you like, we're very well represented there. We have great fabrics, were developments and as a company, we can share assets across the company, across fabric platforming and things like that. So it's a powerful place for us to be. If I specifically look at Athleta growth rates, and again, I've said this before. We are learning every day what the right mix of online catalog and stores is in the Athleta business. It's the opposite of what has happened in mainstream retail where people have gone online from a source business where in Athleta, we've gone into stores from an online and catalog business. And our initial expectation, as we start to open stores, was that it would probably be cannibalizing of our online business. And as we've learned and seen how the store channel and the direct channel interact with each other, we're really pleased to see that the direct business continues to grow even as we open stores and that as she discovers it in the store, she goes to direct, et cetera. So I can tell you I know what the right fleet size is right now. What I can tell you is that if I can grow this business in a highly accretive way without putting additional CapEx in the expenses of our operating stores into the ground and continue to see that growth happen to our existing stores in the online channel, that's a very attractive thing to do. So I'm just -- we're taking it slow and easy right now as we continue to explore the channel dynamics, but I am in no way signaling the fact that we have nothing, but anything, but very strong growth expectations out of that business."

Frankly, the reason we've gone there is that's where the customer is and we've got to go where the customer is right now. The whole outlet business has continued to morph over the last decade. It used to be a business that was highly physically isolated relative to the specialty business and obviously, there's been a collision going on where outlets get closer to specialty and the severance have spread out to work that outlet malls where built. And the online channel is another extension of that at the end of the day. That's where our customer is and we felt the need to have a presence there. It's early days right now. We're in our early days of having this channel.

And when we were closing and downsizing a lot of the unproductive square footage, we were able to leverage very easily, even on negative comps on some areas, but that is all behind us now. What is happening now is the international stores actually are a big headwind because as a percent of sales, they are a higher percent of sales. Now within their country every year, we are trying to get them to leverage, but from a mix perspective, they hurt the overall Rod profile. So where we sit today is it takes sort of a low single-digit comp to leverage Rod."

We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments in some places where",2628,"Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking to you as we kick off 2016. We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments in some places where I feel like we need to continue to accelerate progress. I've spoken to you about this before and we're on a journey that is going to continue to take time both against our digital priorities as well as our product priorities. And so I want to spend a few minutes speaking to that and then I will focus a little bit on 2016 and where we are.  
So when I spoke to you a year ago and frankly, each quarter that we've had this conversation, I've reiterated the fact that we have 3 core priorities in this company. The first one is product. And so we are at our core, a fashion apparel company and our customers come to us for great, emotional, on trend, on brand product. And a lot of the work that we have been doing in 2015 is continuing to move our brands forward to get centered on their aesthetic, centered on the right trends, to restore the appropriate quality to our products and to really put in place the products in our stores that we know that our customers love. And I'm really pleased with the quality of the work and the quantity of the work and the pace of the work that we've been doing across the entire company against our product priorities. 
And I've spoken to you about my vision of how products is changing in this industry. It's fascinating as you look at how the fashion week activities have played out over the last couple of weeks. A lot of articles out there about how brands are now making product available on runway immediately to their consumers. We did that in a small way also in Banana Republic. To me, what that illustrates is the increasing clock speed inside of this business, how fast trend at the high end of the market disseminates down into the mass market. And it's against that backdrop of increasing clock speed, increasing pace of this business that we've been making very significant changes in our product process. And I'm not going to go into all of those today, but those are changes focused on getting better and better each season at managing buying risk, as we build our assortments, and increasingly responsive and short supply chain, using science blended with the art of creativity, design and merchandising to build the best possible assortments for our brand and putting in place a very solid commercial planning process that allows us to make sure that we're building a commercial assortment that is on trend, on brand, with the right quality, mapped against delivering and exceeding our budget priorities. That is not all coming to fruition yet, but I'm, again, pleased with the work that we're doing. 
There are a couple of key components there that I want to call out. I am a true believer in quality, a big believer in quality and I believe that our customers are very sophisticated when it comes to understanding the value that we offer them in our products. And I'm extremely pleased with the quality restoration that I see in Gap's products and in Banana Republic. As we look at the spring assortment and the summer assortment going forward. 
Second issue as I've talked about responsiveness in our supply chain. This is a journey, and again, I'm not going to tell you what yard line we're on or give you a numerical score, but we are making significant and rapid progress, progress that is reflected in platforming product where we're buying fabrics over multi-season buys, positioning that fabric with key strategic vendors, giving us responsive capabilities, and in some cases, to leave open to buy in season so that we can be back into product in season. In essence, buying what's working rather than guessing what's going to work. 
The third thing is progress on inventory management. And a big step that we took forward was a couple of years ago where we brought all of our inventory pools across our online and our stores together. We've made further progress this year where we've leveraged our retail DCs to provide direct fulfillment capacity for our online business, and we're continuing to take steps to make sure that we are stranding the least amount of inventory and getting every penny of gross margin out of all of our units across the entire business, regardless of what store it's in or what channel it was brought to fulfill. 
Second priority is experience. In our experience, I will call out a number of things we're doing, we're modernizing our POS. I've talked about that before. We've built a number of omni-channel capabilities. We've virtualized our inventory so that we have access to all of our inventory across all of our demand. The thing that I am really excited about is the accelerating pace of mobile and the mobile experience that we have. 
Historically, we've operated our websites in 2 separate platforms. We're in the process of bringing those together on a fully responsibly-designed website. And most importantly, we're going through a cultural change inside the company of really thinking digital first and mobile first. Historically, in this business, the moment of truth was when a customer crossed the lease line into a story. 
Today, as a company, we are increasingly seeing the moment of truth is when a customer, through their phone, comes into our digital store and we either win or lose their affection, their engagement, and ultimately, their sales if we win or lose at that moment of truth. And that creates for us both an opportunity, but also an imperative to move as fast as the customer is moving in mobile. 
This year, the bulk of our traffic will be mobile traffic to our digital space. That represents an opportunity because a great majority of that traffic is incremental, but it also means that we offer the customer an emotional, immersive, holistic, engaging brand experience along with what we have historically done extremely well, which is a very efficient e-commerce transactional experience. 
The last priority is talent and the entire company sits on a foundation of talent. We've been able to attract and retain exceptional talent and I am committed to making sure that this company has the best talent in the industry lined up in our businesses and our functions. As you all know yet, I've not named a permanent head of our Old Navy brand. When you have a seat like that is empty, which is one of the biggest seats in the business, I want to take my time to make sure that I understand, looking forward, what's the right profile of leadership for that seat and to understand our talent inside and outside the company in a way where I can make a decision that I feel is the best decision for the brand and the company. 
Part of what I've spent my time on over the last few months is getting very deep into the Old Navy business and I'll speak more about that in a moment. To really understand where the growth opportunities, which are significant, but where are those growth opportunities inside of Old Navy and how do we map a leadership role against the pursuit of those growth opportunities. I knew Old Navy pretty well. Several months ago, I've been much deeper with the team over there over the last few months and what I will honestly and directly say to you is as much as I was bullish about the opportunity in front of Old Navy before for long-term continuous growth, I'm even that much more bullish today. I see a great brand and a compelling value proposition that I believe has the potential to hunt around the world. And I'm super excited about the growth prospects in front of that business. 
So let's dive in a little bit more into each of the brands and just talk a little bit about my observations of 2015. So just to be clear -- and I'll start with Old Navy since I was talking about Old Navy. Four years of growth. That is a business that has demonstrated that the brand is strong and that the value proposition for masspirational passion, on trend, appropriate to the brand, with great quality that she perceives and understands for the entire family, that's a compelling value proposition. 
We hit a bump in the road in Q4 and let me be clear about this. What happened in Q4, we have diagnosed and it was a combination of factors that unfortunately came together. First was we had a couple of style misses. We had a little bit of excess clearance inventory that we carried through. We had an unexpected drop of traffic, which has now, for the most part, corrected itself. The team is honest. I know we're making the right changes, and I expect Old Navy to get back on track and continue to deliver that kind of market share-leading performance that we've seen now over the course of the last 4 years. 
Let me go to Banana for a moment. I knew it was going to be a rebuilding year from a product and aesthetic standpoint. We took Banana to a place where we were trying to lead on fashion and trend and she does not want Banana to be that. We've diagnosed it. We had fixed it. I've seen the spring product. I've seen the summer product, but we got behind it in 2015 and I'm disappointed with the performance. But here is again what I'm confident about in Banana, which is we've been doing the right work. I feel we have a very strong team in place right now. We have centered on the classic, appropriate, expected aesthetics of the brand and I feel much more comfortable that we are on track as we get into spring, summer and then fall this year. 
So moving quickly to Athleta. We delivered a very strong back half performance in Athleta. We have a business that is very well positioned for our customer. It is right in the sweet spot of lifestyle trend. It is fundamentally omni-channel and that it came from being a catalog and online business with now over 100 stores in the portfolio and I continue to be very bullish about the upside of that business and the growth potential. 
Just as a sidebar, I would point out that I've been very supportive in them continuing to look for incremental growth opportunities on top of that solid platform. And a few weeks ago, we announced that we are building out an assortment for all the way from a very young girl up to a teenager inside of the Athleta box. We're not putting incremental real estate behind that, rather we're putting it in our existing stores and we feel that is a significant opportunity. So a great business, one I'm super happy to have in our portfolio, and I expect that you will continue to hear more news about Athleta going forward. 
Okay. Last, let me finish as I talk about our brands with Gap brand. And I was kind of starting and ending with Gap brand when we started speaking a year ago. I knew we had a rebuilding year in front of us. It started with new leadership, a new team around that leadership. It worked to get the brand centered back on its casual optimistic American aesthetic and then rebalancing the assortment to assert our rightful share in key categories where Gap has always played. So the last couple of weeks I've been in stores. I'm always in stores at the beginning of a big seasonal flow with the cross functional team after our customers have had an opportunity to engage our products. 
First thing I would highlight is a renewed energy in our stores. It is partly a function of our field team, which is world-class. It is partly a function of the fact that we have product in the stores that lights the stores up. It's optimistic. It's colorful. It's feminine for the women. It's masculine for the man. It's got the right level of sophistication for Gap as a brand and it is much more centered in what the appropriate aesthetic is for the brand. So I see the aesthetic coming through very strong, casual optimistic American.
Second thing I see across key categories, a niche complex that is fully developed to take advantage of share of wallet in knits. We have silhouettes and fabrication that cover a wide range of uses. We have color. We have print. We have pattern. We have neutrals. We have great quality in those knits and I see strong progress forward just by asserting our right to actually play as we should be playing in knits. 
Third, denim, core category of Gap. It's what the spring campaign has been focused on. Silhouettes, fabrications, wash and novelty, all right in the sweet spot of where denim trend is right now and I'm really optimistic about what I see coming in the denim business across all of our brands, but particularly in Gap brand. And so, again, I could go on, and on about this. I could talk about our woven shirts programs. I could talk about intentional outerwear development, but I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that the team has made against their diagnosis a year ago on what needed to happen and how the product now shows up in the stores in front of our customers.
One of the things I want to reiterate and just make sure everybody hears it and I'll say this again every time we talk is, I have strong conviction about the long-term growth prospects of this company and the work that we are doing to reestablish our dominance in key categories in our businesses to reassert appropriate aesthetic expression of our brands, the continued growth across all of our channels and the broad-based geographic growth that we've put a structure in place to achieve. I am committed to that and we will continue to move down that path. 
Why I spend so much time talking about product? Because product is the foundation for gaining market share. And so I want to emphasize the fact that our commitment for growth is not just a commitment of building new stores and new geographies while taking new channels to new places. It's also about moving these brands back to a place where they can gain market share in our core markets.
So 2015, a year of rebuilding, a year of focusing on getting our product back on track, reestablishing the path for a couple of our key brands. I'm confident in Old Navy, a bump in the road, but I'm confident in the value proposition and what that brand means to our consumers. 
What I can assure you is, my team and I have a great deal of urgency. I know what this company is capable of at our best. I know what these brands are capable of at their best and I and my team are focused on, not just achieving that for a moment, but achieving that with the consistency. I'm looking forward to this coming year. I'm looking forward to seeing these brands start to perform to their potential, and I want to thank you for your support. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."

Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016. It's important to note that our reported results include pretax costs related to our previously announced strategic actions totaling $25 million for the quarter and $132 million for the year. That is at the low end of our guidance range of $130 million to $140 million. $98 million of the total full year charge is operating expense and the remainder hits gross margin. 
Now, starting with sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.4 billion. Comp sales were down 7%. For the full year, comp sales were down 4%. On a reported basis, 2015 net sales were $15.8 billion. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales would have totaled $16.2 billion, down 2%. 
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.4 billion and gross margin contracted 240 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margin was down 140 basis points as reported, but down only 80 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $5.7 billion and gross margin was down 210 basis points to 36.2%. Merchandise margin was down 130 basis points as reported, but down only 60 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 80 basis points. 
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion. Marketing expenses totaled $169 million, $9 million below last year. For the full year, marketing expenses declined $61 million to $578 million. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion, about flat to last year. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.53 and full year EPS totaled $2.23. Excluding the impact of our strategic actions, adjusted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter and $2.43 for the year. Additionally, it's important to remember that FX negatively impacted full year EPS by an estimated $0.14 or about 5 percentage points of growth. 
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. On a net basis, we closed 5 stores in 2015 and our square footage remained about flat. This includes about 150 Gap specialty store closures, broadly in line with our guidance. So our counts in square footage are listed in our press release. 
Capital expenditures totaled $726 million, which was below our guidance as we prudently reacted to the tougher business performance. Regarding balance sheet and cash flow. As a testament to the cash generating power of our business, in an otherwise difficult year, free cash flow totaled about $870 million. Consistent with our commitment to distributing excess cash, we paid $377 million in dividends and returned $1 billion through repurchases during the year. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash and our ending share count was 397 million shares. Inventory dollars per store were about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance and total inventory was down 1%. 
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2016. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 and operating margin to be about 9.5%. Embedded in our full year guidance is a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $120 million in EBIT, which equates to about $0.19 of EPS or 8 percentage points of EPS growth off of 2015's $2.43. 
Let me say more about foreign exchange given its significance. Our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan with combined sales in these 2 countries of about $2 billion. 2016 will be the fourth consecutive year, with meaningful headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Note that our hedges help to delay, but not eliminate the impact of depreciating foreign currencies. 
To paint the picture of how dramatically currency movements have impacted our results in recent years, I'd like to offer a few metrics. The cumulative impact of weaker foreign currencies to our reported sales results was more than $700 million over the past 3 years. Absent these headwinds, 2015 net sales would have totaled $16.5 billion, up about $900 million since 2012. The impact to the bottom line is also meaningful. We estimate that the impact to EPS has been about $0.40 since 2012.
Here are some additional 2016 guidance metrics. We expect to add 40 net new stores with square footage to remain about flat. In line with our strategy, openings will be focused on China outlet and Athleta, while closures will continue to be weighted toward gap brand. We are reducing capital spending in 2016 to support improvement in return on invested capital. We expect capital expenditures to be about $650 million with a continued focus on mobile and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $560 million. Given our comp includes both store and online sales, we decided to guided to total inventory in 2016. We expect total inventory to be down in the low single-digits at the end of the first quarter.
Regarding expenses, it's important to note that SG&A may deleverage against our 2015 reported levels as we potentially restore some categories of expense, such as incentive-based comp. And lastly, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%. 
Finally, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. As a reminder, our $400 million term loan matures in 2016. We currently intend to allocate a portion of our cash flow to repay this. Therefore, 2016 repurchases will likely be meaningfully lower than our historic average. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a challenging year for us and others in our sector. Despite our disappointing performance, it's important to highlight some of our strengths as we enter 2016. First, we believe that our size and portfolio of brands are a competitive advantage in areas such as sourcing, real estate and e-commerce. Second, as our track record has demonstrated, we of course plan to maintain our operating discipline. And finally, our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet allow us to make investments in areas like technology and supply chain needed to win in this evolving retail landscape over the long term. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

And we have our eyes really on it. Probably the one thing I'll call out is, overall, 2 stores in a very large market haven't had a noticeable impact yet. And so if I looked across our whole business, too early to call that at the end of the day, Downtown Crossing specifically where you note that we do have a Gap factory store. Business has remained strong in that store. Traffic is strong in that area. A big grand opening, in fact with Primark opening as well. But it's very early days, and we're on it. We're watching it. My issue there always with a new competitor, particularly one like Primark. It does come in with very sharp price points, with an everyday low-pricing policy. Very intrigued to see how the American consumer responds to that against the backdrop of how the whole sector typically prices, which is obviously more promotional pricing.

So that was a portion in the fourth quarter as well as throughout the year, but probably especially in the fourth quarter of how we brought down the expenses. And then finally, marketing as well.

And so to answer your question, am I comfortable with style misses are behind us? No, we're always going to have some style misses, obviously. Design's job is to push creatively and merchandising's job is to counterbalance that with a commercial orientation. We all, across our brands, and frankly across the industry, one of the bigger style misses of last year was tops went to a silhouette that was a little bit shorter and a little boxier and many women voted that it wasn't very feminine. It wasn't very flattering. And it was a style that was out there, but it was a style that, frankly, didn't really register with a lot of customers, and that's a good learning. I mean, the word femininity is one that continues to be one that I'm pushing to the front, whether it's across tops or bottoms. Probably, a bigger issue. And then there was a little bit of an issue where we got a little bit over assorted. We got pretty enthusiastic about some sweater styles, where there was duplicative choice. And it meant that she came in and she bought -- it was an or versus an end.

It's a lot of things and I continue to ask myself this as well, which is -- because I'm very impatient on marching against the metrics that I know we need to do. So let me just highlight a bunch of things. And again, I'm not going to go through specific quantitative analysis here, but several of the things that I feel very confident will register with our consumers as they start to fall back in the assortment. So we just had huge quality business. I mean, literally, places where whether it was fit or the quality of the fabrication, it made the product very difficult to wear. I think I've cited this before, but blazers in Banana Republic women's assortment where it was really difficult for the average woman to actually get her arm into the armhole. So if you just take those out and you get back to common sense quality that our customers expect, that is going to register with our customers. A second-place, places where we intentionally underdeveloped the product because of either we assumed it wasn't trending or it was the preference of an individual in a seat or whatever. An example of that is knits in -- women's knits in Gap brand, where we underdeveloped last year. We left market share on the table. And this year, we have very intentional development across fabrications and silhouettes that we believe play in the relevant wear categories and wear occasions for us. And that's another place where I call it sort of reasserting development to get our fair share of market share. And I've been in the stores now and looked at that and I'd encourage you to do that. You can see where we actually have a significant knits complex built out. Accessories would be the same. There is a spectacular singed valley flat. I think it's in 10 colors that's now in the stores and we do business all day long with that. And it wasn't in the stores a year ago. And so those are places where -- again, question, why we did it, but we've gone back in and said our fair share, we play here, this is where the brand plays. And then the last thing is the more complicated questions around our responsive capabilities. And so again, that is a journey right now, but we have in our tool of programs in spring as an example and I've talked about this before, the ability to be much faster in the product that is selling on our shelves to a combination of owning the fabric, having the fabric positioned approximate to vendors who have the capacity reserve to cut and saw into it. And ideally, those vendors, particularly for North America in the Caribbean basin, so that we can cut, saw, wash and dye, put it on a boat and have it back in our stores very quickly. All of those things to me are kind of obvious that they will give us upside. So the only issue on my mind right now isn't will these things work an impact? It's just the pace and the timing. Sabrina noted in Gap brand that our traffic has been toughest there. Frankly, in my mind, because we've been off brand for longest there. So the pace and the timing of when the  customer comes back discovers the product, embraces it, tweets about it, post it on Instagram and Pinterest, that's really the unknown right now. But I'm very optimistic."

I would say right now, we feel comfortable with the fleet size. We feel like that sweet spot where we are is a good number. We will work it continuously, and we we're always looking at opportunities to either put a store in place like the Times Square that we announced, where there'll be a Gap and an Old Navy going into Times Square or a store, if it's not delivering or we feel like the real estate is not appropriate for the brand, we'll get out of that real estate. But at the moment, I'm not ready to call a number different than where we are as we look forward. Second thing I would really focus on though and I've talked about this is I'm a strong believer in the fact that we can do more business in less real estate in the same location. And that is what we're focused on. Obviously, you can't flip the fleet overnight into smaller stores, but every opportunity we have, whether it's a lease coming up or a reposition or an opportunity to give some space back and densify, we're going to be taking aggressively advantage of those opportunities. And I'm Gap's got the biggest opportunity there in my view. I -- we tried a store in China. I was in that store a couple of weeks ago and super pleased by what I saw. It was a very small store footprint with a full expression of Gap brand and most importantly, it worked for the consumer. And so the early days of really thinking aggressively about densifying through fixtures, through holding versus -- folding versus hanging through how we use the total cube of the store, aisle width, all those kinds of things. I'm very encouraged by the opportunity there. But again, that's not an overnight flip."

But let's just basically talk about one of the things that cuts out many weeks, which is making a multi-season commitment to a fabric and then having that fabric prepositioned to cut, wash, dye and sew into. That is -- most powerful is the capability in cotton fabrications. And so that applies to denim, to twill, to knits, et cetera, really consistently across all the brands. If you start getting into synthetics and then obviously, wool, silk, and those types of things, it's less an issue there because you just can't necessarily platform those fabrics. Although you can some of them, not all of them. Importantly, you can also platform yarns for sweaters at the end of the day. So if I think about the least relevant categories, probably accessories or outerwear. Most relevant would be our core cotton fabrications, which we have and are an important part of the business across all of our brands in denim, in twill, in knits, in fleece, et cetera. So this is -- we wouldn't be pushing on something here if it wasn't meaningful for the entire business. Importantly, it's actually also meaningful for Athleta in water and performance fabrics as well. So this is something that's largely applicable to the total company."

And then with regard to merch margins, Oliver, we don't explicitly guide to merch margin, only the operating margin, which I gave you. But to be helpful, there's sort of headwinds and tailwinds.

Also on the margin, I would say, although I wouldn't -- I don't want to make it any kind of big headline, but on the margin, there are certainly some average unit cost tailwind. So those are the 2 tailwinds. On the flip side, you have foreign exchange, which we've guided has -- is actually growing in 2016. And remember, in 2015, it hurt our merchandise margins by 50 basis points and it's bound to be even bigger in 2016. So underlying basis, of course, we're hoping to get some merch margin expansion, but you kind of have to weigh that against the headwind of foreign exchange."

I'm really, really big on making sure that we understand the best floor wall model, what kind of sites that's located in, whether it's a lifestyle center or a street front store or a value center or whatever. And also, the store size. And then, once we are comfortable with that, put the hammer down on opening real estate after we've got the floor wall model done. And with Old Navy, I am not worried about real estate availability. When that business hunts, it hunts in a big way and it also is a big traffic draw. And so there's a lot of landlord interest out there. So the pace to me right now is going to be set by making sure that we've really got the floor wall model correctly.

As the spring products has gotten into the stores, and I've been out in stores a lot. And I've been out in stores a lot on an unannounced basis because I want to see what our customers are seeing versus what's been prepped for CEO visits. And I went into the, I'll just call one store out right now. Went into the store that we have, flagship store on 54TH & 5TH last week in New York. Product was fully expressed there for spring. We flipped that store. We brought women's down from the second floor down to the first and I walked in and I have to honestly say I'm not sure I've ever felt like that store showed up better as an expression of Gap brand. The color was evident, the femininity was clear. We have strong ownership and it's clear why we're in the business from the standpoint of women's bottoms, whether it's twill, denim or by stretch bottoms. The accessories statement was very powerful. And so if I think about a from to of last year, neutral color palette, unfeminine silhouettes, some quality issues in our business, lots of overlapping denim development, et cetera, i feel like the from to is optimistic print pattern and color, feminine silhouettes, intentional denim development, ownership in the bottoms business, great accessories business. And so it's a big step in the right direction. The most important metric I look at, and I'm not going to go into the detail of this, is as we're obviously working our way through product from last year, clearance product, et cetera, I want to look at the new product that's current season code and understand how we bought it and then what kind of comp we're running off of it in those are the most important early leading-edge indicators. So whether we're seeing good customer acceptance in the product so that's what I'm looking at right now. And then it'll eventually aggregate, obviously, if we're seeing good customer acceptance, we're overselling our by plan. That will aggregate the comp."

Athleta had, and I think we mentioned this and I'll just underline it, very strong back half and I was really pleased with that. The assortment was in line. They were on trend. The product was well bought and I was really pleased with the numbers. If you look at Old Navy, because you raised that specifically, we have had excellent performance out of the full family expression of activewear inside of Old Navy. We have been a little bit more promotional. So you're correct on that. But that does not signal anything other than we still have excellence performance out of that business, and we're seeing very strong growth. I'm really encouraged, frankly, across the whole company as I look at it right now because if you take Athleta, Old Navy's full family active expression, add to it a young girl to tween expression inside of Athleta and then a full family expression inside of Gap, we are present and accounted for in the mainstream of what is probably the most important ready-to-wear trend that we've seen since skinny denim maybe came on the scene. So I feel like we're very well represented there. We have great fabrics, great development and as a company, we can share assets across the company, across fabric platforming and things like that. So it's a powerful place for us to be. If I specifically look at Athleta's growth rates, and again, I've said this before, we are learning every day what the right mix of online catalog and stores is in the Athleta business. It's the opposite of what has happened in mainstream retail, where people have gone online from a store's business where in Athleta, we've gone into stores from an online and catalog business. And our initial expectation, as we start to open stores, was that it would probably be cannibalizing of our online business. And as we've learned and seen how the store channel and the direct channel interact with each other, we're really pleased to see that the direct business continues to grow, even as we open stores and that as she discovers it in a store, she goes to direct, et cetera. So I can't tell you I know what the right fleet size is right now. What I can tell you is that if I can grow this business in a highly accretive way without putting additional CapEx and the fixed expenses of our operating stores into the ground and continue to see that growth happen to our existing stores in the online channel, that's a very attractive thing to do. So I'm just -- we're taking it slow and easy right now as we continue to explore the channel dynamics, but I am in no way signaling the fact that we have nothing, but -- anything but very strong growth expectations out of that business."

Frankly, the reason we've gone there is that's where the customer is and we've got to go where the customer is right now. And the whole outlet business has continued to morph over the last decade. It used to be a business that was highly physically isolated relative to the specialty business and obviously, there's been a collision going on where outlets get closer to specialty and the suburbs have spread out to where the outlet malls where built. And the online channel is another extension of that at the end of the day. That's where our customer is and we felt the need to have a presence there. It's early days right now. We're in our early days of having this channel. It's very difficult to identify anything that's cannibalizing anything, frankly, versus the fact that it's complementary to the existing outlet channel, but we're watching it very carefully and we are trying to understand how it interacts, number one, with our outlet stores because that's critical, but then number two, with the specialty business as well.

And when we were closing and downsizing a lot of the unproductive square footage, we were able to leverage very easily, even on negative comps on some years, but that is all behind us now. What is happening now is the international stores actually are a big headwind because as a percent of sales, they are a higher percent to sales. Now within their country every year, we are trying to get them to leverage, but from a mix perspective, they hurt the overall ROD profile. So where we sit today is it takes sort of a low single-digit comp to leverage ROD."

I'm pleased to be speaking to you as we kick off 2016. We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments and some places where I feel like we need to continue to accelerate progress. I've spoken to you about this before and we're on a journey that is going to continue to take time both against our digital priorities as well as our product priorities. And so I want to spend a few minutes speaking to that and then I will focus a little bit on 2016 and where we are.  
So when I spoke to you a year ago and frankly, each quarter that we've had this conversation, I've reiterated the fact that we have 3 core priorities in this company. The first one is product. And so we are, at our core, a fashion apparel company and our customers come to us for great, emotional, on trend, on brand product. And a lot of the work that we have been doing in 2015 is continuing to move our brands forward to get centered on their aesthetic, centered on the right trends, to restore the appropriate quality to our products and to really put in place the products in our stores that we know that our customers love. And I'm really pleased with the quality of the work and the quantity of the work and the pace of the work that we've been doing across the entire company against our product priorities. 
And I've spoken to you about my vision of how products is changing in this industry. It's fascinating as you look at how the fashion week activities have played out over the last couple of weeks. A lot of articles out there about how brands are now making product available on runway immediately to their consumers. We did that in a small way also in Banana Republic. To me, what that illustrates is the increasing clock speed inside of this business, how fast trend at the high end of the market disseminates down into the mass market. And it's against that backdrop of increasing clock speed, increasing pace of this business that we've been making very significant changes in our product process. And I'm not going to go into all of those today, but those are changes focused on getting better and better each season at managing buying risk, as we build our assortments, and increasingly responsive and short supply chain, using science blended with the art of creativity, design and merchandising to build the best possible assortments for our brand and putting in place a very solid commercial planning process that allows us to make sure that we're building a commercial assortment that is on trend, on brand, with the right quality, mapped against delivering and exceeding our budget priorities. That is not all coming to fruition yet, but I'm, again, pleased with the work that we're doing. 
There are a couple of key components there that I want to call out. I am a true believer in quality, a big believer in quality and I believe that our customers are very sophisticated when it comes to understanding the value that we offer them in our products. And I'm extremely pleased with the quality restoration that I see in Gap's products and in Banana Republic as we look at the spring assortment and the summer assortment going forward. 
Second issue as I've talked about responsiveness in our supply chain. This is a journey, and again, I'm not going to tell you what yard line we're on or give you a numerical score, but we are making significant and rapid progress, progress that is reflected in platforming product where we're buying fabrics over multi-season buys, positioning that fabric with key strategic vendors, giving us responsive capabilities, and in some cases, to leave open to buy in season so that we can be back into product in season. In essence, buying what's working rather than guessing what's going to work. 
The third thing is progress on inventory management. And a big step that we took forward was a couple of years ago where we brought all of our inventory pools across our online and our stores together. We've made further progress this year where we've leveraged our retail DCs to provide direct fulfillment capacity for our online business, and we're continuing to take steps to make sure that we are stranding the least amount of inventory and getting every penny of gross margin out of all of our units across the entire business, regardless of what store it's in or what channel it was brought to fulfill. 
Second priority is experience. And on experience, I will call out a number of things we're doing, we're modernizing our POS. I've talked about that before. We've built a number of omni-channel capabilities. We've virtualized our inventory so that we have access to all of our inventory across all of our demand. The thing that I am really excited about is the accelerating pace of mobile and the mobile experience that we have. 
Historically, we've operated our websites on 2 separate platforms. We're in the process of bringing those together on a fully responsibly-designed website. And most importantly, we're going through a cultural change inside the company of really thinking digital first and mobile first. Historically, in this business, the moment of truth was when a customer crossed the lease line into a store. 
Today, as a company, we are increasingly seeing the moment of truth is when a customer, through their phone, comes into our digital store and we either win or lose their affection, their engagement, and ultimately, their sales if we win or lose at that moment of truth. And that creates for us both an opportunity, but also an imperative to move as fast as the customer is moving in mobile. 
This year, the bulk of our traffic will be mobile traffic to our digital space. That represents an opportunity because a great majority of that traffic is incremental, but it also means that we offer the customer an emotional, immersive, holistic, engaging brand experience along with what we have historically done extremely well, which is a very efficient e-commerce transactional experience. 
The last priority is talent and the entire company sits on a foundation of talent. We've been able to attract and retain exceptional talent and I am committed to making sure that this company has the best talent in the industry lined up in our businesses and our functions. As you all know yet, I've not named a permanent head of our Old Navy brand. When you have a seat like that is empty, which is one of the biggest seats in the business, I want to take my time to make sure that I understand, looking forward, what's the right profile of leadership for that seat and to understand our talent inside and outside the company in a way where I can make a decision that I feel is the best decision for the brand and the company. 
Part of what I've spent my time on over the last few months is getting very deep into the Old Navy business and I'll speak more about that in a moment. To really understand where the growth opportunities, which are significant, but where are those growth opportunities inside of Old Navy and how do we map a leadership role against the pursuit of those growth opportunities. I knew Old Navy pretty well. Several months ago, I've been much deeper with the team over there over the last few months and what I will honestly and directly say to you is as much as I was bullish about the opportunity in front of Old Navy before for long-term continuous growth, I'm even that much more bullish today. I see a great brand and a compelling value proposition that I believe has the potential to hunt around the world. And I'm super excited about the growth prospects in front of that business. 
So let's dive in a little bit more into each of the brands and just talk a little bit about my observations of 2015. So just to be clear -- and I'll start with Old Navy since I was talking about Old Navy. Four years of growth. That is a business that has demonstrated that the brand is strong and that the value proposition for masspirational fashion, on trend, appropriate to the brand, with great quality that she perceives and understands for the entire family, that's a compelling value proposition. 
We hit a bump in the road in Q4 and let me be clear about this. What happened in Q4, we have diagnosed and it was a combination of factors that unfortunately came together. First was we had a couple of style misses. We had a little bit of excess clearance inventory that we carried through. We had an unexpected drop of traffic, which has now, for the most part, corrected itself. The team is on it. I know we're making the right changes, and I expect Old Navy to get back on track and continue to deliver the kind of market share-leading performance that we've seen now over the course of the last 4 years. 
Let me go to Banana for a moment. I knew it was going to be a rebuilding year from a product and aesthetic standpoint. We took Banana to a place where we were trying to lead on fashion and trend and she does not want Banana to be that. We've diagnosed it. We had fixed it. I've seen the spring product. I've seen the summer product, but we got behind it in 2015 and I'm disappointed with the performance. But here is again what I'm confident about in Banana, which is we've been doing the right work. I feel we have a very strong team in place right now. We have centered on the classic, appropriate, expected aesthetics of the brand and I feel much more comfortable that we are on track as we get into spring, summer and then fall this year. 
So moving quickly to Athleta. We delivered a very strong back half performance in Athleta. We have a business that is very well positioned for our customer. It is right in the sweet spot of lifestyle trend. It is fundamentally omni-channel in that it came from being a catalog and online business with now over 100 stores in the portfolio and I continue to be very bullish about the upside of that business and the growth potential. 
Just as a sidebar, I would point out that I've been very supportive in them continuing to look for incremental growth opportunities on top of that solid platform. And a few weeks ago, we announced that we are building out an assortment for all the way from a very young girl up to a teenager inside of the Athleta box. We're not putting incremental real estate behind that, rather we're putting it in our existing stores and we feel that is a significant opportunity. So a great business, one I'm super happy to have in our portfolio, and I expect that you will continue to hear more news about Athleta going forward. 
Okay. Last, let me finish as I talk about our brands with Gap brand. And I was kind of starting and ending with Gap brand when we started speaking a year ago. I knew we had a rebuilding year in front of us. It started with new leadership, a new team around that leadership. It worked to get the brand centered back on its casual optimistic American aesthetic and then rebalancing the assortment to assert our rightful share in key categories where Gap has always played. So the last couple of weeks I've been in stores. I'm always in stores at the beginning of a big seasonal flow with the cross functional team after our customers have had an opportunity to engage our products. 
First thing I would highlight is a renewed energy in our stores. It is partly a function of our field team, which is world-class. It is partly a function of the fact that we have product in the stores that lights the stores up. It's optimistic. It's colorful. It's feminine for the women. It's masculine for the man. It's got the right level of sophistication for Gap as a brand and it is much more centered in what the appropriate aesthetic is for the brand. So I see the aesthetic coming through very strong, casual optimistic American.
Second thing I see across key categories, a knits complex that is fully developed to take advantage of share of wallet in knits. We have silhouettes and fabrication that cover a wide range of uses. We have color. We have print. We have pattern. We have neutrals. We have great quality in those knits and I see strong progress forward just by asserting our right to actually play as we should be playing in knits. 
Third, denim, core category of Gap. It's what the spring campaign has been focused on. Silhouettes, fabrications, wash and novelty, all right in the sweet spot of where denim trend is right now and I'm really optimistic about what I see coming in the denim business across all of our brands, but particularly in Gap brand. And so, again, I could go on and on about this. I could talk about our woven shirts programs. I could talk about intentional outerwear development, but I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that the team has made against their diagnosis a year ago on what needed to happen and how the product now shows up in the stores in front of our customers.
One of the things I want to reiterate and just make sure everybody hears it and I'll say this again every time we talk is, I have strong conviction about the long-term growth prospects of this company and the work that we are doing to reestablish our dominance in key categories in our businesses to reassert appropriate aesthetic expression of our brands, the continued growth across all of our channels and the broad-based geographic growth that we've put a structure in place to achieve. I am committed to that and we will continue to move down that path. 
Why I spend so much time talking about product? Because product is the foundation for gaining market share. And so I want to emphasize the fact that our commitment for growth is not just a commitment of building new stores and new geographies while taking new channels to new places. It's also about moving these brands back to a place where they can gain market share in our core markets.
So 2015, a year of rebuilding, a year of focusing on getting our product back on track, reestablishing the path for a couple of our key brands. I'm confident in Old Navy, a bump in the road, but I'm confident in the value proposition and what that brand means to our consumers. 
What I can assure you is, my team and I have a great deal of urgency. I know what this company is capable of at our best. I know what these brands are capable of at their best and I and my team are focused on, not just achieving that for a moment, but achieving that with consistency. I'm looking forward to this coming year. I'm looking forward to seeing these brands start to perform to their potential, and I want to thank you for your support. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."
274265,325054017,941649,"The Gap, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016. It's important to note that our reported results include pretax costs related to our previously announced strategi",1065,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016. It's important to note that our reported results include pretax costs related to our previously announced strategic actions totaling $25 million for the quarter and $132 million for the year. That is at the low end of our guidance range of $130 million to $140 million. $98 million of the total full year charge is operating expense and the remainder hits gross margin. 
Now, starting with sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.4 billion. Comp sales were down 7%. For the full year, comp sales were down 4%. On a reported basis, 2015 net sales were $15.8 billion. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales would have totaled $16.2 billion, down 2%. 
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.4 billion and gross margin contracted 240 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margin was down 140 basis points as reported, but down only 80 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $5.7 billion and gross margin was down 210 basis points to 36.2%. Merchandise margin was down 130 basis points as reported, but down only 60 basis points, excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 80 basis points. 
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion. Marketing expenses totaled $169 million, $9 million below last year. For the full year, marketing expenses declined $61 million to $578 million. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion, about flat to last year. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.53 and full year EPS totaled $2.23. Excluding the impact of our strategic actions, adjusted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter and $2.43 for the year. Additionally, it's important to remember that FX negatively impacted full year EPS by an estimated $0.14 or about 5 percentage points of growth. 
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. On a net basis, we closed 5 stores in 2015 and our square footage remained about flat. This includes about 150 Gap specialty store closures, broadly in line with our guidance. So our counts in square footage are listed in our press release. 
Capital expenditures totaled $726 million, which was below our guidance as we prudently reacted to the tougher business performance. Regarding balance sheet and cash flow. As a testament to the cash generating power of our business, in an otherwise difficult year, free cash flow totaled about $870 million. Consistent with our commitment to distributing excess cash, we paid $377 million in dividends and returned $1 billion through repurchases during the year. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash and our ending share count was 397 million shares. Inventory dollars per store were about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance, and total inventory was down 1%. 
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2016. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 and operating margin to be about 9.5%. Embedded in our full year guidance is a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $120 million in EBIT, which equates to about $0.19 of EPS or 8 percentage points of EPS growth off of 2015's $2.43. 
Let me say more about foreign exchange given its significance. Our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan with combined sales in these 2 countries of about $2 billion. 2016 will be the fourth consecutive year, with meaningful headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Note that our hedges help to delay, but not eliminate the impact of depreciating foreign currencies. 
To paint the picture of how dramatically currency movements have impacted our results in recent years, I'd like to offer a few metrics. The cumulative impact of weaker foreign currencies to our reported sales results was more than $700 million over the past 3 years. Absent these headwinds, 2015 net sales would have totaled $16.5 billion, up about $900 million since 2012. The impact to the bottom line is also meaningful. We estimate that the impact to EPS has been about $0.40 since 2012.
Here are some additional 2016 guidance metrics. We expect to add 40 net new stores with square footage to remain about flat. In line with our strategy, openings will be focused on China outlet and Athleta, while closures will continue to be weighted toward Gap brand. We are reducing capital spending in 2016 to support improvement in return on invested capital. We expect capital expenditures to be about $650 million with a continued focus on mobile and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $560 million. Given our comp includes both store and online sales, we decided to guide to total inventory in 2016. We expect total inventory to be down in the low single-digits at the end of the first quarter.
Regarding expenses, it's important to note that SG&A may deleverage against our 2015 reported levels as we potentially restore some categories of expense, such as incentive-based comp. And lastly, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%. 
Finally, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. As a reminder, our $400 million term loan matures in 2016. We currently intend to allocate a portion of our cash flow to repay this. Therefore, 2016 repurchases will likely be meaningfully lower than our historic average. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a challenging year for us and others in our sector. Despite our disappointing performance, it's important to highlight some of our strengths as we enter 2016. First, we believe that our size and portfolio of brands are a competitive advantage in areas such as sourcing, real estate and e-commerce. Second, as our track record has demonstrated, we of course plan to maintain our operating discipline. And finally, our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet allow us to make investments in areas like technology and supply chain needed to win in this evolving retail landscape over the long term. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

Now Old Navy, for most of the year, had pretty solid traffic, slightly negative, but certainly beating our read of mall traffic. The surprise at Old Navy really came in the month of November and December where it fell off significantly. It did return in January. We're not getting overly excited about that because January is a clearance month. So it's really important to see how we do on traffic in the first quarter. But again, Banana was the strongest, Gap was the weakest, Old Navy's was pretty good up until November and December."

So we've talked about the fact that over half of our expense base is related to our stores and over half of that is variable to sales. So when we have sales come down and as they did in the fourth quarter, we get some natural variability and expenses come down as well. I mentioned in my previous response as well as in my prepared remarks that we obviously paid minimal bonus in 2015. So that was a portion in the fourth quarter as well as throughout the year, but probably especially in the fourth quarter of how we brought down the expenses. And then finally, marketing as well.

That said, we're going to continue to manage our expenses very, very tightly so you can count on us from an absolute perspective to manage them quite tightly. And I think we've proven that we're pretty adept at using the levers depending on how business is performing to bring those in-line."

And so to answer your question, am I comfortable that style misses are behind us? No, we're always going to have some style misses, obviously. Design's job is to push creatively and merchandising's job is to counterbalance that with a commercial orientation. We all, across our brands, and frankly across the industry, one of the bigger style misses of last year was tops went to a silhouette that was a little bit shorter and a little boxier and many women voted that it wasn't very feminine and it wasn't very flattering. And it was a style that was out there, but it was a style that, frankly, didn't really register with a lot of customers, and that's a good learning. I mean, the word femininity is one that continues to be one that I'm pushing to the front, whether it's across tops or bottoms. Probably, a bigger issue. And then there was a little bit of an issue where we got a little bit over assorted. We got pretty enthusiastic about some sweater styles, where there was duplicative choice. And it meant that she came in and she bought -- it was an or versus an and. And again, I'm confident that Sabrina and I have leaned in with the team and learned about the business and looked at how we bought it in. In February and March and April, obviously, looking at that and making sure where we reregistering where we need to be from a style count and a trend standpoint. We're always going to have some misses. I mean, the whole point of the work we're doing is to minimize the misses. And as I keep saying, guess less, guess better and fix faster. Sabrina?"

It's a lot of things and I continue to ask myself this as well, which is -- because I'm very impatient on marching against the metrics that I know we need to do. So let me just highlight a bunch of things. And again, I'm not going to go through specific quantitative analysis here, but several of the things that I feel very confident will register with our consumers as they start to fall back in the assortment. So we just had huge quality misses. I mean, literally, places where whether it was fit or the quality of the fabrication, it made the product very difficult to wear. I think I've cited this before, but blazers in Banana Republic women's assortment where it was extremely difficult for the average woman to actually get her arm into the armhole. So if you just take those out and you get back to common sense quality that our customers expect, that is going to register with our customers. A second-place, places where we intentionally underdeveloped the product because of either we assumed it wasn't trending or it was the preference of an individual in a seat or whatever. An example of that is knits in -- women's knits in Gap brand, where we underdeveloped last year. We left market share on the table. And this year, we have very intentional development across fabrications and silhouettes that we believe play in the relevant wear categories and wear occasions for us. And that's another place where I call it sort of reasserting development to get our fair share of market share. And I've been in the stores now and looked at that and I'd encourage you to do that. You can see where we actually have a significant knits complex built out. Accessories would be the same. There is a spectacular cinch ballet flat. I think it's in 10 colors that's now in the stores and we do business all day long with that. And it wasn't in the stores a year ago. And so those are places where -- again, question, why we did it, but we've gone back in and said our fair share, we play here, this is where the brand plays. And then the last thing is the more complicated questions around our responsive capabilities. And so again, that is a journey right now, but we have in our tool [ph] programs in spring as an example and I've talked about this before, the ability to be much faster into product that is selling on our shelves to a combination of owning the fabric, having the fabric positioned approximate to vendors who have the capacity reserve to cut and sew into it. And ideally, those vendors, particularly for North America in the Caribbean basin, so that we can cut, sew, wash and dye, put it on a boat and have it back in our stores very quickly. All of those things to me are kind of obvious that they will give us upside. So the only issue on my mind right now isn't will these things work an impact? It's just the pace and the timing. Sabrina noted in Gap brand that our traffic has been toughest there. Frankly, in my mind, because we've been off brand for longest there. So the pace and the timing of when the customer comes back, discovers the product, embraces it, tweets about it, post it on Instagram and Pinterest, that's really the unknown right now. But I'm very optimistic."

But at the moment, I'm not ready to call a number different than where we are as we look forward. Second thing I would really focus on though and I've talked about this is I'm a strong believer in the fact that we can do more business in less real estate in the same location. And that is what we're focused on. Obviously, you can't flip the fleet overnight into smaller stores, but every opportunity we have, whether it's a lease coming up or a reposition or an opportunity to give some space back and densify, we're going to be taking aggressively advantage of those opportunities. And I'm -- Gap's got the biggest opportunity there in my view. I -- we tried a store in China. I was in that store a couple of weeks ago and super pleased by what I saw. It was a very small store footprint with a full expression of Gap brand and most importantly, it worked for the consumer. And so the early days of really thinking aggressively about densifying through fixtures, through holding versus -- folding versus hanging through how we use the total cube of the store, aisle width, all those kinds of things. I'm very encouraged by the opportunity there. But again, that's not an overnight flip."

But let's just basically talk about one of the things that cuts out many weeks, which is making a multi-season commitment to a fabric and then having that fabric prepositioned to cut, wash, dye and sew into. That is -- most powerful is the capability in cotton fabrications. And so that applies to denim, to twill, to knits, et cetera, really consistently across all the brands. If you start getting into synthetics and then obviously, wool, silk, and those types of things, it's less an issue there because you just can't necessarily platform those fabrics. Although you can some of them, not all of them. Importantly, you can also platform yarns for sweaters at the end of the day. So if I think about the least relevant categories, probably accessories or outerwear. Most relevant would be our core cotton fabrications, which we have and are an important part of the business across all of our brands in denim, in twill, in knits, in fleece, et cetera. So this is -- we wouldn't be pushing on something here if it wasn't meaningful for the entire business. Importantly, it's actually also meaningful for Athleta in water and performance fabrics as well. So this is something that's largely applicable to the total company."

Also on the margin, I would say, although I wouldn't -- I don't want to make it any kind of big headline, but on the margin, there are certainly some average unit cost tailwind. So those are the 2 tailwinds. On the flip side, you have foreign exchange, which we've guided as -- is actually growing in 2016. And remember, in 2015, it hurt our merchandise margins by 50 basis points and it's bound to be even bigger in 2016.

And I've been out in stores a lot on an unannounced basis because I want to see what our customers are seeing versus what's been prepped for CEO visits. And I went into the, I'll just call one store out right now. Went into the store that we have, flagship store on 54TH & 5TH last week in New York. Product was fully expressed there for spring. We flipped that store. We brought women's down from the second floor down to the first and I walked in and I have to honestly say I'm not sure I've ever felt like that store showed up better as an expression of Gap brand. The color was evident; the femininity was clear. We have strong ownership and it's clear why we're in the business from the standpoint of women's bottoms, whether it's twill, denim or by stretch bottoms. The accessories statement was very powerful. And so if I think about a from-to of last year, neutral color palette, unfeminine silhouettes, some quality issues in our business, lots of overlapping denim development, et cetera, I feel like the from-to is optimistic print pattern and color, feminine silhouettes, intentional denim development, ownership in the bottoms business, great accessories business. And so it's a big step in the right direction. The most important metric I look at, and I'm not going to go into the detail of this, is as we're obviously working our way through product from last year, clearance product, et cetera, I want to look at the new product that's current season code and understand how we bought it and then what kind of comp we're running off of it. And those are the most important early leading-edge indicators of whether we're seeing good customer acceptance of the product so that's what I'm looking at right now. And then it'll eventually aggregate; obviously, if we're seeing good customer acceptance, we're overselling our by plan. That will aggregate the comp."

So I feel like we're very well represented there. We have great fabrics, great development and as a company, we can share assets across the company, across fabric platform and things like that. So it's a powerful place for us to be. If I specifically look at Athleta's growth rates, and again, I've said this before, we are learning every day what the right mix of online catalog and stores is in the Athleta business. It's the opposite of what has happened in mainstream retail, where people have gone online from a store's business where in Athleta, we've gone into stores from an online and catalog business. And our initial expectation, as we start to open stores, was that it would probably be cannibalizing of our online business. And as we've learned and seen how the store channel and the direct channel interact with each other, we're really pleased to see that the direct business continues to grow, even as we open stores and that as she discovers it in a store, she goes to direct, et cetera. So I can't tell you I know what the right fleet size is right now. What I can tell you is that if I can grow this business in a highly accretive way without putting additional CapEx and the fixed expenses of our operating stores into the ground and continue to see that growth happen to our existing stores in the online channel, that's a very attractive thing to do. So I'm just -- we're taking it slow and easy right now as we continue to explore the channel dynamics, but I am in no way signaling the fact that we have nothing, but -- anything but very strong growth expectations out of that business."

Frankly, the reason we've gone there is that's where the customer is and we've got to go where the customer is right now. And the whole outlet business has continued to morph over the last decade. It used to be a business that was highly physically isolated relative to the specialty business and obviously, there's been a collision going on where outlets get closer to specialty and the suburbs have spread out to where the outlet malls were built. And the online channel is another extension of that at the end of the day. That's where our customer is and we felt the need to have a presence there. It's early days right now. We're in our early days of having this channel. It's very difficult to identify anything that's cannibalizing anything, frankly, versus the fact that it's complementary to the existing outlet channel, but we're watching it very carefully and we are trying to understand how it interacts, number one, with our outlet stores because that's critical, but then number two, with the specialty business as well. What I will say is when all the businesses are healthy, the channel distinctions, the price distinctions, et cetera, are very clear to the consumer, but we're watching it very carefully."

With regard to ROD, I would say, look, the team is very focused on always aggressively negotiating the best deals we can, especially given the size of our fleet and the size of our brand portfolio. What is happening and has been happening for the last few years in ROD, we've gotten most of the unproductive stores behind us, right? And when we were closing and downsizing a lot of the unproductive square footage, we were able to leverage very easily, even on negative comps on some years, but that is all behind us now. What is happening now is the international stores actually are a big headwind because as a percent to sales, they are a higher percent to sales. Now within their country every year, we are trying to get them to leverage, but from a mix perspective, they hurt the overall ROD profile. So where we sit today is it takes sort of a low single-digit comp to leverage ROD."

I want to spend some time on where we are and where the industry is strategically and what we're doing. You'll recall that over a year ago, I spoke to you very directly about the fact that we were not where we needed to be in terms of product across our brands and how we need to bring product to market. And we have done a great deal of work across the company over the last 12-months-plus to be focused on product, focused on restoring the aesthetic of our brands, quality where it's appropriate, consistent fit and a number of elements of product, including building responsive product capabilities. I am pleased with the work. It is the right work and we will scale this work progressively period over period as we go forward. But clearly, we need to do more faster. And so with that, we've announced several other things that we're going to be taking on with a high degree of urgency. This is an environment that we're operating in today that demands faster change. We are present today with our global footprint where apparel dollars are being spent. That said, that is never meant that we will compete in every geography with every brand and every channel. And I'm a strong believer in company of trying things, learning from them, making adjustments and moving forward and doing that with the speed and doing that decisively. As part of this, we have announced that we will be winding down our Old Navy operations in Japan, partly due to the macro factors in that environment and partly due to, frankly, needing to apply the resources to greater and higher potential opportunities. I'm obviously disappointed that we're going to be discontinuing operations, but I view it as a sign of a good company when you acknowledge that the business isn't going to deliver and you make changes and move forward. I am so, with respect to Old Navy, very bullish about its global growth opportunity, very excited about the potential that lies in front of that. China has been and will continue to be a key area of focus for the entire company. And so far, in Mexico, I've been very pleased with what I've seen as the growth potential and profitability potential there as well. I'd also want to call out the fact that part of the work that we're doing right now is making sure that we're taking every opportunity to exploit our scale and our mass and our size. We believe very strongly that we have a structural advantage in our North American footprint. There are other advantages in North America that I want to make sure that we're fully exploiting, whether these our supply chain, logistics, our mobile and web presence, our CRM opportunity, all coupled with our product engine, which I believe form a potent formula for winning in North America. There's a tremendous CRM opportunity here. And when I say CRM, I really mean the opportunity to know our customers holistically and increasingly communicate with them as individuals and personalize their experience. We also have an opportunity, if I go back to mobile for a second, to move towards truly leveraging mobile traffic that we're getting on our website and continue to get towards a fully responsive, deep integrated, super efficient mobile web experience. These are all advantages in our core North America market we have, we can see them, we can exploit them, but we haven't pushed fully down that path. They are not unrepresented in other markets as well but with our home market being North America, they're powerful in terms of where we have a structural advantage. 
So I want to highlight 2 words and I've mentioned these now frequently inside the company and I just want to underline them for this conversation. Once acceleration and the other is distortion. They're both critically important. One is about moving faster on a broader front, and the other is about aligning our energy against fewer things deeper and better. Acceleration is about the change that we've already been embarking on as a company, but pushing harder and pushing faster. We have an opportunity to tighten up our operating model, to accelerate that change in order to be more nimble, to operate faster and to be more efficient at the same time. And I intend that we will take advantage of every opportunity there as well and accelerate the change that we're making. I also use the word distort and what it means to me is to make sure that our energy, our resources, our investments, our talent, our push towards places where we can win, where we can create advantage that is meaningful in our economics and advantages for our customers and win. So what's a good example of that? Our presence in active today. It's a big business for us. We're one of the largest players in active in North America today and it's an opportunity to continue to build the business, to participate in the highest growth segment of the apparel space and to then bring our scale, our mass and our capabilities to bear in technical innovation, in fabrication, in design and in trend, bring those to bear, not just in our active business, but on behalf of our entire ready-to-wear portfolio. 
Let me come back to Q1. Top line and bottom line, unacceptable. We saw traffic volatility over the course of several weeks during the first quarter and it obviously had a significant impact on demand, on promotional levels and on top line and bottom line. What I am very encouraged about is what we are seeing inside the business and the customers' reaction to the product work that we've been doing over the course over the last year. Going to a Gap store, look at the product and feel the quality, see the color, the optimism, their consistent fit, really proud of the work that the team has done and our customers are responding to it. But I started this a year ago and said that if we don't win at product first, we won't win. And it's clear that we need to do more than product, but I'm very pleased with the product work that we have done, and again, how it is showing up in front of our stores. You heard me speak to Old Navy before, too much fashion, too much duplication in the assortment. The most important thing to know about Old Navy is the brand proposition, the value proposition is compelling. I'm very excited about the team getting the brand back on track. I have 0 doubts about how compelling the value proposition is. 
Let me speak briefly about Banana for just a moment. Obviously, again, very disappointing complement business and we have more work to do to make sure that all of the product in the stores is being brought into the stores through the filters that the brand has put in place. That said, on key item buys, where we have been relentless about quality fit and making sure that it honors the promise of versatility that Banana has always honored, I'm seeing some very encouraging results there. Last, I have not spoken to you much about Athleta, but I will be remiss not to call out the fact that Athleta continues to perform superbly for us, that it is positioned wet in the sweet spot of the Active space, which is growing faster than the overall rate of apparel and it's a place where we are fundamentally omni-channel in our structure and very innovative all the way down to the fiber and fabric level in terms of product fabrications. And so both as a growth driver in this company, but also as a source of innovation to the rest of our portfolio. I couldn't be happier having Athleta as part of the The Gap, Inc. family. Let me close by saying that again, to me, the change that is impacting this industry is obvious. It's been obvious to us for a while, which is why we're moving with urgency against a multiyear plan to modernize this company across many levels. I'm very excited about what this company can do going forward. Thank you, and let me now hand off to Sabrina."

As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets where we believe we are structurally advantaged and/or where there's significant runway for growth. The",952,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets where we believe we are structurally advantaged and/or where there's significant runway for growth. The decisions we disclosed today will allow us to better align our talent and financial resources against our most important priorities. First, we've made the decision to wind down our Old Navy business in Japan by the end of fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are planning to close a number of dilutive Banana Republic stores primarily internationally. Further, we are taking steps to streamline our operating model. 
Let me give you some detail. Regarding Old Navy. As a reminder, we launched Old Navy Japan in 2012, and have 53 stores. While Japan will continue to be an important market for the company with over 200 Gap and Banana Republic specialty and outlet stores remaining, the investment in terms of both financial and human capital to build a new brand in that market is significant. Given the lack of growth in the apparel market there, we've decided this level of investment was imprudent. In the near term, Old Navy's growth ambition will be anchored in North America including our newest market, Mexico, as well as China and the franchise business. These opportunities present significant potential for us. With regard to streamlining our operating model, we have an opportunity to become more nimble and better leverage our scale. This will allow us to deliver the continued expense discipline you have come to expect from us and mitigate the natural upward momentum in SG&A. Together, we expect these decisions to result in annualized savings of about $275 million and operating margin improvement of nearly 2 percentage points. It's important to note that we expect an annualized sales loss of about $250 million from the closure of approximately 75 stores. We estimate restructuring cost of about $300 million, of which, about $100 million is estimated to be noncash. 
Now let me go back and speak to the results for the first quarter. While we're disappointed with our first quarter performance, it's important to note we've maintained our operating discipline in the areas we can control, as evidenced by continued expense management ending inventory in line with our guidance and delivering positive free cash flow. With regard to sales, sales totaled $3.4 billion, comp sales were down 5%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by about $20 million. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Moving to gross margin, first quarter gross profit totaled $1.2 billion and gross margin contracted 260 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were down 170 basis points driven by Old Navy and Banana Republic went in occupancy financial deleverage-ed 90 basis points. Regarding SG&A, first quarter total operating expenses were $987 million, slightly below last year. Marketing expenses were down about $9 million versus last year to $127 million. Operating income for the first quarter was $222 million and net earnings were $127 million. Earnings per share were $0.32. Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, total inventory were down about 3% at the end of the first quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter to be down in the low single-digits year-over-year. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of about $30 million and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $139 million. Square footage was down 1.3% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, we're operating in an evolving apparel retail environment and it's unclear whether the trends in Q1 will play forward for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are not reaffirming our 2016 guidance. For now, we believe the current first call consensus EPS estimate of $1.92 falls within a reasonable range of potential outcomes, excluding the restructuring charges I outlined earlier. To be clear, the Q1 trend would mean to improve in order to achieve this consensus estimate. If the Q1 trend continues, this will present downward pressure on the estimate. Regarding other guidance metrics. Our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have been and continue to be strength of our business model. We intend to maintain that focus and, therefore, we are reducing our 2016 capital spend guidance by about 20% or $125 million to about $525 million. We now expect depreciation and amortization of about $550 million. Regarding square footage, we now expect to end the year down 2%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of about flat. It's important to note we continue to have a diversified portfolio with the majority of our fleet either in the value segment or in growth markets and only about a quarter of the fleet in traditional North America Gap and Banana Republic specialty stores. 
Regarding tax, due to the fact that the restructuring charges necessitate certain noncash valuation allowances that impact our effective tax rate, we now believe the rates for the full year on continuing operations will be about 40%. In closing, our global growth strategy remains intact. We are simply focusing our talents and capital are areas that have the greatest potential for profitability. After our actions, we will still have a presence in over 90 countries. While we're disappointed with the results for the quarter, we're energized about our plans to evolved our business and to capitalize on the competitive advantages we have. Thank you, and I now turn it back over to Jack."

Several of those that was bundled together. It was a very clever. If we'd just think about promotion I think it depends on the brand because we're in very different positions on each brand, Gap and Banana having come out of situations where they were extremely deep over the course of the last, in some cases, 18 to 24 months because of big product issues. And in both of those businesses, we are working to drive top line, but also to tighten up our discounts. And if you are a subscriber to our e-mails and in our stores or on our website you will notice that it is real, it is not easy, but we are working in terms of the depth of promtional -- the depth of promotions, the promotional frequency and a breadth that they cover. And actually, I was just with the Gap team where we went through looking at our commercial plan up to Memorial Day and how we're trying to drive very compelling seasonally appropriate message from a promotional standpoint so that we can play, but also working to protect margin as much as we can. Same is really true on Banana where we have backed off, and I will be the first to say that when you start tightening up in promotion, you are playing a game of chicken with your customers and they try to wake you out and so we've been playing that now for really the last quarter. And we've seen more effects quite honestly, so it will be easier in Gap where we're seeing the numbers move more consistently in the right direction and a little more sporadically inside the Banana. Yes, Old Navy, we have been promotional, we are promotional. We had -- we missed execution in Q1 from a marketing standpoint, and we are really tightening up the commercial messaging for Q2 and Q3, but we are going to continue to be promotional there. It's the way you have to play in the value space. And I think us is that over the last few years, we have actually been quite good and pleased with the fact that we have improved our yields in managing the underlying promotions, while at the same time communicate the strong value message. I think we have something like an Athleta, which event is a smaller, but everyday a larger piece of the portfolio. It is still largely covered red price business and a business to be really feel good about from a standpoint of the promotional cadence there. On tickets, absolutely. It's something we've been looking at back in some cases, both in Banana and Gap and Old Navy as well, all 3, we have made some adjustments to our tickets where we felt like the initial tickets given very competitive optimal pricing was just were not real at the end of the day and that's something that we're always looking at. On Amazon, I'll reiterate exactly what I said regardless of how it got interpreted and that is that we are committed to making sure that we are our customers are. And today, our customers have obviously moved in digital very significantly to a mobile experience, and we are running, as quickly as we can, to make sure that we run alongside them every day. Amazon's presence in e-commerce is undeniable in this country, and therefore, to not fully consider all the options of distribution, for us would be to not be thinking about things that are important to us. So no way while I'm previewing a partnership, I'm just previewing the fact that we want to make sure that we're very situationally aware of what is going on around this with our customers and in the world."

Old Navy really started to soften for us in Q4. And that was right around the time, as you'll recall, we also had a leadership departure and an interim leader. We got in there very quickly. We looked and diagnosed the problem. By",675,"Yes. Let's talk Old Navy. Old Navy really started to soften for us in Q4. And that was right around the time, as you'll recall, we also had a leadership departure and an interim leader. We got in there very quickly. We looked and diagnosed the problem. By then, Q1 was bought so we had an assortment architecture that we had. And again, the issue there is not as much less about product acceptance and much more about the architecture of the assortment. And frankly, duplicative and over-assortment largely in the women's business. Items that were bought for a very short fashion vice or collections orientation and we lacked the depth and tightness a round key item buys in Old Navy. And so on diagnosing that, that's obviously come through Q1. As we have said before, focused on making changes as quickly as possible in Q2, which was coming out is pretty quickly. And I feel much better where we are in Q3 in the reset of the assortment architecture. I don't want to mention the fact that we have not had strong marketing in the first quarter of the year, and that has contributed to what has been an unacceptably soft Old Navy business, when I believe value continues to remain strong. And so it's deeply disappointing to me. We pulled TV out of April. We had an ineffective TV. TV is a big brand driver for Old Navy, and we're back on that as we look into Q2 and then certainly into Q3 and line up for back-to-school. And so I'm not going to call everything right as we crossed over the threshold into Q3, but I'm confident that we had the proper diagnosis, we took the proper actions. We've realigned the commercial plan and the overall macro trends for our value competitor, family value competitor for Old Navy should be strong. If I pivoted Banana for just a second, again, where I see us having put the most intention on key item buys to the filters of the brand, I'm pleased with what I'm saying. It is just too little, not fast enough. And so in this, the customer's responding to those, it validates the work that the team has been doing and then I go to the words that I've been using of accelerating the change to get there as quickly as possible. And that's a period-over-period change that we have confidence is going to continue to improve the business. Banana is the toughest product business that we have just given the segment that they're in and the work there has been the hardest work to reestablish, the aesthetic and invite the consumer back in. Leading-edge metrics in Banana around customer feedback, around reviews and things like that are very positive but we're not anywhere close to where we need to be as fast as we need to be there. If I go to Gap, here's what I would say about Gap. If the traffic volatility that we and the industry have not experienced, that hadn't happened in Q1, we will be sitting here having a very different and much more upbeat conversation. The metrics underneath the covers are moving in the right way. When we're in a mode like this, we track period-over-period leading-edge metrics and tyr all moving in the right direction for Gap, but we had traffic volatility that made it very difficult to show the top line that we are looking for here. So it's a mix story across the businesses. And again, just want to come back to Atlanta strong strength to the portfolio. I mention that in my comments and I want to underline that as well. We have a big business in Athleta for this company and it's a place we are pushing hard to continue sort towards that space and as we look at business, highest growing and it will be a very significant segment of the overall ready-to-wear apparel space as we go forward, and we plan on being here to stay."

You get about nearly 2 percentage points of operating margin accretion. So it's actually quite powerful from an operating margin perspective. So we're very pleased with that. This is going to be a journey back. So this is a big step forward in focusing us on the businesses that have the highest potential for long-term profitability and removing those that had quite a dilutive impact.

Again, like I said earlier, we saw what we saw in Q4 and going to be of the end again, that was coincident with the change in management and leadership transition. We made modest changes to Q1 as we previously indicated because most of that product was either here or on the way. And so we did have a limited amount of impact. And then incremental changes in Q2 as well and the ability to significantly affect Q3 and obviously,wholly affect Q4. And so from the standpoint of the assortment architecture, which again, was really largely around women's product being over assorted and lacking in the appropriate variety across some of the key programs and then lacking the inventory depth behind key buys, that is significantly corrected as we get into Q3. At the same time, we've had marketing against some weaker marketing against some strong marketing that we've had in the previous year and we work to correct that. We put TV and a number of other things back into the schedule in order to bring our voice back every day. And so do I believe that we're going to continue to see weakness in the business on a going forward consistently? I don't, because the value proposition again is in the sweet spot of where we should be playing right now. I am much more confident that the architecture of the assortment is back in line in Q3. And then Q4, I think we're in a very good shape and we have a very strong marketing program decked against it."

Surely, you're aware obviously since we have spent a lot of time talking about the back end that we're doing, the back-end work we're doing on supply chain, and that's work that is again, a journey, not a destination. I see significant scaling of that as we go forward in the businesses period over period. But it's, again, a journey that we're on at the end of day. If I look at some of the other areas, let's go to CRM for a second. It's what I'm really passionate about. I just announced a position in the company of a chief customer officer where we're taking a wide variety of disparate connections that we have with our customer and stitching them together organizationally and beginning to really build the capability to have a much more consistent, deep and holistic view of our customers as individuals. Core of that, as you might imagine, is our credit card, which our best customers. It's a program that we only have in the United States, which is part of why I go to structural strength. It's a very strong program here for us in the United States and it represents a significant portion of our business. And I'm not of a mind that an organizational change brings about meaningful change, but we have had bits and pieces of the customer against, in the number of places in the company and I just broken those walls down and brought it together. And if I think about what our best practices are broadly, we are well behind that. I think we're actually in a pretty good space from where our best practices are in the apparel industry and I'm looking to accelerate that significantly there also. And again, credit card is the core. Web browsing history, obviously, all your tender history, loyalty program, multi-tender loyalty program, all coming together in one place. And that's one example. And again, I'm not going to tell you that's let's on moment in Q3 or Q4 or something like that. We live in a world today where we spent a great deal of money on marketing, something else that I've signaled to you before and a lot of that money is spent in very traditional ways. And we are now increasingly enabling the capability to be much more one-on-one in our communication targeted and personalized in our communication, and that's a pivotal way from some of the traditional vehicles that we've seen to a much deeper form of communication to CRM. I had my board this week and I explained to them one of the places this will manifest itself is I think Windows today are much less relevant than they've historically been and you'll see this going forward that we're actually skinning down our Windows treatment in Gap as an example on the belief that if you haven't won in the digital interphase on the front end it, your windows in the mall stores are probably not quick to make a difference at the end of the day. So this is work that is underway. Again, I'm happy of course as always, is off to separately, but it's worth it were enthusiastic about that we believe we would we literally have some structural advantages."

And we see it obviously as everybody does, I think, a long-term progressive shift the consumer will be in that direction. Let the go straight to mobile for a second, but let me do sort of what I call the leaky bucket. If you think about business moving from stores to a desktop or laptop to mobile, stores for the industry, conversion of traffic into stores, whether it's in the mid-20s to the high 30s or something like that. If you go down to a desktop or laptop experience where someone spying, that traffic converts somewhere in the low single-digits from those people out there. And that if you go to a mobile experience, a lot of people out there today are seeing conversion off of mobile traffic is a fractional single digit. And so the work that we're doing is very much about addressing that migration of traffic and making sure that the opportunity for us to advertise that tap traffic as it moves remain severe at the end of the day. And so if I go straight to mobile, big part of mobile is making sure that people have an incredibly easy shopping experience and checkout experience on the mobile device. That the content is relevant so it means a responsive website, which were largely towards us even right now. And then obviously content and additional experience that shows up on a screen that's 2.5 by 5 inches at the end of the day. So that's something that we're very focused, for us, overall, our traffic is grown and it's grown with Digital. If I were a retailer out there, who is looking at this and see my traffic being directly substituted for my stores to a desktop to a laptop to a mobile device, I would really start to worry about that bucket leaking out of the business. And so we're committed to making sure where our customers is in our customer today and inclusive these on a mobile device, which means a great mobile shopping brand and e-commerce experience.

I want to spend some time on where we are and where the industry is strategically and what we're doing. You'll recall that over a year ago, I spoke to you very directly about the fact that we were not where we needed to be in terms of product across our brands and how we need to bring product to market. And we have done a great deal of work across the company over the last 12-months-plus to be focused on product, focused on restoring the aesthetic of our brands, quality where it's appropriate, consistent fit and a number of elements of product, including building responsive product capabilities. 
I am pleased with the work. It is the right work and we will scale this work progressively period over period as we go forward. But clearly, we need to do more faster. And so with that, we've announced several other things that we're going to be taking on with a high degree of urgency. This is an environment that we're operating in today that demands faster change. We are present today with our global footprint where apparel dollars are being spent. That said, that is never meant that we will compete in every geography with every brand and every channel. And I'm a strong believer in this company of trying things, learning from them, making adjustments and moving forward and doing that with speed and doing that decisively. 
As part of this, we have announced that we will be winding down our Old Navy operations in Japan, partly due to the macro factors in that environment and partly due to, frankly, needing to apply the resources to greater and higher potential opportunities. I'm obviously disappointed that we're going to be discontinuing operations, but I view it as a sign of a good company when you acknowledge that the business isn't going to deliver and you make changes and move forward. 
I am so, with respect to Old Navy, very bullish about its global growth opportunity, very excited about the potential that lies in front of that. China has been and will continue to be a key area of focus for the entire company. And so far, in Mexico, I've been very pleased with what I've seen as the growth potential and profitability potential there as well. I'd also want to call out the fact that part of the work that we're doing right now is making sure that we're taking every opportunity to exploit our scale and our mass and our size. We believe very strongly that we have a structural advantage in our North American footprint. There are other advantages in North America that I want to make sure that we're fully exploiting, whether these our supply chain, logistics, our mobile and web presence, our CRM opportunity, all coupled with our product engine, which I believe form a potent formula for winning in North America. There's a tremendous CRM opportunity here. And when I say CRM, I really mean the opportunity to know our customers holistically and increasingly communicate with them as individuals and personalize their experience. We also have an opportunity, if I go back to mobile for a second, to move towards truly leveraging mobile traffic that we're getting on our website and continue to get towards a fully responsive, deep integrated, super-efficient mobile web experience. These are all advantages that in our core North America market we have, we can see them, we can exploit them, but we haven't pushed fully down that path. They are not unrepresented in other markets as well but with our home market being North America, they're powerful in terms of where we have structural advantage. 
So I want to highlight 2 words and I've mentioned these now frequently inside the company and I just want to underline them for this conversation. Once acceleration and the other is distortion. They're both critically important. One is about moving faster on a broader front, and the other is about aligning our energy against fewer things deeper and better. Acceleration is about the change that we've already been embarking on as a company, but pushing harder and pushing faster. We have an opportunity to tighten up our operating model, to accelerate that change in order to be more nimble, to operate faster and to be more efficient at the same time. And I intend that we will take advantage of every opportunity there as well and accelerate the change that we're making. 
I also use the word distort and what it means to me is to make sure that our energy, our resources, our investments, our talent are push towards places where we can win, where we can create advantage that is meaningful in our economics and advantages for our customers and win. So what's a good example of that? Our presence in Active today. It's a big business for us. We're one of the largest players in Active in North America today and it's an opportunity to continue to build the business, to participate in the highest growth segment of the apparel space and to then bring our scale, our mass and our capabilities to bear in technical innovation, in fabrication, in design and in trend, bring those to bear, not just in our active business, but on behalf of our entire ready-to-wear portfolio. 
Let me come back to Q1. Top line and bottom line, unacceptable. We saw traffic volatility over the course of several weeks during the first quarter and it obviously had a significant impact on demand, on promotional levels and on top line and bottom line. What I am very encouraged about is what we are seeing inside the business and the customers' reaction to the product work that we've been doing over the course of last year. Going to a Gap store, look at the product, feel the quality, see the color, the optimism, the consistent fit, really proud of the work that the team has done and our customers are responding to it. But I started this a year ago and said, if we don't win at product first, we won't win. And it's clear that we need to do more than product, but I'm very pleased with the product work that we have done, and again, how it is showing up in front of our stores. You heard me speak to Old Navy before, too much fashion, too much duplication in the assortment. The most important thing to know about Old Navy is the brand proposition, the value proposition is compelling. I'm very excited about the team getting the brand back on track. I have 0 doubts about how compelling the value proposition is. 
Let me speak briefly about Banana for just a moment. Obviously, again, very disappointing comp in that business, and we have more work to do to make sure that all of the product in the stores is being brought into the stores through the filters that the brand has put in place. That said, on key item buys, where we have been relentless about quality fit and making sure that it honors the promise of versatility that Banana has always honored, I'm seeing some very encouraging results there. Last, I have not spoken to you much about Athleta, but I will be remiss not to call out the fact that Athleta continues to perform superbly for us, that it is positioned right in the sweet spot of the Active space, which is growing faster than the overall rate of apparel and it's a place where we are fundamentally omni-channel on our structure and very innovative all the way down to the fiber and fabric level in terms of product fabrications. And so both as a growth driver in this company, but also as a source of innovation to the rest of our portfolio. I couldn't be happier having Athleta as part of The Gap, Inc. family. 
Let me close by saying that, again, to me, the change that is impacting this industry is obvious. It's been obvious to us for a while, which is why we are moving with urgency against a multiyear plan to modernize this company across many levels. I'm very excited about what this company can do going forward. Thank you, and let me now hand off to Sabrina."

As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets where we believe we are structurally advantaged and/or where there's significant runway for growth. The",951,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets where we believe we are structurally advantaged and/or where there's significant runway for growth. The decisions we disclosed today will allow us to better align our talent and financial resources against our most important priorities. 
First, we've made the decision to wind down our Old Navy business in Japan by the end of fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are planning to close a number of dilutive Banana Republic stores, primarily internationally. Further, we are taking steps to streamline our operating model. 
Let me give you some detail. Regarding Old Navy. As a reminder, we launched Old Navy Japan in 2012, and have 53 stores. While Japan will continue to be an important market for the company with over 200 Gap and Banana Republic specialty and outlet stores remaining, the investment in terms of both financial and human capital to build a new brand in that market is significant. Given the lack of growth in the apparel market there, we've decided this level of investment was imprudent. In the near term, Old Navy's growth ambition will be anchored in North America including our newest market, Mexico, as well as China and the franchise business. These opportunities present significant potential for us. With regard to streamlining our operating model, we have an opportunity to become more nimble and better leverage our scale. This will allow us to deliver the continued expense discipline you have come to expect from us and mitigate the natural upward momentum in SG&A. Together, we expect these decisions to result in annualized savings of about $275 million and operating margin improvement of nearly 2 percentage points. It's important to note that we expect an annualized sales loss of about $250 million from the closure of approximately 75 stores. We estimate restructuring costs of about $300 million, of which, about $100 million is estimated to be noncash. 
Now let me go back and speak to the results for the first quarter. While we're disappointed with our first quarter performance, it's important to note we've maintained our operating discipline in the areas we can control, as evidenced by continued expense management, ending inventory in line with our guidance and delivering positive free cash flow. With regard to sales, sales totaled $3.4 billion, comp sales were down 5%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by about $20 million. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Moving to gross margin, first quarter gross profit totaled $1.2 billion and gross margin contracted 260 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were down 170 basis points driven by Old Navy and Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 90 basis points. 
Regarding SG&A, first quarter total operating expenses were $987 million, slightly below last year. Marketing expenses were down about $9 million versus last year to $127 million. Operating income for the first quarter was $222 million and net earnings were $127 million. Earnings per share were $0.32. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the first quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter to be down in the low single digits year-over-year. 
For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of about $30 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $139 million. Square footage was down 1.3% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, we're operating in an evolving apparel retail environment and it's unclear whether the trends in Q1 will play forward for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are not reaffirming our 2016 guidance. For now, we believe the current first call consensus EPS estimate of $1.92 falls within a reasonable range of potential outcomes, excluding the restructuring charges I outlined earlier. 
To be clear, the Q1 trend would mean to improve in order to achieve this consensus estimate. If the Q1 trend continues, this would present downward pressure on the estimate. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. Our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have been and continue to be strength of our business model. We intend to maintain that focus and, therefore, we are reducing our 2016 capital spend guidance by about 20% or $125 million to about $525 million. We now expect depreciation and amortization of about $550 million. 
Regarding square footage, we now expect to end the year down 2%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of about flat. It's important to note we continue to have a diversified portfolio with the majority of our fleet either in the value segment or in growth markets and only about a quarter of the fleet in traditional North America Gap and Banana Republic specialty stores. 
Regarding tax, due to the fact that the restructuring charges necessitate certain noncash valuation allowances that impact our effective tax rate, we now believe the rates for the full year on continuing operations will be about 40%. In closing, our global growth strategy remains intact. We are simply focusing our talents and capital on areas that have the greatest potential for profitability. After our actions, we will still have a presence in over 90 countries. While we're disappointed with the results for the quarter, we're energized about our plans to evolve our business and to capitalize on the competitive advantages we have. Thank you, and I'll turn it back over to Jack."

But we didn't expect deeply negative traffic and the other interesting thing about the trend was it was quite erratic. So we know that February started quite well and even March started quite well and it fell off precipitously in the week before Easter. So I think we just want to pause for a minute and see if the Q1 volatility is a continuing trend or an aberration for us and that will allow us to get a better sense of the full year and the assumptions we want to base that on.

Several of those bundled together. That was very clever. If we just think about promotion, I think it depends on the brand because we're in very different positions on each brand, Gap and Banana having come out of",638,"Sure. Let me try to address all of those. Several of those bundled together. That was very clever. If we just think about promotion, I think it depends on the brand because we're in very different positions on each brand, Gap and Banana having come out of situations where they were extremely deep over the course of the last, in some cases, 18 to 24 months because of big product issues. And in both of those businesses, we are working to drive top line, but also to tighten up our discounts. And if you are a subscriber to our e-mails or in our stores or on our website you will notice that it is real, it is not easy, but we are working in terms of the depth of promotional -- the depth of promotions, the promotional frequency and the breadth that they cover. And actually, I was just with the Gap team where we went through looking at our commercial plan up to Memorial Day and how we're trying to drive a very compelling seasonally appropriate message from a promotional standpoint so that we can play, but also working to protect margin as much as we can. Same is really true on Banana where we have backed off, and I will be the first to say that when you start tightening up in promotion, you are playing a game of chicken with your customers and they try to wait you out and so we've been playing that now for really the last quarter. And we've seen more effects from this quite honestly, so a little bit easier in Gap where we're seeing the numbers move more consistently in the right direction, a little more sporadically inside the Banana. Yes, at Old Navy, we have been promotional, we are promotional. We had -- we missed execution in Q1 from a marketing standpoint, and we are really tightening up the commercial messaging for Q2 and Q3, but we are going to continue to be promotional there. It's the way you have to play in the value space. And I think as we've said over the last few years, we have actually been quite good and pleased with the fact that we have improved our yields in managing the underlying promotions, while at the same time communicate the strong value message. And then you have something like an Athleta, which admittedly is a smaller but every day larger piece of the portfolio. It is still largely a reg price business and a business that we really feel good about from a standpoint of the promotional cadence there. On tickets, absolutely. It's something we've been looking at back in some cases, both in Banana and Gap and Old Navy as well, all 3, we have made some adjustments to our tickets where we felt like the initial tickets, given where our competitive out-the-door pricing was just were not real at the end of the day, and that's something that we're always looking at. On Amazon, I'll reiterate exactly what I said regardless of how it got interpreted and that is that we are committed to making sure that we are where our customers are. And today, our customers have obviously moved in digital very significantly to a mobile experience, and we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we run alongside them every day. Amazon's presence in e-commerce is undeniable in this country, and therefore, to not fully consider all the options of distribution, for us would be to not be thinking about things that were important to us. So in no way I'm previewing a partnership, I'm just previewing the fact that we want to make sure that we're very situationally aware of what is going on around this with our customers and in the world."

And that was right around the time, as you'll recall, we also had a leadership departure and an interim leader. We got in there very quickly. We looked and diagnosed the problem. By then, Q1 was bought so we had the assortment architecture that we had. And again, the issue there is not as much less about product acceptance and much more about the architecture of the assortment. And frankly, duplicative and over-assortment largely in the women's business. Items that were bought for a very short fashion buys are collections orientation and we lacked the depth and tightness around key item buys in Old Navy. And so on diagnosing that, that's obviously come through Q1. As we have said before, focused on making changes as quickly as possible in Q2, which was coming at as pretty quickly. And I feel much better where we are in Q3 in the reset of the assortment architecture. I don't want to leave on [ph] mentioning the fact that we have not had strong marketing in the first quarter of the year, and that has contributed to what has been an unacceptably soft Old Navy business, when I believe value continues to remain strong. And so it's deeply disappointing to me. We pulled TV out of April. We had an ineffective TV. TV is a big brand driver for Old Navy, and we're back on that as we look into Q2 and then certainly into Q3 and line up for back-to-school. And so I'm not going to call everything right as we crossed over the threshold into Q3, but I'm confident that we had the proper diagnosis, we took the proper actions. We've realigned the commercial plan and the overall macro trends for a value competitor, family value competitor for Old Navy should be strong. If I pivoted Banana for just a second, again, where I see us having put the most intention on key item buys to the filters of the brand, I'm pleased with what I'm seeing. It is just too little, not fast enough. And so in this, the customer's responding to those, it validates the work that the team has been doing and then I go to the words that I've been using of accelerating the change to get there as quickly as possible. And that's a period-over-period change that we have confidence is going to continue to improve the business. Banana is the toughest product business that we have just given the segment that they're in and the work there has been the hardest work to reestablish, the aesthetic and invite the consumer back in. Leading-edge metrics in Banana around customer feedback, around reviews and things like that are very positive, but we're not anywhere close to where we need to be as fast as we need to be there. If I go to Gap, here's what I would say about Gap. If the traffic volatility that we and the industry have not -- we experienced, if that had not happened in Q1, we will be sitting here having a very different and much more upbeat conversation. The metrics underneath the covers are moving in the right way. When we're in a mode like this, we track period-over-period leading-edge metrics and they're all moving in the right direction for Gap, but we had traffic volatility that made it very difficult to show the top line that we are looking for. So it's a mix story across the businesses. And again, I just want to come back to Athleta, strong strength to the portfolio. I mention that in my comments and I want to underline that as well. We have a big business in Active for this company, and it's a place where we are pushing hard to continue to distort [ph] towards that space. As we look at that business, highest growing and it will be a very significant segment of the overall ready-to-wear apparel space as we go forward, and we plan on being here to stay."

You get about nearly 2 percentage points of operating margin accretion. So it's actually quite powerful from an operating margin perspective. So we're very pleased with that. This is going to be a journey back. So this is a big step forward in focusing us on the businesses that have the highest potential for long-term profitability and removing those that had quite a dilutive impact.

And again, that was coincident with the change in management and leadership transition. We made modest changes to Q1 as we previously indicated because most of that product was either here or on the way. And so we did have a limited amount of impact. And then incremental changes in Q2 as well and the ability to significantly affect Q3 and obviously, wholly affect Q4. And so from the standpoint of the assortment architecture, which again, was really largely around women's product being over assorted and lacking in the appropriate variety across some of the key programs and then lacking the inventory depth behind key buys, that is significantly corrected as we get into Q3. At the same time, we've had marketing against some -- weaker marketing against some strong marketing that we've had in the previous year and we've worked to correct that. We put TV and a number of other things back into the schedule in order to bring our voice back every day. And so do I believe that we're going to continue to see weakness in the business on a going forward consistently? I don't, because the value proposition, again, is in the sweet spot of where we should be playing right now. I am much more confident that the architecture of the assortment is back in line in Q3. And then Q4, I think we're in a very good shape and we have a very strong marketing program decked against it."

Surely, you're aware obviously since we have spent a lot of time talking about the back end that we're doing, the back-end work we're doing on supply chain, and that's work that is, again, a journey, not a destination. I see significant scaling of that as we go forward in the businesses period-over-period. But it's, again, a journey that we're on at the end of day. If I look at some of the other areas, let's go to CRM for a second. It's what I'm really passionate about. I just announced a position in the company of a Chief Customer Officer where we are taking a wide variety of disparate connections that we have with our customer and stitching them together organizationally and beginning to really build the capability to have a much more consistent, deep and holistic view of our customers as individuals. The core of that, as you might imagine, is our credit card, which are our best customers. It's a program that we only have in the United States, which is part of why I go to structural strength. It's a very strong program here for us in the United States and it represents a significant portion of our business. And I'm not of a mind that an organizational change brings about meaningful change, but we have had bits and pieces of the customer, again, in a number of places in the company and I just broken those walls down and brought it together. And if I think about what our best practices are broadly, we are well behind that. I think we're actually in a pretty good space from where our best practices are in the apparel industry, and I'm looking to accelerate that significantly there also. And again, credit card is the core. Web browsing history, obviously, all your tender history, loyalty program, multi-tender loyalty program, all coming together in one place. And that's one example. And again, I'm not going to tell you that's a lights on moment in Q3 or Q4 or something like that. We live in a world today where we spent a great deal of money on marketing, something else that I've signaled to you before and a lot of that money is spent in very traditional ways. And we are now increasingly enabling the capability to be much more one-on-one in our communication targeted and personalized in our communication, and that's a pivotal way from some of the traditional vehicles that we've seen to a much deeper form of communication to CRM. I had my board this week, and I explained to them that one of the places where this will manifest itself is, I think, Windows today are much less relevant than they've historically been. And you'll see this going forward that we're actually skinning [ph] down our Windows treatment in Gap as an example on the belief that if you haven't won at the digital interface on the front end, your Windows in the mall stores are probably not going to make a difference at the end of the day. So this is work that's underway. Again, I'm happy of course, as always, to talk to you separately, but it's work that we're enthusiastic about where we believe we really truly have some structural advantages."

And we see it obviously as everybody does, I think, a long-term progressive shift that the consumer will be in that direction. Let me go straight to mobile for a second, but let me do the sort of what I call the leaky bucket. If you think about business moving from stores to a desktop or laptop to mobile, stores for the industry, conversion of traffic into stores, whether it's in the mid-20s to the high 30s or something like that. If you go down to a desktop or laptop experience where someone's buying, that traffic converts somewhere in the low single digits from those people out there. And then if you go to a mobile experience, a lot of people out there today are seeing conversion off of mobile traffic as a fractional single digit. And so the work that we're doing is very much about addressing that migration of traffic and making sure that the opportunity for us to monetize that traffic, as it moves, remains there at the end of the day. And so if I go straight to mobile, big part of mobile is making sure that people have an incredibly easy shopping experience and checkout experience on the mobile device. That the content is relevant so that means a responsive website, which were largely towards achieving right now. And then obviously content and the digital experience that shows up on a screen that's 2.5 by 5 inches at the end of the day. So that's something where we're very focused, for us. Overall, our traffic has grown and it's grown with digital. If I were a retailer out there, who was looking at this and was seeing my traffic being directly substituted for my stores to a desktop to a laptop to a mobile device, I would really start to worry about that bucket leaking out of the business. And so we're committed to making sure where our customers is and our customer today and increasingly is on a mobile device, which means a great mobile shopping brand and e-commerce experience.

I want to spend some time on where we are and where the industry is strategically and what we're doing.

I want to spend some time on where we are and where the industry is strategically and what we're doing. You'll recall that over a year ago, I spoke to you very directly about the fact that we were not where we needed to be in terms of products across our brands and how we need to bring product to market. And we have done a great deal of work across the company over the last 12-months-plus to be focused on product, focused on restoring the aesthetic of our brands, quality where it is appropriate, consistent fit and a number of elements of product, including building responsive product capabilities. 
I am pleased with the work. It is the right work and we will scale this work progressively period over period as we go forward. But clearly, we need to do more faster. And so with that, we've announced several other things that we're going to be taking on with a high degree of urgency. This is an environment that we're operating in today that demands faster change. We are present today with our global footprint where apparel dollars are being spent. That said, that has never meant that we will compete in every geography with every brand and every channel. And I'm a strong believer in this company of trying things, learning from them, making adjustments and moving forward and doing that with speed and doing that decisively. 
As part of this, we have announced that we will be winding down our Old Navy operations in Japan, partly due to the macro factors in that environment and partly due to, frankly, needing to apply the resources to greater and higher potential opportunities. I'm obviously disappointed that we're going to be discontinuing operations, but I view it as a sign of a good company when you acknowledge that the business isn't going to deliver and you make changes and move forward. 
I am so, with respect to Old Navy, very bullish about its global growth opportunity, very excited about the potential that lies in front of that. China has been and will continue to be a key area of focus for the entire company. And so far, in Mexico, I've been very pleased with what I've seen as the growth potential and profitability potential there as well. 
I'd also want to call out the fact that part of the work that we're doing right now is making sure that we're taking every opportunity to exploit our scale and our mass and our size. We believe very strongly that we have a structural advantage in our North American footprint. There are other advantages in North America that I want to make sure that we're fully exploring, whether these our supply chain, logistics, our mobile and web presence, our CRM opportunity, all coupled with our product engine, which I believe form a potent formula for winning in North America. There's a tremendous CRM opportunity here. And when I say CRM, I really mean the opportunity to know our customers holistically and increasingly communicate with them as individuals and personalize their experience. 
We also have an opportunity, if I go back to mobile for a second, to move towards truly leveraging mobile traffic that we're getting on our website and continue to get towards a fully responsive, deep integrated, super-efficient mobile web experience. These are all advantages that in our core North America market we have, we can see them, we can exploit them, but we haven't pushed fully down that path. They are not unrepresented in other markets as well, but with our home market being North America, they're powerful in terms of where we have structural advantage. 
So I want to highlight 2 words and I've mentioned these now frequently inside the company and I just want to underline them for this conversation. One is acceleration and the other is distortion. They're both critically important. One is about moving faster on a broader front, and the other is about aligning our energy against fewer things deeper and better. Acceleration is about the change that we've already been embarking on as a company, but pushing harder and pushing faster. We have an opportunity to tighten up our operating model, to accelerate that change in order to be more nimble, to operate faster and to be more efficient at the same time. And I intend that we will take advantage of every opportunity there as well and accelerate the change that we're making. 
I also use the word distort and what it means to me is to make sure that our energy, our resources, our investments, our talent are push towards places where we can win, where we can create advantage that is meaningful in our economics and advantageous for our customers and win. 
So what's a good example of that? Our presence in Active today. It's a big business for us. We're one of the largest players in Active in North America today and it's an opportunity to continue to build the business, to participate in the highest growth segment of the apparel space and to then bring our scale, our mass and our capabilities to bear in technical innovation, in fabrication, in design and in trend, bring those to bear, not just in our Active business, but on behalf of our entire ready-to-wear portfolio. 
Let me come back to Q1. Top line and bottom line, unacceptable. We saw traffic volatility over the course of several weeks during the first quarter and it obviously had a significant impact on demand, on promotional levels and on top line and bottom line. What I am very encouraged about is what we are seeing inside the business and the customers' reaction to the product work that we've been doing over the course of last year. Go into to a Gap store, look at the product, feel the quality, see the color, the optimism, the consistent fit, really proud of the work that the team has done and our customers are responding to it. But I started this a year ago and said, if we don't win at product first, we won't win. And it's clear that we need to do more than product, but I'm very pleased with the product work that we have done, and again, how it is showing up in front of our stores. 
You've heard me speak to Old Navy before, too much fashion, too much duplication in the assortment. The most important thing to know about Old Navy is the brand proposition. The value proposition is compelling. I'm very excited about the team getting the brand back on track. I have 0 doubts about how compelling the value proposition is. 
Let me speak briefly about Banana for just a moment. Obviously, again, very disappointing comp in that business, and we have more work to do to make sure that all of the product in the stores is being brought into the stores through the filters that the brand has put in place. That said, on key item buys, where we have been relentless about quality fit and making sure that it honors the promise of versatility that Banana has always honored, I'm seeing some very encouraging results there. 
Last, I have not spoken to you much about Athleta, but I will be remiss not to call out the fact that Athleta continues to perform superbly for us, that it is positioned right in the sweet spot of the Active space, which is growing faster than the overall rate of apparel, and it's a place where we are fundamentally omni-channel on our structure and very innovative all the way down to the fiber and fabric level in terms of product fabrications. And so both as a growth driver in this company, but also as a source of innovation to the rest of our portfolio, I couldn't be happier having Athleta as part of The Gap, Inc. family. 
Let me close by saying that, again, to me, the change that is impacting this industry is obvious. It's been obvious to us for a while, which is why we are moving with urgency against a multiyear plan to modernize this company across many levels. I'm very excited about what this company can do going forward. 
Thank you, and let me now hand off to Sabrina."

T",951,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets where we believe we are structurally advantaged and/or where there's significant runway for growth. 
The decisions we disclose today will allow us to better align our talent and financial resources against our most important priorities. First, we've made the decision to wind down our Old Navy business in Japan by the end of fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are planning to close a number of dilutive Banana Republic stores, primarily internationally. Further, we are taking steps to streamline our operating model. 
Let me give you some detail. Regarding Old Navy. As a reminder, we launched Old Navy Japan in 2012, and have 53 stores. While Japan will continue to be an important market for the company with over 200 Gap and Banana Republic specialty and outlet stores remaining, the investment in terms of both financial and human capital to build a new brand in that market is significant. Given the lack of growth in the apparel market there, we've decided this level of investment wasn't prudent. 
In the near term, Old Navy's growth ambitions will be anchored in North America including our newest market, Mexico, as well as China and the franchise business. These opportunities present significant potential for us. 
With regard to streamlining our operating model, we have an opportunity to become more nimble and better leverage our scale. This will allow us to deliver the continued expense discipline you have come to expect from us and mitigate the natural upward momentum in SG&A. 
Together, we expect these decisions to result in annualized savings of about $275 million and operating margin improvement of nearly 2 percentage points. It's important to note that we expect an annualized sales loss of about $250 million from the closure of approximately 75 stores. We estimate restructuring costs of about $300 million, of which, about $100 million is estimated to be noncash. 
Now, let me go back and speak to the results for the first quarter. While we're disappointed with our first quarter performance, it's important to note we've maintained our operating discipline in the areas we can control, as evidenced by continued expense management, ending inventory in line with our guidance and delivering positive free cash flow. With regard to sales, sales totaled $3.4 billion, comp sales were down 5%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by about $20 million. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross profit totaled $1.2 billion and gross margin contracted 260 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were down 170 basis points driven by Old Navy and Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 90 basis points. 
Regarding SG&A. First quarter total operating expenses were $987 million, slightly below last year. Marketing expenses were down about $9 million versus last year to $127 million. Operating income for the first quarter was $222 million and net earnings were $127 million. Earnings per share were $0.32. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the first quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter to be down in the low single digits year-over-year. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of about $30 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $139 million. Square footage was down 1.3% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. We're operating in an evolving apparel retail environment and it's unclear whether the trends in Q1 will play forward for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are not reaffirming our 2016 guidance. For now, we believe the current first call consensus EPS estimate of $1.92 falls within a reasonable range of potential outcomes, excluding the restructuring charges I outlined earlier. 
To be clear, the Q1 trend would need to improve in order to achieve this consensus estimate. If the Q1 trend continues, this would present downward pressure on the estimate. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. Our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have been and continue to be strengths of our business model. We intend to maintain that focus and, therefore, we are reducing our 2016 capital spend guidance by about 20% or $125 million to about $525 million. We now expect depreciation and amortization of about $550 million. 
Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 2%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of about flat. It's important to note we continue to have a diversified portfolio, with the majority of our fleet either in the value segment or in growth markets, and only about 1/4 of the fleet in traditional North America Gap and Banana Republic specialty stores. 
Regarding tax. Due to the fact that the restructuring charges necessitate certain noncash valuation allowances that impact our effective tax rate, we now believe the rate for the full year on continuing operations will be about 40%. 
In closing, our global growth strategy remains intact. We are simply focusing our talents and capital on areas that have the greatest potential for profitability. After our actions, we will still have a presence in over 90 countries. 
While we're disappointed with the results for the quarter, we're energized about our plans to evolve our business and to capitalize on the competitive advantages we have. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

Let me try to address all of those. Several of those bundled together; that was very clever. If we just think about promotion, I think it depends on the brand because we're in very different positions on each brand, Gap and Banana having come out of situations where they were extremely deep over the course of the last, in some cases, 18 to 24 months because of big product issues. And in both of those businesses, we are working to drive top line, but also to tighten up our discounts. And if you are a subscriber to our e-mails or in our stores or on our website, you will notice that. It is real. It is not easy, but we are working in terms of the depth of promotional -- the depth of promotions, the promotional frequency and the breadth that they cover. And actually, I was just with the Gap team where we went through looking at our commercial plan up to Memorial Day and how we're trying to drive a very compelling seasonally appropriate message from a promotional standpoint so that we can play, but also working to protect margin as much as we can. Same is really true on Banana where we have backed off, and I will be the first to say that when you start tightening up on promotion, you are playing a game of chicken with your customers and they try to wait you out and so we've been playing that now for really the last quarter. And we've seen more effects from this quite honestly. It's a little bit easier in Gap where we're seeing the numbers move more consistently in the right direction; a little more sporadic inside the Banana. At Old Navy, we have been promotional, we are promotional. We have -- we missed execution in Q1 from a marketing standpoint, and we are really tightening up the commercial messaging for Q2 and Q3, but we are going to continue to be promotional there. It's the way you have to play in the value space. And I think as we've said over the last few years, we have actually been quite good and pleased with the fact that we have improved our yields in managing the underlying promotions, while at the same time communicated the strong value message. And then you have something like an Athleta, which admittedly is a smaller but every day larger piece of the portfolio. It is still largely a reg. price business and a business that we really feel good about from a standpoint of the promotional cadence there. On tickets, absolutely. It's something we've been looking at and, in fact, in some cases, both in Banana and Gap and Old Navy as well, all 3, we have made some adjustments to our tickets where we felt like the initial tickets, given where competitive out-the-door pricing was, just were not real at the end of the day, and that's something that we're always looking at. On Amazon, I'll reiterate exactly what I said regardless of how it got interpreted and that is that we are committed to making sure that we are where our customers are. And today, our customers have obviously moved in digital very significantly to a mobile experience, and we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we run alongside them every day. Amazon's presence in e-commerce is undeniable in this country, and therefore, to not fully consider all the options of distribution, for us would be to not be thinking about things that were important to us. So in no way was I previewing a partnership, I'm just previewing the fact that we want to make sure that we're very situationally aware of what is going on around us with our customers and in the world."

And that was right around the time, as you recall, we also had a leadership departure and an interim leader. We got in there very quickly. We looked and diagnosed the problem. By then, Q1 was bought so we had the assortment architecture that we had. And again, the issue there is not -- is much less about product acceptance and much more about the architecture of the assortment and frankly, duplicative and over-assortment largely in the women's business. Items that were bought for very short fashion buys, a collections orientation and we lacked the depth and tightness around key item buys in Old Navy. And so on diagnosing that, that's obviously come through Q1. We, as we have said before, focused on making changes as quickly as possible in Q2, which was coming at us pretty quickly. And I feel much better where we are in Q3 in the reset of the assortment architecture. I don't want to leave unmentioned the fact that we have not had strong marketing in the first quarter of the year, and that has contributed to what has been an unacceptably soft Old Navy business, when I believe value continues to remain strong. And so it's deeply disappointing to me. We pulled TV out of April. We had ineffective TV. TV is a big brand driver for Old Navy, and we're back on that as we look into Q2 and then certainly into Q3 and lineup for back-to-school. And so I'm not going to call everything right as we cross over the threshold into Q3, but I'm confident that we had the proper diagnosis, we took the proper actions. We've realigned the commercial plan and the overall macro trends for a value competitor, family value competitor for Old Navy should be strong. If I pivot to Banana for just a second, again, where I see us having put the most intention on key item buys through the filters of the brand, I'm pleased with what I'm seeing. It is just too little, not fast enough. And so in that the customer's responding to those, it validates the work that the team has been doing and then I go to the words that I've been using of accelerating the change to get there as quickly as possible. And that's a period-over-period change that we have confidence is going to continue to improve the business. Banana is the toughest product business that we have just given the segment that they're in, and the work there has been the hardest work to reestablish the aesthetic and invite the consumer back in. Leading-edge metrics in Banana around customer feedback, around reviews and things like that are very positive, but we're not anywhere close to where we need to be as fast as we need to be there. If I go to Gap, here's what I would say about Gap. If the traffic volatility that we and the industry had not experienced, if that had not happened in Q1, we will be sitting here having a very different and much more upbeat conversation. The metrics underneath the covers are moving in the right way. When we're in a mode like this, we track period-over-period leading-edge metrics and they're all moving in the right direction for Gap, but we had traffic volatility that made it very difficult to show the top line that we are looking for. So it's a mix story across the businesses. And again, I just want to come back to Athleta, strong strength to the portfolio. I mentioned that in my comments and I want to underline that as well. We have a big business in Active for this company, and it's a place where we are pushing hard to continue to distort towards that space. As we look at that business, highest growing and it will be a very significant segment of the overall ready-to-wear apparel space as we go forward, and we plan on being here to stay."

And then second question, on Old Navy, sorry to beat it to death again. But just wondering between macro and weather, I mean, how much could this fashion miss or over fashion really have impacted the quarter here?

And again, that was coincident with the change in management and leadership transition. We made modest changes to Q1 as we previously indicated because most of that product was either here or on the way. And so we did have a limited amount of impact. And then incremental changes in Q2 as well and the ability to significantly affect Q3 and obviously, wholly affect Q4. And so from the standpoint of the assortment architecture, which again, was really largely around women's product being over assorted and lacking in the appropriate variety across some of the key programs, and then lacking the inventory depth behind key buys, that is significantly corrected as we get into Q3. At the same time, we've had marketing against some -- weaker marketing against some strong marketing that we've had in the previous year and we've worked to correct that. We put TV and a number of other things back into the schedule in order to bring our voice back every day. And so do I believe that we're going to continue to see weakness in the business on a going forward consistently? I don't, because the value proposition, again, is in the sweet spot of where we should be playing right now. I am much more confident that the architecture of the assortment is back in line in Q3. And then Q4, I think we're in a very good shape and we have a very strong marketing program decked against it."

Surely, you're aware, obviously, since we have spent a lot of time talking about, about the back end that we're doing, the back-end work we're doing on supply chain, and that's work that is, again, a journey, not a destination. I see significant scaling of that as we go forward in the businesses period-over-period. But it's, again, a journey that we're on at the end of day. If I look at some of the other areas, let's go to CRM for a second. It's what I'm really passionate about. I just announced a position in the company of a Chief Customer Officer where we are taking a wide variety of disparate connections that we have with our customer and stitching them together organizationally and beginning to really build the capability to have a much more consistent, deep and holistic view of our customers as individuals. The core of that, as you might imagine, is our credit card, which are our best customers. It's a program that we only have in the United States, which is part of why I go to structural strength. It's a very strong program here for us in the United States and it represents a significant portion of our business. And I'm not of a mind that an organizational change brings about meaningful change, but we have had bits and pieces of the customer, again, in a number of places in the company and I just broken those walls down and brought it together. And if I think about where best practices are broadly, we are well behind that. I think we're actually in a pretty good space from where our best practices are in the apparel industry, and I'm looking to accelerate that significantly there also. And again, credit card is the core. Web browsing history, obviously, all your tender history, loyalty program, multi-tender loyalty program, all coming together in one place. And that's one example. And again, I'm not going to tell you that's a lights on moment in Q3 or Q4 or something like that. We live in a world today where we spend a great deal of money on marketing, something else that I've signaled to you before and a lot of that money is spent in very traditional ways. And we are now increasingly enabling the capability to be much more one-on-one in our communication, targeted and personalized in our communication, and that's a pivotal way from some of the traditional vehicles that we've seen to a much deeper form of communication through CRM. I had my board this week, and I explained to them that one of the places where this will manifest itself is, I think, windows today are much less relevant than they've historically been. And you'll see this going forward that we're actually skinny-ing down our windows treatment in Gap as an example on the belief that if you haven't won at the digital interface on the front end, your windows in the mall store are probably not going to make a difference at the end of the day. So this is work that's underway. I can -- again, I'm happy of course, as always, to talk to you separately, but it's work that we're enthusiastic about where we believe we really truly have some structural advantages."

And we see it, obviously, as everybody does I think; a long-term progressive shift of the consumer will be in that direction. Let me go straight to mobile for a second, but let me do the -- sort of what I call the leaky bucket. If you think about business moving from stores to a desktop or laptop to mobile, stores for the industry, conversion of traffic into stores, whether it's in the mid-20s to the high-30s or something like that. If you go down to a desktop or laptop experience where someone's buying, that traffic converts somewhere in the low single digits for most people out there. And then, if you go to a mobile experience, a lot of people out there today are seeing conversion off of mobile traffic as a fractional single digit. And so the work that we're doing is very much about addressing that migration of traffic and making sure that the opportunity for us to monetize that traffic, as it moves, remains there at the end of the day. And so if I go straight to mobile, a big part of mobile is making sure that people have an incredibly easy shopping experience and checkout experience on a mobile device; that the content is relevant so that means a responsive website, which we're largely towards achieving right now; and then, obviously, content and the digital experience that shows up on a screen that's 2.5 by 5 inches at the end of the day. And so that's something where we're very focused. For us, overall, our traffic has grown and it's grown with digital. If I were a retailer out there, who was looking at this and was seeing my traffic being directly substituted for my stores to a desktop to a laptop to a mobile device, I would really start to worry about that bucket leaking out of the business. And so we're committed to making sure where our customers is and our customer today and increasingly is on a mobile device, which means a great mobile shopping brand and e-commerce experience."

And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. 
So number 1 on my mind is the consumer environment. And let me really tease it apart. there's obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail. In apparel specifically, the environment remains challenging. And quite frankly, it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market. And just to remind everybody, we have a very robust value portfolio with our outlet channels and the Old Navy business. 
Number 2, the restructuring work that we announced several months ago. I'm very pleased that we've been decisive and we've taken action. And as you know, that includes some expense reduction and trimming some parts of the portfolio where we had businesses that we felt did not have the potential for long-term returns. We're not all the way through this and we've taken action in Japan, with the Old Navy fleet there. And as we mentioned, are making progress on tuning at to BR international fleet as well. 
The third thing on my mind is the product operating model. And we've obviously been talking to you quite a bit about this over the last several calls that we had. If you think about the work that we're doing, we've been very aggressively focused now for some time on the back end of our model. I'm really building responses supply-chain capabilities. And that's through all of the things that we discussed, public platforming, more test and respond, shorter lead times and shorter calendar. The front end of that model is demand-driven buying. And so we're doing work in both of those right now. And I want to be clear that this is about continuous improvement, continuously building and speeding up our capabilities. We have work to do still in the front end or demand-driven buying and both of these things will continue to evolve and advance in parallel. 
The last thing that's on my mind is Old Navy. We obviously diagnosed some of the issues that we had in the business in Q4. I think I said at that time that Old Navy would hit a bump in the road but the bump is going to be less deep and less long. I think the return to improved performance that we've seen at Old Navy is validation. It's validation that we can, once again, move the brand to a market share gaining position, validation of the operating model that has allowed us to respond quite quickly and improve the business quite quickly, validation in the fact that we have a solid team in place, and frankly, validation of the value proposition that our consumers sees in Old Navy. 
But again, those 4 things have been on my mind and I wanted to share them with you. 
Let me move to a brand by brand conversation for Q2, and I want to start with Banana Republic. Clearly, we're nowhere close to the performance that the brand is capable of nor what we expect and want to hold accountable for. The team and I are relentlessly focused on continuing to make improvement in the business. And under the covers, there are some proof points that the work that we're doing is the right work where we've restored quality, customers have responded to that. Where we bought deeper into key categories, customers have responded to that. But the results of that, obviously, are not significant enough to manifest themselves on the top line or the bottom line. So we have urgency and we have a lot more work to do. 
Now let me turn to the Gap Specialty business, extremely aggressive work that we're doing there, where Gap is following Old Navy's lead on demand-driven buying. And also, some pretty aggressive work on the restructuring as well to get the cost structure of that business in line. The work is deep and it centers around core processes in the business. That is work underway. Again, many points of validation for the work, but nowhere close to the results that we need to see. We have, and I am encouraged by this, some very good price acceptance going on inside the Gap Women's business as we have reestablished the aesthetic of the brand. We have a great Kids and Baby business, continues to be a franchise category and again, I'll talk about this a bit later, we have a Fit business which we believe is very well connected to the active lifestyle that we think has significant growth and upside potential. 
So when Gap gets it right and has quality, on trend, on brand merchandise, we have the authority to price and deliver value in a way that I'm confident the brand has but we haven't seen the brand be able to do for a while. 
I want to turn to Old Navy. Very pleased with the recovery of performance from Q4. We've diagnosed it. The team has come together around the fix. But again, we started to see the business pull out in Q2 as we made the changes to the product pipeline and the assortment. And I would like to believe, and I'm actually pretty confident, that we will see Old Navy deliver a very solid back half this year. 
The other thing that makes me very confident about it is the opportunity for growth in front of us. And we have opportunities to put Old Navy into markets that are underserved today. We have an opportunity for small store formats and the first one of those that will really test it will be coming online in the next several months. If you can deliver a holistic, fully assorted Old Navy brand experience in a box 8,000 square feet, it opens up a significant opportunity for us with that brand globally. 
Last, it just plays in the sweet spot of where the consumer is. The value sweet spot today, Old Navy is extraordinarily competitive for the price out the door and has incredible quality, which is a killer proposition for the consumer. 
And then let me close with Athleta. There's a lot to talk about with respect to the active space, that athleisure space. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity, not just for Athleta but for the company. We are one of the few, if not the only, large apparel company that has a very material enterprisewide active business. And obviously, a very large ready-to-wear portfolio. 
So first, excited about the growth prospects in Athleta and continue to be very pleased with its performance. Secondly, excited about the opportunity for active growth inside of Gap and Old Navy. It continues to be something that our customer responds to. She has made it part of the way she leads her life and now really the way her family leads their life. And so we have an excellent position in 3 brands and one of the highest growth segments of the apparel industry that shows continued and very good growth. Third, excited about the prospect to begin or accelerate technical innovation from the active space into ready-to-wear. One of the things that I was really pleased about this last weekend was, as I looked across our 3 brands, in men's denim, we now have a compelling and amazing stretch offering in all 3 brands. That's a direct lift from the active space and we're not stopping at denim, there's applicability of that fabrication plus other technical features in twill, in shorts, and those are just the beginning here. We see significant opportunity for accelerating technical innovation in ready-to-wear, whether its stain repellent, stretch, moisture management, et cetera, and it's something that we're moving towards embracing our businesses as well as organizationally, put some muscle behind. 
So let me close with where I started. I'm very pleased with the decisiveness and the action on the restructuring work that we've taken on. I'm pleased with the direction and the validation that we're starting to see of our operating model work. Again, both the back end of the supply chain and the demand-based buying work that we're doing. And I want to call out Old Navy for quickly returning to improved performance, which again, it's absolutely positioned to do, we've seen that show up now in Q2. This is a company that is incredibly well-positioned for long-term success. You've heard my strong conviction to make some very material changes to how we do business and come out the other side as a very strong retailer and a very strong apparel company. Thanks, and Sabrina, over to you."

For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter",613,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon everyone. While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter-over-quarter. Merchandise margins in the quarter were up versus last year, with positive average unit retail. And Old Navy, our largest brand, began to see signs of stabilization, with a 6-point improvement in comps versus Q1. Additionally, we maintained our operating discipline. Specifically, we managed inventories tightly, delivered strong free cash flow and continued to manage expenses prudently. 
With regard to second quarter performance. As anticipated, our reported results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with our previously announced restructuring plan. These costs totaled about $0.29 in earnings per share, of which about $0.07 related to a higher effective tax rate. The nontax related restructuring costs were about $150 million, with about $15 million hitting gross margin and about $135 million in SG&A. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.31. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. It's important to note that foreign exchange negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.05 or about 8 percentage points of EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Excluding restructuring cost in both periods and the impact from foreign exchange, our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year were up slightly. 
Regarding other key metrics. Sales totaled $3.85 billion. Comp sales were down 2% and total sales were down 1%. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Excluding restructuring cost from both periods, adjusted gross margin rate was about flat. It's worth noting that our merchandise margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year, or up about 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Additionally, both marketing expenses and adjusted total operating expense dollars were about flat year-over-year. Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 52.5%, the higher rate was driven by noncash valuation allowances related to our restructuring. Our adjusted effective tax rate was over 10 points lower. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the third quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. 
Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $460 million and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. As a reminder, we currently intend to repair $400 million term loan this year. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $270 million. Square footage was down 1% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. On our first quarter earnings call, we stated that full year earnings per share excluding restructuring costs of $1.92, fell within a reasonable range of outcomes, assuming trends improved. While we acknowledge that trends did improve, as we said on our sales call 2 weeks ago, performance was uneven throughout the quarter. Therefore, we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that incorporates the likelihood of inconsistent traffic. 
Excluding restructuring costs, we now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92 and operating margin to be about 8.5%. 
Regarding tax rate, we expect the rate for the full year will be about 44% or about 40%, excluding restructuring costs, in line with our guidance last quarter. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

The -- we've seen good product acceptance, in particular on our key fashion buys that we haven't bought deep enough. So if you're in our stores in July, you would've seen some really beautiful, well made, feminine brand right tops with islet and lace. They were in the stores gone in a heartbeat. Very much on trend, off the shoulder as well, some of those things. We are over assorted in some of our basics programs which is why in summer clearance, I called it a, just to sort of an array of color that was left, particularly in knits where we over assorted. And so it's about rebalancing the buys and having more confidence in some of the fashion places where we are now starting to see some of that validation. And we are also seeing really, the authority of the brand. I was in our flagship store in New York a few weeks ago and in San Francisco here yesterday. There's a suede program which the flagship program, which has prices from $200 to $450. And it's sold down to the piece. And it shows where, when we get it right with the authority, the brand is, from a pricing aperture standpoint as well. And again, I'd like a lot more depth behind those buys. And so we're learning here to get that confidence. On the cost structure, Gap's been our most complicated business in terms of geographies and channels and multiple locations. And so as we are rebuilding business processes, we are also further rationalizing some of the complexity and getting some more leverage out of the cost structure as well. We've had essentially two headquarters locations between San Francisco and New York. And then, different teams and different parts of the business. So we're just looking for efficiency every place we can in the overall cost structure."

It's a very -- it's a deep and large question, so I may not get you all the way to satisfaction. If I just use an example of beginning to build and stretch into men's world in fabrications. That is something that is really, partly our vendors and partly a direct port from some of our fabric R&D work and fabric and technical knowledge that we have inside of Athleta and then some of the work that we're doing in our businesses as well working with our vendors. And so I don't see it as, we are taking some organizational steps in order to concentrate our strength there and our knowledge in fabric R&D. I don't see this as driving any significant deviations from the standpoint of the cost of our products. And one of the advantages that we have is when we put our businesses together, we do have scale, we are buying very large quantities, we're working with our vendors as a large purchaser. And so if I look at Old Navy as an example where we built a great deal of stretch in the men's denim complex, it was a modest impact on product cost but not a huge impact on product cost and I'm really pleased that as we've continued to feather it in to the assortment, the incremental product cost has been overwhelmed by price realization. So we've seen he's actually willing to pay for and willing to pay more for. So to me, this is being careful. But so far, the validation that customers are willing to pay for technical innovation and ready-to-wear is very clear across all of our brands and across the entire family.

And it's a big deal for us. And then when we are at our best, we really kill it on fit. And she really appreciates that. But we've done too much wandering around the landscape over the last couple of years as we've tuned and tweaked fit and not have a consistent fit. It also, as you probably know, has an economic drag on the company, particularly on the online business because when you're in consistent on fit, she quickly learns that she's going to order a 2, a 4 and a 6, knowing that 4 is her size and then obviously figuring out which one fits and then sending the other 2 back or returning them to a store. And that has a drag of cost and devalue of merchandise associated with that as well. So fit has been a big issue for me. And we are seeing some progress and some response there. Next really is to bring the voice of the brand back and start telling the story. Because we have -- we increased marketing a little bit. We really pivoted it towards traffic and digital. But we have not been telling the story about the product and about the quality of the fit, et cetera, all the elements the store to the extent that we need to. So as we look at the back half, that's something that's very much on my mind.

So with regard to July, the difference really between June and July was the traffic dropped off significantly again for Banana and for Gap. We actually held traffic pretty well in July for Old Navy and that's why they have the better results of the 3 brands. Why it dropped off, we are still trying to work through. That's part of the reason that we are investing in marketing in Q3 because we're really focused on trying to change that inconsistency in trajectory. So that's the July deal. With regard to the portfolio and the state of the fleet, we are, as you know, been very proactive in trying to stay ahead and take action on optimizing the fleet, with big announcements last year on the Gap fleet and then another announcement in Q1 of this year, closing another 75 stores in addition to those 175. So we are always open to looking to opportunities to optimize the fleet, but also, I think, Art mentioned in his remarks, to look for opportunities to grow the fleet where appropriate. Now any growth in our future will certainly be focused around much tighter, smaller boxes. That is something we're very sensitive and hyperaware about is we just think we need to get much more productive within smaller boxes in our future."

The back end, which is vendor facing, length of our calendar, our fabric being platformed, strategic vendor relationships where they have capacity reserve and they can cut into us on the release of a PO. I'm really pleased with the extent to which we fill that capacity out. The reality right now is that we're constrained and full utilizing the back end at our front end processes, which is why I also threw in the work that we're doing on demand-based buying. And that's really, if you really want to think about what that is, it's just disaggregating what was a four season brand reveal, buy all at once, into a much more disaggregated average buying process. So we're working our way through that one right now. It is the constraint, the scaling this at an enterprise level and Gap brand is doing the heavy lifting on the front end right now on behalf of the other other parts of the company. So we have a ways to go there and it's really step-by-step.

So again, if you just start with where can we see this start to rollout, we are really pushing stretch in men's which we're finding the men's customer really responds to across multiple fabrications and multiple wearing occasions. So if you're in Old Navy today, there's a stretch Oxford shirt in there that is super comfortable. It really, it's like this precision fit. We're pushing stretch across, really, in men's, our two key bottoms fabrications in terms of denim and twill, in both shirts and long bottoms. And really, testing where else we can go with it because we believe that it's actually really revolutionizing in many respects. That's a big word. But how men dress and the comfort and fit they have in both tops and bottoms. So that's the step. We have nanotechnology in pants in Banana that will be basically not marketed at all, which is highly stain resistant. If you pour a cup of coffee on the pants, it beads up and runs off. And we find that he has responded to that. Right now, to be honest, we are more using pre-existing fiber and fabric innovation from our vendors. But we're also reorganizing order to be able to do work with some of our key vendors and be more proactive about driving innovation, which then, we believe, can unlock potentially, some proprietary benefits. And I don't want to get into it right now. It's a much longer conversation and it's early days. But we feel that our scale and our size, working as a $16 billion enterprise for the company has the potential to not just benefit from pre-existing innovation but drive innovation. And so that's exciting for us as well. And it's across a number of different dimensions, whether it's as I said, whether its heat management, whether it's stain resistance, whether it stretch and comfort, just to name a few right now that are out there."

So season over season, getting rebalanced for again, key item programs but also making sure that we had depth in some of these fashion buys. That's something that is going to get better every season. I was just again in storage yesterday and I saw Gap show up again with the first [indiscernible] and fall and you'll see that again with more depth in fashion as we get into September. So is a season over season process and one where we are actively learning and managing our buys as aggressively as we can. On denim, I've obviously tracking and reading all of the comments that have come out across the industry over the last several days and there's a bit of a bit of optimism about denim out there. We're obviously extraordinarily well positioned in the denim business across all of our businesses, Banana has a great denim business now as well, it's in front of the store. I'm not ready to say -- I'm always hopeful about denim and it's been in the trough for a long time. We are absolutely positioned to ride the rise of denim but I do want to get frothy about talking about the fact that denim is now on a massive upturn and everything else. I want to -- I'm much more in the mode of under promising and over deliver here. And I'm confident that denim is going to come back because it has been in kind of the malaise.

I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. So number one on my mind is the consumer environment.",1460,"Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon. I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. 
So number one on my mind is the consumer environment. And let me really tease it apart. There's obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail. In apparel specifically, the environment remains challenging. And quite frankly, it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market. And just to remind everybody, we have a very robust value portfolio with our outlet channels and the Old Navy business. 
Number two, the restructuring work that we announced several months ago. I'm very pleased that we've been decisive and we've taken action. And as you know, that includes some expense reduction and trimming some parts of the portfolio where we had businesses that we felt did not have the potential for long-term returns. We're not all the way through this, and we've taken action in Japan with the Old Navy fleet there, and as we mentioned, are making progress on tuning in the BR international fleet as well. 
The third thing on my mind is the product operating model. And we've obviously been talking to you quite a bit about this over the last several calls that we've had. If you think about the work that we're doing, we've been very aggressively focused now for some time on the back end of our model. I'm really building responses supply-chain capabilities. And that's through all the things that we've discussed, fabric public platforming, more test and respond, shorter lead times and shorter calendar. The front end of that model is demand-driven buying. And so we're doing work in both of those right now. And I want to be clear that this is about continuous improvement, continuously building and speeding up our capabilities. We have work to do still in the front end or demand-driven buying and both of these things will continue to evolve and advance in parallel. 
The last thing that's on my mind is Old Navy. We obviously diagnosed some of the issues that we had in the business in Q4. I think I said at that time that Old Navy would hit a bump in the road, but the bump was going to be less deep and less long. I think the return to improved performance that we've seen at Old Navy is validation. It's validation that we can, once again, move the brand to a market share gaining position, validation of the operating model that has allowed us to respond quite quickly and improve the business quite quickly, validation in the fact that we have a solid team in place, and frankly, validation of the value proposition that our consumer sees in Old Navy. 
But again, those 4 things have been on my mind and I wanted to share them with you. 
Let me move to a brand by brand conversation for Q2, and I want to start with Banana Republic. Clearly, nowhere close to the performance that the brand is capable of nor what we expect and want to hold it accountable for. The team and I are relentlessly focused on continuing to make improvement in the business. And under the covers, there are some proof points that the work that we're doing is the right work. Where we've restored quality, customers have responded to that. Where we bought deeper into key categories, customers have responded to that. But the results of that, obviously, are not significant enough to manifest themselves on the top line or the bottom line. So we have urgency, and we have a lot more work to do. 
Now let me turn to the Gap Specialty business. Extremely aggressive work that we're doing there, where Gap is following Old Navy's lead on demand-driven buying. And also, some pretty aggressive work on the restructuring as well to get the cost structure of that business in line. The work is deep, and it centers around core processes in the business. That is work underway. Again, many points of validation for the work, but nowhere close to the results that we need to see. We have, and I am encouraged by this, some very good price acceptance going on inside the Gap women's business as we have reestablished the aesthetic of the brand. We have a great kids and baby business, continues to be a franchise category and again, I'll talk about this a bit later, we have a Fit business which we believe is very well connected to the active lifestyle that we think has significant growth and upside potential. 
So when Gap gets it right and has quality, on trend, on brand merchandise, we have the authority to price and deliver value in a way that I'm confident the brand has, but we haven't seen the brand be able to do for a while. 
I want to turn to Old Navy. Very pleased with the recovery of performance from Q4. We've diagnosed it. The team has come together around the fix. But again, we started to see the business pull out in Q2 as we made the changes through the product pipeline and the assortment. And I would like to believe, and I'm actually pretty confident, that we will see Old Navy deliver a very solid back half this year. 
The other thing that makes me very confident about it is the opportunity for growth in front of us. And we have opportunities to put Old Navy into markets that are underserved today. We have an opportunity for small store formats, and the first one of those that will really test it will be coming online in the next several months. If you can deliver a holistic, fully assorted Old Navy brand experience in a box 8,000 square feet, it opens up a significant opportunity for us with that brand globally. 
Last, it just plays in the sweet spot of where the consumer is. The value sweet spot today, Old Navy is extraordinarily competitive for the price out the door and has incredible quality, which is a killer proposition for the consumer. 
And then let me close with Athleta. There's a lot talked about with respect to the active space, the athleisure space. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity, not just for Athleta but for the company. We are one of the few, if not the only, large apparel company that has a very material enterprise-wide active business. And obviously, a very large ready-to-wear portfolio. 
So first, excited about the growth prospects in Athleta and continue to be very pleased with its performance. Secondly, excited about the opportunity for active growth inside of Gap and Old Navy. It continues to be something that our customer responds to. She has made it part of the way she leads her life and now really the way her family leads their life. And so we have an excellent position in 3 brands in one of the highest growth segments of the apparel industry that shows continued and very good growth. Third, excited about the prospect to begin or accelerate technical innovation from the active space into ready-to-wear. One of the things that I was really pleased about this last weekend was, as I looked across our 3 brands, in men's denim, we now have a compelling and amazing stretch offering in all 3 brands. That's a direct lift from the active space, and we're not stopping at denim. There's applicability of that fabrication plus other technical features in twill, in shorts, and those are just the beginning here. We see significant opportunity for accelerating technical innovation in ready-to-wear, whether its stain repellent, stretch, moisture management, et cetera, and it's something that we're moving to both embracing our businesses as well as organizationally, put some muscle behind. 
So let me close with where I started. I'm very pleased with the decisiveness and the action on the restructuring work that we've taken on. I'm pleased with the direction and the validation that we're starting to see of our operating model work, again, both the back end of the supply chain and the demand-based buying work that we're doing. And I want to call out Old Navy for quickly returning to improved performance, which, again it's absolutely positioned to do. We've seen that show up now in Q2. This is a company that is incredibly well positioned for long-term success. You've heard my strong conviction to make some very material changes to how we do business and come out the other side as a very strong retailer and very strong apparel company. Thanks, and Sabrina, over to you."

While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends",615,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter-over-quarter. Merchandise margins in the quarter were up versus last year with positive average unit retail. And Old Navy, our largest brand, began to see signs of stabilization, with a 6-point improvement in comps versus Q1. Additionally, we maintained our operating discipline. Specifically, we managed inventories tightly, delivered strong free cash flow and continued to manage expenses prudently. 
With regard to second quarter performance, as anticipated, our reported results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with our previously announced restructuring plan. These costs totaled about $0.29 in earnings per share, of which about $0.07 related to a higher effective tax rate. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $150 million, with about $15 million hitting gross margin and about $135 million in SG&A. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.31. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. It's important to note that foreign exchange negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.05 or about 8 percentage points of EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Excluding restructuring cost in both periods and the impact from foreign exchange, our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year were up slightly. 
Regarding other key metrics. Sales totaled $3.85 billion. Comp sales were down 2% and total sales were down 1%. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Excluding restructuring costs from both periods, adjusted gross margin rate was about flat. It's worth noting that our merchandise margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year, or up about 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Additionally, both marketing expenses and adjusted total operating expense dollars were about flat year-over-year. Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 52.5%. The higher rate was driven by noncash valuation allowances related to our restructuring. Our adjusted effective tax rate was over 10 points lower. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the third quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of over $460 million and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. As a reminder, we currently intend to repair $400 million term loan this year. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $270 million. Square footage was down 1% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. On our first quarter earnings call, we stated that full year earnings per share excluding restructuring costs of $1.92, fell within a reasonable range of outcomes, assuming trends improved. While we acknowledge that trends did improve, as we said on our sales call 2 weeks ago, performance was uneven throughout the quarter. Therefore, we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that incorporates the likelihood of inconsistent traffic. 
Excluding restructuring costs, we now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92 and operating margin to be about 8.5%. 
Regarding tax rate, we expect the rate for the full year will be about 44% or about 40%, excluding restructuring costs, in line with our guidance last quarter. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

The -- we've seen good product acceptance, in particular on our key fashion buys that we haven't bought deep enough. So if you're in our stores in July, you would've seen some really beautiful, well made, feminine brand right tops with islet and lace. They were in the stores gone in a heartbeat. Very much on trend, off the shoulder as well, some of those things. We were over assorted in some of our basics programs which is why in summer clearance, I called it a -- just a sort of an array of color that was left, particularly in knits where we over assorted. And so it's about rebalancing the buys and having more confidence in some of the fashion places where we're now starting to see some of that validation. And we are also seeing really, the authority of the brand. I was in our flagship store in New York a few weeks ago and in San Francisco here yesterday. There's a [indiscernible] program which is a flagship program, which has prices from $200 to $450. And it's sold down to the piece. And it shows where, when we get it right with the authority, the brand is, from a pricing aperture standpoint as well. And again, I'd like a lot more depth behind those buys. And so we're learning here to get that confidence. On the cost structure, Gap's been our most complicated business in terms of geographies and channels and multiple locations. And so as we are rebuilding business processes, we are also further rationalizing some of the complexity and getting some more leverage out of the cost structure as well. We've had essentially two headquarters locations between San Francisco and New York, and then, different teams in different parts of the business. So we're just looking for efficiency every place we can in the overall cost structure."

And so I think it's a month and still got to fill itself out before we're really ready to say what it looks like. With respect to inventories, we are and always, I think, have been for a while very, very responsible on inventories and being very careful about how we buy to the traffic trend. And so we were aggressive on carry -- on our carryover in terms of summer clearance. We wanted to make sure that we moved as quickly as possible to get clean there. I'll let Sabrina jump in here as well, but I don't have acute concerns about our inventory levels right now."

That is something that is really, partly our vendors and partly a direct port from some of our fabric R&D work and fabric and technical knowledge that we have inside of Athleta and then some of the work that we're doing in our businesses as well working with our vendors. And so I don't see it as -- we are taking some organizational steps in order to concentrate our strength there and our knowledge in fabric R&D. I don't see this as driving any significant deviations from the standpoint of the cost of our products. And one of the advantages that we have is when we put our businesses together, we do have scale, we are buying very large quantities, we're working with our vendors as a large purchaser. And so if I look at Old Navy as an example where we built a great deal of stretch into the men's denim complex, it was a modest impact on product cost but not a huge impact on product cost. And I'm really pleased that as we've continued to feather it into the assortment, the incremental product cost has been overwhelmed by price realization. And so we've seen that he's actually willing to pay for and willing to pay more for it. So to me, this is being careful. But so far, the validation that customers are willing to pay for technical innovation in ready-to-wear is very clear across all of our brands and across the entire family.

And we have very encouraging metrics on all three of those that we, our customers, see us as expressing the brand appropriately and that they are responding to quality that they understand, recognize and value and our fit consistency has continued to improve and it's been a real focus on bottoms. And that's a big deal for us. And when we are at our best, we really kill it on fit. And she really appreciates that. But we've done too much wandering around the landscape over the last couple of years as we've tuned and tweaked fit and not had a consistent fit. It also, as you probably know, has an economic drag on the company, particularly in the online business because when you're inconsistent on fit, she quickly learns that she's going to order a 2, a 4 and a 6, knowing that 4 is her size and then obviously, figuring out which one fits and then sending the other 2 back or returning them to a store. And that has a drag of cost and devalue of merchandise associated with it as well. So fit has been a big issue for me. And we're seeing some progress and response there. Next really is to bring the voice of the brand back and start telling the story. Because we have -- we increased marketing a little bit. We really pivoted it towards traffic and digital. But we've not been telling the story about the product and about the quality of the fit, et cetera, all the elements of the story to the extent that we need to. And so as we look at the back half, that's something that's very much on my mind. As you can imagine, I mean, that's part of the story at Old Navy, is that we've continued to put marketing against the business and we've seen the consumer respond to it. But we've been relatively quiet at both Banana and Gap."

That's part of the reason that we are investing in marketing in Q3 because we're really focused on trying to change that inconsistency in trajectory. So that's the July deal. With regard to the portfolio and the state of the fleet, we are, as you know, been very proactive in trying to stay ahead and take action on optimizing the fleet, with big announcements last year on the Gap fleet and then another announcement in Q1 of this year, closing another 75 stores in addition to those 175. So we are always open to looking to opportunities to optimize the fleet, but also, I think, Art mentioned in his remarks, to look for opportunities to grow the fleet where appropriate. Now any growth in our future will certainly be focused around much tighter, smaller boxes. That is something we're very sensitive and hyperaware about is we just think we need to get much more productive within smaller boxes in our future."

I'm really pleased with the extent to which we've filled that capacity out. The reality right now is that we are constrained in fully utilizing the back end by our front-end processes, which is why I also threw in the work that we're doing on demand-based buying. And that's really, if you really want to think about what that is, it's disaggregating what was a 4-season brand reveal, buy all at once, into a much more disaggregated, de-averaged buying process. And so we're working our way through that one right now. It is the constraint to scaling this at an enterprise level and Gap brand is doing the heavy lifting on the front end right now on behalf of the other parts of the company. And so we have a ways to go there, and it's really step-by-step.

Again, if you just start with where can we see this start to roll out, we are really pushing stretch in men's, which we're finding the men's customer really responds to across multiple fabrications and multiple wearing occasions. So if you're in Old Navy today, there's a stretch Oxford shirt in there that is super comfortable. It really, it's like this precision fit. We're pushing stretch across, really, in men's, our 2 key bottoms fabrications in terms of denim and twill, in both shorts and long bottoms. And really, testing where else we can go with it because we believe that it's actually really revolutionizing in many respects, that's a big word, but how men dress and the comfort and fit that they have in both tops and bottoms. So that's a step. We have nanotechnology in pants in Banana that we have basically not marketed at all, which is highly stain-resistant. If you pour a cup of coffee on the pants, it beads up and runs off. And we find that he has responded to that. Right now, to be honest, we are more using pre-existing fiber and fabric innovation from our vendors. But we're also reorganizing in order to be able to do work with some of our key vendors and be more proactive about driving innovation, which then, we believe, can unlock potentially, some proprietary benefits. And I don't want to get into that right now. It's a much longer conversation and it's early days. But we feel that our scale and our size, working as a $16 billion enterprise for the company, has the potential to not just benefit from pre-existing innovation but drive innovation. And so that's exciting for us as well. And it's across a number of different dimensions, whether it's, as I said, whether it's heat management, whether it's stain resistance, whether it's stretch and comfort, just to name a few right now that are out there."

We were over assorted there. And so we are learning season over season, and we've made some changes even after we booked in order to tighten some of our programs up. So season over season, getting rebalanced for, again, key item programs but also making sure that we have depth in some of these fashion buys. That's something that is going to get better every season. I was just again in storage yesterday and I saw Gap show up again with the first full fall and you'll see that again with more depth in fashion as we get into September. So it's a season-over-season process and one where we're actively learning and managing our buys as aggressively as we can. On denim, I've obviously been tracking and reading all of the comments that have come out across the industry over the last several days, and there's a bit of  optimism about denim out there. We're obviously extraordinarily well positioned in the denim business across all of our businesses, Banana has a great denim business now as well, it's front of the store. I'm not ready to say -- I'm always hopeful about denim, and it's been in the trough for a long time. We are absolutely positioned to ride the rise of denim, but I don't want to get frothy about talking about the fact that denim is now on a massive upturn and everything else. I want to -- I'm much more in the mode of under-promising and trying to over-deliver here. And I'm confident denim is going to come back because it has been in kind of a malaise. But we are well positioned across all the bottoms fabrications, whether it's from an active fabrication, a buy stretch and a pant for a woman, a twill fabrication or denim, we're well-positioned to play wherever the market goes."

I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. So number one on my mind is the consumer environment.",1464,"Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon. I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. 
So number one on my mind is the consumer environment. And let me really tease it apart. There's obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail. In apparel specifically, the environment remains challenging. And quite frankly, it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market. And just to remind everybody, we have a very robust value portfolio with our outlet channels and the Old Navy business. 
Number two, the restructuring work that we announced several months ago. I'm very pleased that we've been decisive and we've taken action. And as you know, that includes some expense reduction and trimming some parts of the portfolio where we had businesses that we felt did not have the potential for long-term returns. We're not all the way through this, and we've taken action in Japan with the Old Navy fleet there, and as we mentioned, are making progress on tuning in the BR international fleet as well. 
The third thing on my mind is the product operating model. And we've obviously been talking to you quite a bit about this over the last several calls that we've had. If you think about the work that we're doing, we've been very aggressively focused now for some time on the back end of our model on really building responsive supply-chain capabilities. And that's through all the things that we've discussed, fabric public platforming, more test and respond, shorter lead times or shorter calendar. The front end of that model is demand-driven buying. And so we're doing work in both of those right now. And I want to be clear that this is about continuous improvement, continuously building and speeding up our capabilities. We have work to do still in the front end or demand-driven buying and both of these things will continue to evolve and advance in parallel. 
The last thing that's on my mind is Old Navy. We obviously diagnosed some of the issues that we had in the business in Q4. I think I said at that time that Old Navy would hit a bump in the road, but the bump was going to be less deep and less long. I think the return to improved performance that we've seen at Old Navy is validation. It's validation that we can, once again, move the brand to a market share gaining position, validation of the operating model that has allowed us to respond quite quickly and improve the business quite quickly, validation in the fact that we have a solid team in place, and frankly, validation of the value proposition that our consumer sees in Old Navy. 
But again, those 4 things have been on my mind and I wanted to share them with you. 
Let me move to a brand by brand conversation for Q2, and I want to start with Banana Republic. Clearly, nowhere close to the performance that the brand is capable of, nor what we expect and want to hold it accountable for. The team and I are relentlessly focused on continuing to make improvement in the business. And under the covers, there are some proof points that the work that we're doing is the right work. Where we've restored quality, customers have responded to that. Where we bought deeper into key categories, customers have responded to that. But the results of that, obviously, are not significant enough to manifest themselves on the top line or the bottom line. So we have urgency, and we have a lot more work to do. 
Now let me turn to the Gap Specialty business. Extremely aggressive work that we're doing there, where Gap is following Old Navy's lead on demand-driven buying. And also, some pretty aggressive work on the restructuring as well to get the cost structure of that business in line. The work is deep, and it centers around core processes in the business. That is work underway. Again, many points of validation for the work, but nowhere close to the results that we need to see. We have, and I am encouraged by this, some very good price [ph] acceptance going on inside the Gap women's business as we have reestablished the aesthetic of the brand. We have a great kids and baby business, continues to be a franchise category and again, I'll talk about this a bit later, we have a Fit business which we believe is very well connected to the active lifestyle that we think has significant growth and upside potential. 
So when Gap gets it right and has quality, on trend, on brand merchandise, we have the authority to price and deliver value in a way that I'm confident the brand has, but we haven't seen the brand be able to do for a while. 
I want to turn to Old Navy. Very pleased with the recovery of performance from Q4. We've diagnosed it. The team has come together around the fix. But again, we started to see the business pull out in Q2 as we made the changes through the product pipeline and the assortment. And I would like to believe, and I'm actually pretty confident, that we will see Old Navy deliver a very solid back half this year. 
The other thing that makes me very confident about it is the opportunity for growth in front of us. And we have opportunities to put Old Navy into markets that are underserved today. We have an opportunity for small store formats, and the first one of those that will really test it will be coming online in the next several months. If you can deliver a holistic, fully assorted Old Navy brand experience in a box 8,000 square feet, it opens up a significant opportunity for us with that brand globally. 
Last, it just plays in the sweet spot of where the consumer is. The value sweet spot today, Old Navy is extraordinarily competitive for the price out the door and has incredible quality, which is a killer proposition for the consumer. 
And then let me close with Athleta. There's a lot talked about with respect to the active space, the athleisure space. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity, not just for Athleta but for the company. We are one of the few, if not the only, large apparel company that has a very material enterprise-wide active business. And obviously, a very large ready-to-wear portfolio. 
So first, excited about the growth prospects in Athleta and continue to be very pleased with its performance. Secondly, excited about the opportunity for active growth inside of Gap and Old Navy. It continues to be something that our customer responds to. She has made it part of the way she leads her life and now really the way her family leads their life. And so we have an excellent position in 3 brands in one of the highest growth segments of the apparel industry that shows continued and very good growth. Third, excited about the prospect to begin or accelerate technical innovation from the active space into ready-to-wear. One of the things that I was really pleased about this last weekend was, as I looked across our 3 brands, in men's denim, we now have a compelling and amazing stretch offering in all 3 brands. That's a direct lift from the active space, and we're not stopping at denim. There's applicability of that fabrication plus other tactical (sic) [technical] features in twill, in shorts, and those are just the beginning here. We see significant opportunity for accelerating technical innovation in ready-to-wear, whether its stain repellent, stretch, moisture management, et cetera, and it's something that we're moving to both embrace in our businesses as well as organizationally, put some muscle behind. 
So let me close with where I started. I'm very pleased with the decisiveness and the action on the restructuring work that we've taken on. I'm pleased with the direction and the validation that we're starting to see of our operating model work, again, both the back end of the supply chain and the demand-based buying work that we're doing. And I want to call out Old Navy for quickly returning to improved performance, which, again it's absolutely positioned to do. We've seen that show up now in Q2. This is a company that is incredibly well positioned for long-term success. You've heard my strong conviction to make some very material changes to how we do business and come out the other side as a very strong retailer and very strong apparel company. Thanks, and Sabrina, over to you."

While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends",615,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter-over-quarter. Merchandise margins in the quarter were up versus last year with positive average unit retail. And Old Navy, our largest brand, began to see signs of stabilization, with a 6-point improvement in comps versus Q1. Additionally, we maintained our operating discipline. Specifically, we managed inventories tightly, delivered strong free cash flow and continued to manage expenses prudently. 
With regard to second quarter performance, as anticipated, our reported results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with our previously announced restructuring plan. These costs totaled about $0.29 in earnings per share, of which about $0.07 related to a higher effective tax rate. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $150 million, with about $15 million hitting gross margin and about $135 million in SG&A. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.31. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. It's important to note that foreign exchange negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.05 or about 8 percentage points of EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Excluding restructuring cost in both periods and the impact from foreign exchange, our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year were up slightly. 
Regarding other key metrics. Sales totaled $3.85 billion. Comp sales were down 2% and total sales were down 1%. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Excluding restructuring costs from both periods, adjusted gross margin rate was about flat. It's worth noting that our merchandise margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year, or up about 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Additionally, both marketing expenses and adjusted total operating expense dollars were about flat year-over-year. Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 52.5%. The higher rate was driven by noncash valuation allowances related to our restructuring. Our adjusted effective tax rate was over 10 points lower. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the third quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of over $460 million and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. As a reminder, we currently intend to repair $400 million term loan this year. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $270 million. Square footage was down 1% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. On our first quarter earnings call, we stated that full year earnings per share excluding restructuring costs of $1.92, fell within a reasonable range of outcomes, assuming trends improved. While we acknowledge that trends did improve, as we said on our sales call 2 weeks ago, performance was uneven throughout the quarter. Therefore, we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that incorporates the likelihood of inconsistent traffic. 
Excluding restructuring costs, we now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92 and operating margin to be about 8.5%. 
Regarding tax rate, we expect the rate for the full year will be about 44% or about 40%, excluding restructuring costs, in line with our guidance last quarter. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

The -- we've seen good product acceptance, in particular on our key fashion buys that we haven't bought deep enough. So if you were in our stores in July, you would've seen some really beautiful, well made, feminine brand right tops with islet and lace. They were in the stores gone in a heartbeat. Very much on trend, off the shoulder as well, some of those things. We were over-assorted in some of our basics programs which is why in summer clearance, I called it a -- just a sort of an array of color that was left, particularly in knits where we over-assorted. And so it's about rebalancing the buys and having more confidence in some of the fashion places where we're now starting to see some of that validation. And we are also seeing really, the authority of the brand. I was in our flagship store in New York a few weeks ago and in San Francisco here yesterday. There's a suede program which is a flagship program, which has prices from $200 to $450. And it's sold down to the piece. And it shows where, when we get it right with the authority of the brand is, from a pricing aperture standpoint as well. And again, I'd like a lot more depth behind those buys. And so we're learning here to get that confidence. On the cost structure, Gap's been our most complicated business in terms of geographies and channels and multiple locations. And so as we are rebuilding business processes, we are also further rationalizing some of the complexity and getting some more leverage out of the cost structure as well. We've had essentially two headquarters locations between San Francisco and New York, and then, different teams in different parts of the business. So we're just looking for efficiency every place we can in the overall cost structure."

With respect to inventories, we are and always, I think, have been for a while very, very responsible on inventories and being very careful about how we buy to the traffic trend. And so we were aggressive on carry -- on our carryover in terms of summer clearance. We wanted to make sure that we moved as quickly as possible to get clean there.

It's a very -- it's a deep and large question, so I may not get you all the way to satisfaction. If I just use an example of beginning to build and stretch into men's world in fabrications.

And so I don't see it as -- we are taking some organizational steps in order to concentrate our strength there and our knowledge in fabric R&D. I don't see this as driving any significant deviations from the standpoint of the cost of our products. And one of the advantages that we have is when we put our businesses together, we do have scale, we are buying very large quantities, we're working with our vendors as a large purchaser. And so if I look at Old Navy as an example where we built a great deal of stretch into the men's denim complex, it was a modest impact on product cost but not a huge impact on product cost. And I'm really pleased that as we've continued to feather it into the assortment, the incremental product cost has been overwhelmed by price realization. And so we've seen that he's actually willing to pay for and willing to pay more for it. So to me, this is being careful. But so far, the validation that customers are willing to pay for technical innovation in ready-to-wear is very clear across all of our brands and across the entire family.

And we have very encouraging metrics on all 3 of those that we, our customers, see us as expressing the brand appropriately and that they are responding to quality that they understand, recognize and value and our Fit consistency has continued to improve and it's been a real focus on bottoms. And that's a big deal for us. And when we are at our best, we really kill it on Fit. And she really appreciates that. But we've done too much wandering around the landscape over the last couple of years as we've tuned and tweaked fit and not had a consistent fit. It also, as you probably know, has an economic drag on the company, particularly in the online business because when you're inconsistent on Fit, she quickly learns that she's going to order a 2, a 4 and a 6, knowing that 4 is her size and then obviously, figuring out which one fits and then sending the other 2 back or returning them to a store. And that has a drag of cost and devalue of merchandise associated with it as well. So fit has been a big issue for me. And we're seeing some progress and response there. Next really is to bring the voice of the brand back and start telling the story. Because we have -- we increased marketing a little bit. We really pivoted it towards traffic and digital. But we've not been telling the story about the product and about the quality of the fit, et cetera, all the elements of the story to the extent that we need to. And so as we look at the back half, that's something that's very much on my mind. As you can imagine, I mean, that's part of the story at Old Navy, is that we've continued to put marketing against the business and we've seen the consumer respond to it.

That's part of the reason that we are investing in marketing in Q3 because we're really focused on trying to change that inconsistency in trajectory. So that's the July deal. With regard to the portfolio and the state of the fleet, we are, as you know, been very proactive in trying to stay ahead and take action on optimizing the fleet, with big announcements last year on the Gap fleet and then another announcement in Q1 of this year, closing another 75 stores in addition to those 175. So we are always open to looking to opportunities to optimize the fleet, but also, I think, Art mentioned in his remarks, to look for opportunities to grow the fleet where appropriate. Now any growth in our future will certainly be focused around much tighter, smaller boxes.

The back end, which is vendor facing, length of our calendar, our fabric being platformed, strategic vendor relationships where they have capacity reserve and they can cut into us on release of a PO. I'm really pleased with the extent to which we've filled that capacity out. The reality right now is that we are constrained in fully utilizing the back end by our front-end processes, which is why I also threw in the work that we're doing on demand-based buying. And that's really, if you really want to think about what that is, it's disaggregating what was a 4-season brand reveal, buy all at once, into a much more disaggregated, de-averaged buying process. And so we're working our way through that one right now. It is the constraint to scaling this at an enterprise level and Gap brand is doing the heavy lifting on the front end right now on behalf of the other parts of the company. And so we have a ways to go there, and it's really step-by-step.

Again, if you just start with where can we see this start to roll out, we are really pushing stretch in men's, which we're finding the men's customer really responds to across multiple fabrications and multiple wearing occasions. So if you're in Old Navy today, there's a stretch Oxford shirt in there that is super comfortable. It really, it's like this precision fit. We're pushing stretch across, really, in men's, our 2 key bottoms fabrications in terms of denim and twill, in both shorts and long bottoms. And really, testing where else we can go with it because we believe that it's actually really revolutionizing in many respects, that's a big word, but how men dress and the comfort and fit that they have in both tops and bottoms. So that's a step. We have nanotechnology in pants in Banana that we have basically not marketed at all, which is highly stain-resistant. If you pour a cup of coffee on the pants, it beads up and runs off. And we find that he has responded to that. Right now, to be honest, we are more using pre-existing fiber and fabric innovation from our vendors. But we're also reorganizing in order to be able to do work with some of our key vendors and be more proactive about driving innovation, which then, we believe, can unlock potentially, some proprietary benefits. And I don't want to get into that right now. It's a much longer conversation and it's early days. But we feel that our scale and our size, working as a $16 billion enterprise for the company, has the potential to not just benefit from pre-existing innovation but drive innovation. And so that's exciting for us as well. And it's across a number of different dimensions, whether it's, as I said, whether it's heat management, whether it's stain resistance, whether it's stretch and comfort, just to name a few right now that are out there."

We were over-assorted there. And so we are learning season over season, and we've made some changes even after we booked in order to tighten some of our programs up. So season over season, getting rebalanced for, again, key item programs but also making sure that we have depth in some of these fashion buys. That's something that is going to get better every season. I was just again in storage yesterday and I saw Gap show up again with the first full fall and you'll see that again with more depth in fashion as we get into September. So it's a season-over-season process and one where we're actively learning and managing our buys as aggressively as we can. On denim, I've obviously been tracking and reading all of the comments that have come out across the industry over the last several days, and there's a bit of optimism about denim out there. We're obviously extraordinarily well positioned in the denim business across all of our businesses, Banana has a great denim business now as well, it's front of the store. I'm not ready to say -- I'm always hopeful about denim, and it's been in the trough for a long time. We are absolutely positioned to ride the rise of denim, but I don't want to get frothy about talking about the fact that denim is now on a massive upturn and everything else.

I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. So number one on my mind is the consumer environment.",1464,"Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon. I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you. And really, they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2. 
So number one on my mind is the consumer environment. And let me really tease it apart. There's obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail. In apparel specifically, the environment remains challenging. And quite frankly, it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market. And just to remind everybody, we have a very robust value portfolio with our outlet channels and the Old Navy business. 
Number two, the restructuring work that we announced several months ago. I'm very pleased that we've been decisive and we've taken action. And as you know, that includes some expense reduction and trimming some parts of the portfolio where we had businesses that we felt did not have the potential for long-term returns. We're not all the way through this, and we've taken action in Japan with the Old Navy fleet there, and as we mentioned, are making progress on tuning in the BR international fleet as well. 
The third thing on my mind is the product operating model. And we've obviously been talking to you quite a bit about this over the last several calls that we've had. If you think about the work that we're doing, we've been very aggressively focused now for some time on the back end of our model on really building responsive supply-chain capabilities. And that's through all the things that we've discussed, fabric public platforming, more test and respond, shorter lead times or shorter calendar. The front end of that model is demand-driven buying. And so we're doing work in both of those right now. And I want to be clear that this is about continuous improvement, continuously building and speeding up our capabilities. We have work to do still in the front end or demand-driven buying and both of these things will continue to evolve and advance in parallel. 
The last thing that's on my mind is Old Navy. We obviously diagnosed some of the issues that we had in the business in Q4. I think I said at that time that Old Navy would hit a bump in the road, but the bump was going to be less deep and less long. I think the return to improved performance that we've seen at Old Navy is validation. It's validation that we can, once again, move the brand to a market share gaining position, validation of the operating model that has allowed us to respond quite quickly and improve the business quite quickly, validation in the fact that we have a solid team in place, and frankly, validation of the value proposition that our consumer sees in Old Navy. 
But again, those 4 things have been on my mind and I wanted to share them with you. 
Let me move to a brand by brand conversation for Q2, and I want to start with Banana Republic. Clearly, nowhere close to the performance that the brand is capable of, nor what we expect and want to hold it accountable for. The team and I are relentlessly focused on continuing to make improvement in the business. And under the covers, there are some proof points that the work that we're doing is the right work. Where we've restored quality, customers have responded to that. Where we bought deeper into key categories, customers have responded to that. But the results of that, obviously, are not significant enough to manifest themselves on the top line or the bottom line. So we have urgency, and we have a lot more work to do. 
Now let me turn to the Gap Specialty business. Extremely aggressive work that we're doing there, where Gap is following Old Navy's lead on demand-driven buying. And also, some pretty aggressive work on the restructuring as well to get the cost structure of that business in line. The work is deep, and it centers around core processes in the business. That is work underway. Again, many points of validation for the work, but nowhere close to the results that we need to see. We have, and I am encouraged by this, some very good price [ph] acceptance going on inside the Gap women's business as we have reestablished the aesthetic of the brand. We have a great kids and baby business, continues to be a franchise category and again, I'll talk about this a bit later, we have a Fit business which we believe is very well connected to the active lifestyle that we think has significant growth and upside potential. 
So when Gap gets it right and has quality, on trend, on brand merchandise, we have the authority to price and deliver value in a way that I'm confident the brand has, but we haven't seen the brand be able to do for a while. 
I want to turn to Old Navy. Very pleased with the recovery of performance from Q4. We've diagnosed it. The team has come together around the fix. But again, we started to see the business pull out in Q2 as we made the changes through the product pipeline and the assortment. And I would like to believe, and I'm actually pretty confident, that we will see Old Navy deliver a very solid back half this year. 
The other thing that makes me very confident about it is the opportunity for growth in front of us. And we have opportunities to put Old Navy into markets that are underserved today. We have an opportunity for small store formats, and the first one of those that will really test it will be coming online in the next several months. If you can deliver a holistic, fully assorted Old Navy brand experience in a box 8,000 square feet, it opens up a significant opportunity for us with that brand globally. 
Last, it just plays in the sweet spot of where the consumer is. The value sweet spot today, Old Navy is extraordinarily competitive for the price out the door and has incredible quality, which is a killer proposition for the consumer. 
And then let me close with Athleta. There's a lot talked about with respect to the active space, the athleisure space. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity, not just for Athleta but for the company. We are one of the few, if not the only, large apparel company that has a very material enterprise-wide active business. And obviously, a very large ready-to-wear portfolio. 
So first, excited about the growth prospects in Athleta and continue to be very pleased with its performance. Secondly, excited about the opportunity for active growth inside of Gap and Old Navy. It continues to be something that our customer responds to. She has made it part of the way she leads her life and now really the way her family leads their life. And so we have an excellent position in 3 brands in one of the highest growth segments of the apparel industry that shows continued and very good growth. Third, excited about the prospect to begin or accelerate technical innovation from the active space into ready-to-wear. One of the things that I was really pleased about this last weekend was, as I looked across our 3 brands, in men's denim, we now have a compelling and amazing stretch offering in all 3 brands. That's a direct lift from the active space, and we're not stopping at denim. There's applicability of that fabrication plus other tactical (sic) [technical] features in twill, in shorts, and those are just the beginning here. We see significant opportunity for accelerating technical innovation in ready-to-wear, whether its stain repellent, stretch, moisture management, et cetera, and it's something that we're moving to both embrace in our businesses as well as organizationally, put some muscle behind. 
So let me close with where I started. I'm very pleased with the decisiveness and the action on the restructuring work that we've taken on. I'm pleased with the direction and the validation that we're starting to see of our operating model work, again, both the back end of the supply chain and the demand-based buying work that we're doing. And I want to call out Old Navy for quickly returning to improved performance, which, again it's absolutely positioned to do. We've seen that show up now in Q2. This is a company that is incredibly well positioned for long-term success. You've heard my strong conviction to make some very material changes to how we do business and come out the other side as a very strong retailer and very strong apparel company. Thanks, and Sabrina, over to you."

While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends",615,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2. For example, comps and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter-over-quarter. Merchandise margins in the quarter were up versus last year with positive average unit retail. And Old Navy, our largest brand, began to see signs of stabilization, with a 6-point improvement in comps versus Q1. Additionally, we maintained our operating discipline. Specifically, we managed inventories tightly, delivered strong free cash flow and continued to manage expenses prudently. 
With regard to second quarter performance, as anticipated, our reported results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with our previously announced restructuring plan. These costs totaled about $0.29 in earnings per share, of which about $0.07 related to a higher effective tax rate. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $150 million, with about $15 million hitting gross margin and about $135 million in SG&A. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.31. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. It's important to note that foreign exchange negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.05 or about 8 percentage points of EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Excluding restructuring cost in both periods and the impact from foreign exchange, our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year were up slightly. 
Regarding other key metrics. Sales totaled $3.85 billion. Comp sales were down 2% and total sales were down 1%. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Excluding restructuring costs from both periods, adjusted gross margin rate was about flat. It's worth noting that our merchandise margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year, or up about 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Additionally, both marketing expenses and adjusted total operating expense dollars were about flat year-over-year. Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 52.5%. The higher rate was driven by noncash valuation allowances related to our restructuring. Our adjusted effective tax rate was over 10 points lower. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the third quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of over $460 million and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. As a reminder, we currently intend to repair $400 million term loan this year. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $270 million. Square footage was down 1% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release. 
With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. On our first quarter earnings call, we stated that full year earnings per share excluding restructuring costs of $1.92, fell within a reasonable range of outcomes, assuming trends improved. While we acknowledge that trends did improve, as we said on our sales call 2 weeks ago, performance was uneven throughout the quarter. Therefore, we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that incorporates the likelihood of inconsistent traffic. 
Excluding restructuring costs, we now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92 and operating margin to be about 8.5%. 
Regarding tax rate, we expect the rate for the full year will be about 44% or about 40%, excluding restructuring costs, in line with our guidance last quarter. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

The -- we've seen good product acceptance, in particular on our key fashion buys that we haven't bought deep enough. So if you were in our stores in July, you would've seen some really beautiful, well made, feminine brand right tops with islet and lace. They were in the stores gone in a heartbeat. Very much on trend, off the shoulder as well, some of those things. We were over-assorted in some of our basics programs which is why in summer clearance, I called it a -- just a sort of an array of color that was left, particularly in knits where we over-assorted. And so it's about rebalancing the buys and having more confidence in some of the fashion places where we're now starting to see some of that validation. And we are also seeing really, the authority of the brand. I was in our flagship store in New York a few weeks ago and in San Francisco here yesterday. There's a suede program which is a flagship program, which has prices from $200 to $450. And it's sold down to the piece. And it shows where, when we get it right with the authority of the brand is, from a pricing aperture standpoint as well. And again, I'd like a lot more depth behind those buys. And so we're learning here to get that confidence. On the cost structure, Gap's been our most complicated business in terms of geographies and channels and multiple locations. And so as we are rebuilding business processes, we are also further rationalizing some of the complexity and getting some more leverage out of the cost structure as well. We've had essentially two headquarters locations between San Francisco and New York, and then, different teams in different parts of the business. So we're just looking for efficiency every place we can in the overall cost structure."

And so I think it's a month and still got to fill itself out before we're really ready to say what it looks like. With respect to inventories, we are and always, I think, have been for a while very, very responsible on inventories and being very careful about how we buy to the traffic trend.

And one of the advantages that we have is when we put our businesses together, we do have scale, we are buying very large quantities, we're working with our vendors as a large purchaser. And so if I look at Old Navy as an example where we built a great deal of stretch into the men's denim complex, it was a modest impact on product cost but not a huge impact on product cost. And I'm really pleased that as we've continued to feather it into the assortment, the incremental product cost has been overwhelmed by price realization. And so we've seen that he's actually willing to pay for and willing to pay more for it. So to me, this is being careful. But so far, the validation that customers are willing to pay for technical innovation in ready-to-wear is very clear across all of our brands and across the entire family.

And we have very encouraging metrics on all 3 of those that we, our customers, see us as expressing the brand appropriately and that they are responding to quality that they understand, recognize and value and our Fit consistency has continued to improve and it's been a real focus on bottoms. And that's a big deal for us. And when we are at our best, we really kill it on Fit. And she really appreciates that. But we've done too much wandering around the landscape over the last couple of years as we've tuned and tweaked fit and not had a consistent fit. It also, as you probably know, has an economic drag on the company, particularly in the online business because when you're inconsistent on Fit, she quickly learns that she's going to order a 2, a 4 and a 6, knowing that 4 is her size and then obviously, figuring out which one fits and then sending the other 2 back or returning them to a store. And that has a drag of cost and devalue of merchandise associated with it as well. So fit has been a big issue for me. And we're seeing some progress and response there. Next really is to bring the voice of the brand back and start telling the story. Because we have -- we increased marketing a little bit. We really pivoted it towards traffic and digital. But we've not been telling the story about the product and about the quality of the fit, et cetera, all the elements of the story to the extent that we need to. And so as we look at the back half, that's something that's very much on my mind. As you can imagine, I mean, that's part of the story at Old Navy, is that we've continued to put marketing against the business and we've seen the consumer respond to it.

With regard to the portfolio and the state of the fleet, we are, as you know, been very proactive in trying to stay ahead and take action on optimizing the fleet, with big announcements last year on the Gap fleet and then another announcement in Q1 of this year, closing another 75 stores in addition to those 175. So we are always open to looking to opportunities to optimize the fleet, but also, I think, Art mentioned in his remarks, to look for opportunities to grow the fleet where appropriate.

I'm really pleased with the extent to which we've filled that capacity out. The reality right now is that we are constrained in fully utilizing the back end by our front-end processes, which is why I also threw in the work that we're doing on demand-based buying. And that's really, if you really want to think about what that is, it's disaggregating what was a 4-season brand reveal, buy all at once, into a much more disaggregated, de-averaged buying process. And so we're working our way through that one right now. It is the constraint to scaling this at an enterprise level and Gap brand is doing the heavy lifting on the front end right now on behalf of the other parts of the company. And so we have a ways to go there, and it's really step-by-step.

Again, if you just start with where can we see this start to roll out, we are really pushing stretch in men's, which we're finding the men's customer really responds to across multiple fabrications and multiple wearing occasions. So if you're in Old Navy today, there's a stretch Oxford shirt in there that is super comfortable. It really, it's like this precision fit. We're pushing stretch across, really, in men's, our 2 key bottoms fabrications in terms of denim and twill, in both shorts and long bottoms. And really, testing where else we can go with it because we believe that it's actually really revolutionizing in many respects, that's a big word, but how men dress and the comfort and fit that they have in both tops and bottoms. So that's a step. We have nanotechnology in pants in Banana that we have basically not marketed at all, which is highly stain-resistant. If you pour a cup of coffee on the pants, it beads up and runs off. And we find that he has responded to that. Right now, to be honest, we are more using pre-existing fiber and fabric innovation from our vendors. But we're also reorganizing in order to be able to do work with some of our key vendors and be more proactive about driving innovation, which then, we believe, can unlock potentially, some proprietary benefits. And I don't want to get into that right now. It's a much longer conversation and it's early days. But we feel that our scale and our size, working as a $16 billion enterprise for the company, has the potential to not just benefit from pre-existing innovation but drive innovation. And so that's exciting for us as well. And it's across a number of different dimensions, whether it's, as I said, whether it's heat management, whether it's stain resistance, whether it's stretch and comfort, just to name a few right now that are out there."

We were over-assorted there. And so we are learning season over season, and we've made some changes even after we booked in order to tighten some of our programs up. So season over season, getting rebalanced for, again, key item programs but also making sure that we have depth in some of these fashion buys. That's something that is going to get better every season. I was just again in storage yesterday and I saw Gap show up again with the first full fall and you'll see that again with more depth in fashion as we get into September. So it's a season-over-season process and one where we're actively learning and managing our buys as aggressively as we can.

We're obviously extraordinarily well positioned in the denim business across all of our businesses, Banana has a great denim business now as well, it's front of the store. I'm not ready to say -- I'm always hopeful about denim, and it's been in the trough for a long time.

So it's hard to really generalize overall. But I would agree with Sabrina. North America better and international, more challenging."

I'm going to talk, as I have in all of the calls that we've had, really about both the long game and the short game. And let me start continuing to address the strategy and many of the things that I've been talking to about and give you an update on where we are there but then also, obviously, a deeper dive into Q3 and the prospects that I see as we look into this holiday period and Q4. 
We are, I would say, well into transforming and rebuilding parts of this company, starting with our product model. And I've talked to you about the work that we've been doing to enhance our response in this across all of our brands and in key categories to pivot towards a much more continuous and demand-based buying process, to test our products in advance of the buys that we're placing, to go into season open, et cetera, and I continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making but also acknowledging the fact that this is a journey, and there remains significant work in front of us. 
First and foremost, we need to win on product. And as I looked into Q4, I am feeling very good about the product that we have in our stores across all of our brands. Obviously, the consumers will tell us how well we are doing and how well we did with the products after we hindsight the season, but if I look across all of the businesses, I feel like we're in the best place that we've been now for several seasons, where we are lined up against trend, where we have consistent quality appropriate to the brands, where we've gotten our fit dialed into the point where it is consistent and where each brand is showing up expressing the DNA and the fingerprints of the brand. 
Second thing I'd like talk about is the fact that we are hands [ph] down focused on wringing every penny out of places where we have scale advantage, and that is obviously both on the product side of the equation but on the several billion dollars elsewhere in the company where we purchase a wide variety of things. And that is work that is not done, but it is work that is significantly under way and, again, work that I think has very significant payoff over the medium term. 
The third thing that I've spent time talking about is innovation in products. And again, we're in the early days of innovation in the ready-to-wear space, but already, there is good evidence of how we can crossruff innovation from the active side of the business into the ready-to-wear business and create meaningful benefits and have consumers connect with those product benefits in our ready-to-wear product. A good example of this is the Sculptek product that Athleta introduced a few months ago, performing very well in Athleta stores as a compression shaping product. It's also a proprietary fiber, and now we are moving to pull that into other bottoms fabrications, including denim and twill fabrications. And the properties that, that allows us to deliver in what is a traditional denim fabrication are actually quite extraordinary. And so as we get this up and running, I'm continuing to be very encouraged by how our consumers are responding to it, how we're delivering things beyond just trend to make the benefits of that product very meaningful to them. 
Demand-based buying is a critical piece and, again, to refresh your perspective, we and many others have traditionally bought the year one season on a grand reveal at a time. And that means making large commitments well in advance of when the product is going to be in the store and well in advance of knowing what the consumer really wants. So as we have been building the responsive supply chain capabilities, we have been also then reengineering the front end of the business so that we can buy on a much more continuous basis, in many cases, every month versus on a quarterly basis. And again, this brings several benefits. We remain open as we get closer to the season and can pivot to buy [ph] to the most meaningful trends in fabrications. But also, we are delivering newness constantly into our stores, which we know that our customers respond to. 
Outside of the product initiatives, we've also talked about CRM and about the customer and about data and about personalization and about technology. And we are not letting up on the throttle as we go after those areas as well. And you may have noted that in the last few months, I created a new role in the company led by a Chief Customer Officer who also has strategy. And that's really focused on bringing together every aspect of the customer across data, consumer insights, digital touch points and in-store experiences to create a holistic 360 view of the customer from which we can deliver meaningful benefits to that customer, whether they're benefits around loyalty, around personalization, around in-store experience and digital experience. 
Mobile obviously remains incredibly important, and we continue to see customers move from a desktop or a laptop experience to not just doing business on their mobile device but really engaging the brand on their mobile device. And as a consequence, we continue to put aggressive efforts against the mobile space. Some of it is just the basics but really important basics like continuing to improve site speed, how fast our pages load, allowing the mobile site to process a variety of forms of rich content that the consumer increasingly expects to have. We see mobile as fundamentally where our consumer starts and oftentimes ends their journey, and we need to make sure that we have a mobile experience that is commensurate with every other quality touch point that we have with our brands. 
Let me move to China for a second because it's fresh in my mind as I came back from a trip there just a week ago. I am very bullish on the long-term opportunity in China, and while I will acknowledge that the fact that the economy has cooled somewhat and the consumer is a little more cautious there has probably impacted everybody's business, it has not impacted my enthusiasm for the long-term potential in that market. We executed a strategy in Old Navy a couple of years ago where we put in place a number of stores across different types of locations, different store sizes, and we've been working that footprint now for the last several months in order to refine the four-wall model. 
Secondly, obviously, Gap was the business that we planted there first both in the specialty stores and the Gap factory stores, and we continue to see that the customer resonates to that brand and wants to participate in that brand. And third, the Chinese consumer is fundamentally an omni-channel consumer, and I remain very enthusiastic around an online business that has a significant penetration into the retail business and has very attractive economics. 
A moment on Q3. And obviously, Sabrina will take you deeper into the numbers. First of all, I'd say the retail environment, the apparel environment continues to be challenging. Traffic remains challenging, and as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well. We feel that it's appropriate to plan for that. Obviously, we're doing work to try to beat that trend, but we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging as we look forward. Given that, I'm actually pretty pleased with Q3 because I see positive momentum even against the backdrop of the Fishkill fire. And I won't go into the details of Fishkill. I will say just as a callout that I felt like our logistics team in this company did an extraordinary job of not missing a beat from the standpoint of rewiring our logistics network with our facility in the middle of the country and our facility on the West Coast and continuing to keep supply going into our stores on a very cost-efficient fashion. 
A quick perspective on Q4. I believe, as I said before, that we're well set up from the standpoint of the product and the assortment. Just as a sidebar again, we continue to move the needle in terms of customer-reported experience with fit and quality, which had been very intentional initiatives. I believe we've taken another step forward in the back half of the year and into Q4 on both of these dimensions. We're also putting marketing in the business in a way that we haven't over the last couple of years, with marketing both in BR and in Gap, including TV for Gap, and I'm excited because now is the time when we need to start filling the funnel with lapsed customers and new customers in order to buck the negative traffic trend. And while I've mentioned BR and Gap in terms of marketing, of course, Old Navy is lined up as they always are in Q4 with a strong marketing program, including the $100,000 a day giveaway for 8 days. 
So brand by brand, just a few comments. With Gap, right direction, continuing to show stronger women's performance that I'd like to call out because the core of that business obviously needs to be a strong women's business. 
In the kids assortment, we have a significant expression of licensed products, which I'm very excited about. We have not done a large licensing business, and particularly in Q4, we feel that has a lot of relevance. 
Old Navy, I think the numbers frankly speak for themselves, an excellent Q3, an exciting holiday campaign, strong marketing. I think if you walk into an Old Navy store right now, and I've spent a lot of time in those stores all around the country and all around the world, you will see incredible clarity of product message. You will see clear category presentations that are super easy to shop. That's the feedback that we get from our customer. 
You know the work that's been going on in Banana on quality and on aesthetic. Customer feedback is that both are significantly moving in the right direction. We have a holiday campaign, including a catalog, which we have not done for years. It is focused on reaching lapsed customers and new customers, and we believe we're set up to continue to the improvement of the business there that we're seeing. 
Athleta, I've nothing but good things to say, quite honestly. Positioned obviously against the very strong trend that continues to have legs underneath it, and again, Athleta is an active business. Athleta is also a lifestyle business, and that's really the core of Athleta's positioning, that confluence of active and lifestyle, which their customers very much respond to. I haven't spoken about marketing in Athleta. We have a very connected customer there, the holiday campaign, Share Your Light, is a campaign that is focused on strong community engagement, which is really a place of strength for them. I expect Athleta to carry their momentum into Q4. I expect Athleta to continue to perform as we get into next year as well. Again, that confluence of lifestyle and performance is powerful. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago about Sabrina Simmons leaving the company, and then just a few days ago, about Teri List-Stoll joining as CFO. 
First on Teri, I've spent quite a bit of time getting to know her, time in stores, time with product, time across a variety of places in the business, and I'm really excited about her joining the team and the perspective that she brings from her experience. You'll obviously get more time to get to know her. Some of you may know her already, but I'm very excited about having her on the team and looking forward to her joining in January. 
Let me turn to Sabrina. She will be missed. I'm sure missed by you and most certainly missed by me and the team here. She's been an incredible partner to me. In her 9 years as CFO, she has obviously been very passionate about our capital structure, about our investment thesis and just an incredible contributor to the company and in our relationships with the investment community. In 15 years at the company, she's done nothing but perform in an exemplary fashion in every role, and so I will miss her. I want to thank her. I'm very appreciative that she will be here until the end of the fiscal year to facilitate a very orderly and structured transition. 
And with that, Sabrina, let me turn it over to you."

Comp sales we",575,"Thanks so much for your generous comments, Art. It's been a great 15-year run and a true privilege to serve the company and our shareholders. 
Now moving on to third quarter performance. Sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 2% versus last year. Comp sales were down 3%. We were pleased that third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points over last year, largely driven by Old Navy. Merchandise margins expanded 220 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. 
Moving to expenses. Third quarter total operating expenses were up $78 million to $1.1 billion, including about $35 million related to restructuring charges. Marketing expenses were up $6 million to $148 million. 
Regarding taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 45.2%. The higher rate was driven by the impact from our restructuring actions, primarily in Japan. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 5 percentage points lower. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.51. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $30 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date nontax-related restructuring costs to about $180 million. Excluding the tax and nontax impact of restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with inventory down 4% year-over-year. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the fourth quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. Our year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $415 million. 
Regarding capital expenditures and square footage. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $383 million versus $505 million last year. Square footage was down 2% compared with last year. 
With regard to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.87 to $1.92, excluding restructuring costs. 
A few things to note about the assumptions around our guidance. First, per published reports, industry traffic has decelerated November month-to-date. Second, as Art mentioned, given that challenging traffic trends have continued, we are investing meaningfully in marketing across our portfolio of brands during the holiday season. We are not necessarily expecting an immediate payback from these investments but consider them to be important for the longer-term health of the business. Additionally, we are lapping bonus reversals last year, which are also a headwind to Q4 expense. Therefore, we expect SG&A to deleverage in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Third, we expect rent and occupancy to be more pressured in the fourth quarter due to preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship locations for both Gap and Old Navy scheduled to open in the back half of 2017. 
Given all of these factors, we continue to feel our guidance represents a prudent range. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. We expect the negative impact from the fire at our distribution center to be just over 1 pump [ph] point in the fourth quarter. Similar to Q3, the impact will be highest to Gap brand and lowest at Old Navy. 
Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 3%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of down 2%, driven by additional Gap store closures. 
Regarding our restructuring costs. We now estimate the full year impact to be between $0.42 and $0.46, down from our previous estimate of $0.45 to $0.50. 
All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

It's not as consistent as I would hope it is, and I see it across the whole industry right now. It is clearly she's refreshing her closet, but it's still not a strong dominant trend with super-new news out there. Obviously, with Gap, we're focused on that. Stretch in across all fabrications across the entire family is something that we're rapidly ramping up, both in the kids business as well as the adult business.

But as we look forward to summer, fall and holiday '17, I know the teams are really embracing the lessons from this fall and holiday and very much are aligned in looking to continue to buy units very tightly.

A couple of things to point out in terms of differences between Q3 and Q4, Lindsay. As we all know, Q4 tends to be much more promotional and competitive than Q3. And then this Q3, of course, was unique because we lost a lot of units in the fire, a lot of those units were fall fashion. So we were supertight on fashion in Q3, and that likely supported the nice outcome on margins. In contrast, in Q4, we didn't lose any holiday fashion in the fire. So we still have basics and seasonal basics that were lost and supposed to be sold, but none of our holiday, in any meaningful way, was lost. So we have more fashion in Q4 than we have in Q3. Now if traffic improves and we move the units as expected in the time we want it, at the velocity we want it, then all is going to be well. But as we mentioned, traffic has started out sort of stubborn and still challenged. And so I just sort of feel like, given those facts, it's too early to get overly optimistic, although, obviously, the teams will be driving toward that some improvement year-over-year. So that's the margin piece. With regards to the expense piece, there's lots of moving parts in expense. Marketing was actually only up $6 million. There were a bunch of other components, some of which are investments for the long term that the company has decided to make. Art mentioned, for example, the whole customer space and hiring a key customer officer and what comes with that. So we are starting to invest some. And then as I've been talking about for some time, since we're lapping many years of very tight expense management, it really gets super tough to try and leverage unless you have a very solid positive comp.

We are starting to make some decisions to make certain investments in the business. And I talked about 1 or 2 of those already in overhead and people -- in the form of people and also in marketing, especially in Q4.

Probably the most consistent theme, obviously, is continued FX pressure there. And Gap is more exposed to that, as you know, than any other business. If you look across the key pieces of the portfolio for Gap brand, the Japanese economy has obviously been challenging for everyone. We've seen some firming up of the business, I would describe, recently. But we have a long way to go there to get to the kind of performance we want to look at. I talked about China in my remarks. I won't really dwell on that. Continue to be optimistic in the long run, but it's been, I think, probably the most promotional time we've seen in that market since we've been present there with all of development competitors, both local and nonlocal, breaking sale for earlier having sale go deeper and longer than we previously experienced, which indicates the misbalance of inventory and demand right now that's in that market. And then Europe continues to be Europe. We've announced obviously the actions that we've taken there in terms of closing some stores. We have a very good online business there, but especially business obviously carries a very significant blood on its P&L, but it's been an issue that we've had there for long time.

We are making excellent progress and really more of the challenge right now is the operating model of the businesses and being able to exploit it. Demand-based buying is an example.

We're actually doing some pretty -- pretty much -- pretty deep work right now on pricing. So it's something that's really on my mind. We did some work at Old Navy, which are now in the process of implementing, which highlighted some pretty material opportunity, and we're repeating that work inside of Gap brand as well. I guess I'd highlight a couple of things if I look at denim it. First of all, if you look at where we are from the standpoint of both our tickets and our actuals, we actually play in a pretty narrow range. If you think about denim where it is, denim is starts at an $8 entry-level price point all the way up to multiple hundreds of dollars, and we really across all of our brands, are very tightly banded. So I think there's a breadth fabrication, good, better, best, if you want to think about it that way. The Gap has an opportunity to step up to in terms of product development. And that's probably biggest on my mind right now. The second issue is, we have seen where we've been able to have pricing authority, but it hasn't been consistent enough. And that comes a bit with the quality of our buys. And it comes, I think, with making sure again that we're dialed into on trend across the entire buy. I'm really focused on denim from a market share standpoint and that's how we're thinking about it in the company. And I've been very pleased with what I've seen at Old Navy where we have been on a consistent posture of gaining market share in denim. And we're doing the work both in denim and the Gap to make sure that those [ph] businesses are moving forward that way as well. Again, if I reiterate it, probably the biggest opportunity as I see it is the breadth of our development, and therefore, how we straddle where demand is in the marketplace right now from a price point standpoint, and we're pretty narrow relative to where I think we can play."

And the work that we're doing right now is to really sort of the core operating platform by bringing all of those things together that are not customer-facing and then skinning that operating platform where it faces the customer and the brand needs to be expressed. And I've talked about that before, and that is a process that is underway right now. And certainly doing that from a product standpoint, we moved first in terms of product a few years ago, we moved away from a geographic base sourcing network to a category based sourcing network. So there's no [ph] office doing denim for every brand on behalf of the company where we can then bring to bear our scale working with mills and vendors in order offer to get the best possible cost and the best possible quality simultaneously. It's been a bit mixed inside of other things as well.

I have a very strong conviction that successful brands today, our story brands tell all around and you can see the ones that are 3 telling the story and the ones that aren't. We have a great story to tell. We've just been a little too quiet with Banana and Gap by design, but we've been quiet until we felt like the product made a telling the story. And that's really where my head is at right now. I think -- I will take the credit here for wanting to be conservative on marketing because I did not want to invite aggressively in by customers back into our stores and so I felt like the product was going to be where it need to be. On Gap brand, specifically, again, it's not perfect, but the clarity of presentation that you should see in our stores, where we've really tried to tighten up to a category and merchandising. The trend that we have in our stores, and I asked the question the other day of all of our brands, I just have to know weekend I was traveling and watching and listening to people. I said, just tell me we all actually have felt it, which is super on trend right now across every single one of our businesses, from Athleta, Old Navy, in the Intermix. I feel like we're in a better spot and we're getting better season over season as well. So as I said before, I'm cautiously optimistic in Q4, and I will continue to be as we look into next year. Thank you."

I'm going to talk, as I have in all of the calls that we've had, really about both the long game and the short game. And let me start continuing to address the strategy and many of the things that I've been talking to about and give you an update on where we are there but then also, obviously, a deeper dive into Q3 and the prospects that I see as we look into this holiday period and Q4. 
We are, I would say, well into transforming and rebuilding parts of this company, starting with our product model. And I've talked to you about the work that we've been doing to enhance our response in this across all of our brands and in key categories to pivot towards a much more continuous and demand-based buying process, to test our products in advance of the buys that we're placing, to go into season open, et cetera, and I continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making but also acknowledging the fact that this is a journey, and there remains significant work in front of us. 
First and foremost, we need to win on product. And as I looked into Q4, I am feeling very good about the product that we have in our stores across all of our brands. Obviously, the consumers will tell us how well we are doing and how well we did with the products after we hindsight the season, but if I look across all of the businesses, I feel like we're in the best place that we've been now for several seasons, where we are lined up against trend, where we have consistent quality appropriate to the brands, where we've gotten our fit dialed into the point where it is consistent and where each brand is showing up expressing the DNA and the fingerprints of the brand. 
Second thing I'd like talk about is the fact that we are heads down focused on wringing every penny out of places where we have scale advantage, and that is obviously both on the product side of the equation but on the several billion dollars elsewhere in the company where we purchase a wide variety of things. And that is work that is not done, but it is work that is significantly under way and, again, work that I think has very significant payoff over the medium term. 
The third thing that I've spent time talking about is innovation in products. And again, we're in the early days of innovation in the ready-to-wear space, but already, there is good evidence of how we can crossruff innovation from the active side of the business into the ready-to-wear business and create meaningful benefits and have consumers connect with those product benefits in our ready-to-wear product. A good example of this is the Sculptek product that Athleta introduced a few months ago, performing very well in Athleta stores as a compression shaping product. It's also a proprietary fiber, and now we are moving to pull that into other bottoms fabrications, including denim and twill fabrications. And the properties that, that allows us to deliver in what is a traditional denim fabrication are actually quite extraordinary. And so as we get this up and running, I'm continuing to be very encouraged by how our consumers are responding to it, how we're delivering things beyond just trend to make the benefits of that product very meaningful to them. 
Demand-based buying is a critical piece and, again, to refresh your perspective, we and many others have traditionally bought the year one season on a grand reveal at a time. And that means making large commitments well in advance of when the product is going to be in the store and well in advance of knowing what the consumer really wants. So as we have been building the responsive supply chain capabilities, we have been also then reengineering the front end of the business so that we can buy on a much more continuous basis, in many cases, every month versus on a quarterly basis. And again, this brings several benefits. We remain open as we get closer to the season and can pivot to buy to the most meaningful trends in fabrications. But also, we are delivering newness constantly into our stores, which we know that our customers respond to. 
Outside of the product initiatives, we've also talked about CRM and about the customer and about data and about personalization and about technology. And we are not letting up on the throttle as we go after those areas as well. And you may have noted that in the last few months, I created a new role in the company led by a Chief Customer Officer who also has strategy. And that's really focused on bringing together every aspect of the customer across data, consumer insights, digital touch points and in-store experiences to create a holistic 360 view of the customer from which we can deliver meaningful benefits to that customer, whether they're benefits around loyalty, around personalization, around in-store experience and digital experience. 
Mobile obviously remains incredibly important, and we continue to see customers move from a desktop or a laptop experience to not just doing business on their mobile device but really engaging the brand on their mobile device. And as a consequence, we continue to put aggressive efforts against the mobile space. Some of it is just the basics but really important basics like continuing to improve site speed, how fast our pages load, allowing the mobile site to process a variety of forms of rich content that the consumer increasingly expects to have. We see mobile as fundamentally where our consumer starts and oftentimes ends their journey, and we need to make sure that we have a mobile experience that is commensurate with every other quality touch point that we have with our brands. 
Let me move to China for a second because it's fresh in my mind as I came back from a trip there just a week ago. I am very bullish on the long-term opportunity in China, and while I will acknowledge that the fact that the economy has cooled somewhat and the consumer is a little more cautious there has probably impacted everybody's business, it has not impacted my enthusiasm for the long-term potential in that market. We executed a strategy in Old Navy a couple of years ago where we put in place a number of stores across different types of locations, different store sizes, and we've been working that footprint now for the last several months in order to refine the four-wall model. 
Secondly, obviously, Gap was the business that we planted there first both in the specialty stores and the Gap factory stores, and we continue to see that the customer resonates to that brand and wants to participate in that brand. And third, the Chinese consumer is fundamentally an omni-channel consumer, and I remain very enthusiastic around an online business that has a significant penetration into the retail business and has very attractive economics. 
A moment on Q3. And obviously, Sabrina will take you deeper into the numbers. First of all, I'd say the retail environment, the apparel environment continues to be challenging. Traffic remains challenging, and as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well. We feel that it's appropriate to plan for that. Obviously, we're doing work to try to beat that trend, but we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging as we look forward. Given that, I'm actually pretty pleased with Q3 because I see positive momentum even against the backdrop of the Fishkill fire. And I won't go into the details of Fishkill. I will say just as a callout that I felt like our logistics team in this company did an extraordinary job of not missing a beat from the standpoint of rewiring our logistics network with our facility in the middle of the country and our facility on the West Coast and continuing to keep supply going into our stores on a very cost-efficient fashion. 
A quick perspective on Q4. I believe, as I said before, that we're well set up from the standpoint of the product and the assortment. Just as a sidebar again, we continue to move the needle in terms of customer-reported experience with fit and quality, which had been very intentional initiatives. I believe we've taken another step forward in the back half of the year and into Q4 on both of these dimensions. We're also putting marketing in the business in a way that we haven't over the last couple of years, with marketing both in BR and in Gap, including TV for Gap, and I'm excited because now is the time when we need to start filling the funnel with lapsed customers and new customers in order to buck the negative traffic trend. And while I've mentioned BR and Gap in terms of marketing, of course, Old Navy is lined up as they always are in Q4 with a strong marketing program, including the $100,000 a day giveaway for 8 days. 
So brand by brand, just a few comments. With Gap, right direction, continuing to show stronger women's performance that I'd like to call out because the core of that business obviously needs to be a strong women's business. 
In the kids assortment, we have a significant expression of licensed products, which I'm very excited about. We have not done a large licensing business, and particularly in Q4, we feel that has a lot of relevance. 
Old Navy, I think the numbers frankly speak for themselves, an excellent Q3, an exciting holiday campaign, strong marketing. I think if you walk into an Old Navy store right now, and I've spent a lot of time in those stores all around the country and all around the world, you will see incredible clarity of product message. You will see clear category presentations that are super easy to shop. That's the feedback that we get from our customer. 
You know the work that's been going on in Banana on quality and on aesthetic. Customer feedback is that both are significantly moving in the right direction. We have a holiday campaign, including a catalog, which we have not done for years. It is focused on reaching lapsed customers and new customers, and we believe we're set up to continue to the improvement of the business there that we're seeing. 
Athleta, I've nothing but good things to say, quite honestly. Positioned obviously against the very strong trend that continues to have legs underneath it, and again, Athleta is an active business. Athleta is also a lifestyle business, and that's really the core of Athleta's positioning, that confluence of active and lifestyle, which their customers very much respond to. I haven't spoken about marketing in Athleta. We have a very connected customer there, the holiday campaign, Share Your Light, is a campaign that is focused on strong community engagement, which is really a place of strength for them. I expect Athleta to carry their momentum into Q4. I expect Athleta to continue to perform as we get into next year as well. Again, that confluence of lifestyle and performance is powerful. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago about Sabrina Simmons leaving the company, and then just a few days ago, about Teri List-Stoll joining as CFO. 
First on Teri, I've spent quite a bit of time getting to know her, time in stores, time with product, time across a variety of places in the business, and I'm really excited about her joining the team and the perspective that she brings from her experience. You'll obviously get more time to get to know her. Some of you may know her already, but I'm very excited about having her on the team and looking forward to her joining in January. 
Let me turn to Sabrina. She will be missed. I'm sure missed by you and most certainly missed by me and the team here. She's been an incredible partner to me. In her 9 years as CFO, she has obviously been very passionate about our capital structure, about our investment thesis and just an incredible contributor to the company and in our relationships with the investment community. In 15 years at the company, she's done nothing but perform in an exemplary fashion in every role, and so I will miss her. I want to thank her. I'm very appreciative that she will be here until the end of the fiscal year to facilitate a very orderly and structured transition. 
And with that, Sabrina, let me turn it over to you."

Comp sales we",575,"Thanks so much for your generous comments, Art. It's been a great 15-year run and a true privilege to serve the company and our shareholders. 
Now moving on to third quarter performance. Sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 2% versus last year. Comp sales were down 3%. We were pleased that third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points over last year, largely driven by Old Navy. Merchandise margins expanded 220 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. 
Moving to expenses. Third quarter total operating expenses were up $78 million to $1.1 billion, including about $35 million related to restructuring charges. Marketing expenses were up $6 million to $148 million. 
Regarding taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 45.2%. The higher rate was driven by the impact from our restructuring actions, primarily in Japan. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 5 percentage points lower. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.51. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $30 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date nontax-related restructuring costs to about $180 million. Excluding the tax and nontax impact of restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with inventory down 4% year-over-year. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the fourth quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. Our year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $415 million. 
Regarding capital expenditures and square footage. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $383 million versus $505 million last year. Square footage was down 2% compared with last year. 
With regard to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.87 to $1.92, excluding restructuring costs. 
A few things to note about the assumptions around our guidance. First, per published reports, industry traffic has decelerated November month-to-date. Second, as Art mentioned, given that challenging traffic trends have continued, we are investing meaningfully in marketing across our portfolio of brands during the holiday season. We are not necessarily expecting an immediate payback from these investments but consider them to be important for the longer-term health of the business. Additionally, we are lapping bonus reversals last year, which are also a headwind to Q4 expense. Therefore, we expect SG&A to deleverage in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Third, we expect rent and occupancy to be more pressured in the fourth quarter due to preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship locations for both Gap and Old Navy scheduled to open in the back half of 2017. 
Given all of these factors, we continue to feel our guidance represents a prudent range. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. We expect the negative impact from the fire at our distribution center to be just over 1 hump [ph] point in the fourth quarter. Similar to Q3, the impact will be highest to Gap brand and lowest at Old Navy. 
Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 3%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of down 2%, driven by additional Gap store closures. 
Regarding our restructuring costs. We now estimate the full year impact to be between $0.42 and $0.46, down from our previous estimate of $0.45 to $0.50. 
All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

It's not as consistent as I would hope it is, and I see it across the whole industry right now. It is clearly she's refreshing her closet, but it's still not a strong dominant trend with super-new news out there. Obviously, with Gap, we're focused on that. Stretch in across all fabrications across the entire family is something that we're rapidly ramping up, both in the kids business as well as the adult business.

A couple of things to point out in terms of differences between Q3 and Q4, Lindsay. As we all know, Q4 tends to be much more promotional and competitive than Q3. And then this Q3, of course, was unique because we lost a lot of units in the fire, a lot of those units were fall fashion. So we were supertight on fashion in Q3, and that likely supported the nice outcome on margins. In contrast, in Q4, we didn't lose any holiday fashion in the fire. So we still have basics and seasonal basics that were lost and supposed to be sold, but none of our holiday, in any meaningful way, was lost. So we have more fashion in Q4 than we have in Q3. Now if traffic improves and we move the units as expected in the time we want it, at the velocity we want it, then all is going to be well. But as we mentioned, traffic has started out sort of stubborn and still challenged. And so I just sort of feel like, given those facts, it's too early to get overly optimistic, although, obviously, the teams will be driving toward that some improvement year-over-year. So that's the margin piece. With regards to the expense piece, there's lots of moving parts in expense. Marketing was actually only up $6 million. There were a bunch of other components, some of which are investments for the long term that the company has decided to make. Art mentioned, for example, the whole customer space and hiring a key customer officer and what comes with that. So we are starting to invest some. And then as I've been talking about for some time, since we're lapping many years of very tight expense management, it really gets super tough to try and leverage unless you have a very solid positive comp.

Now what we said at the time is, again, after years of very tight management, part of the reason we chose to do that restructuring is because it would help offset some of the natural inflation that you get running our business and would allow us to continue to be disciplined in our operating expenses. We are starting to make some decisions to make certain investments in the business. And I talked about 1 or 2 of those already in overhead and people -- in the form of people and also in marketing, especially in Q4.

Art can talk more about what we see under the covers, but certainly, it's encouraging to see that women, as the year has progressed, has been stronger than men.

I mean, the international business is obviously a composite of a number of different markets, which have a variety of things going on in them. Probably the most consistent theme, obviously, is continued FX pressure there. And Gap is more exposed to that, as you know, than any other business. If you look across the key pieces of the portfolio for Gap brand, the Japanese economy has obviously been challenging for everyone. We've seen some firming up of the business, I would describe, recently. But we have a long way to go there to get to the kind of performance we want to look at. I talked about China in my remarks. I won't really dwell on that. Continue to be optimistic in the long run, but it's been, I think, probably the most promotional time we've seen in that market since we've been present there with all development competitors, both local and nonlocal, breaking sale far earlier, having sale go deeper and longer than we've previously experienced, which indicates the misbalance of inventory and demand right now that's in that market. And then Europe continues to be Europe. We've announced, obviously, the actions that we've taken there in terms of closing some stores. We have a very good online business there. The specialty business, obviously, carries a very significant blood on its P&L, and that's been an issue that we've had there for a long time. So it's a real mixed bag. And then in parts of the business in Canada, Canada's been very strong for us. It's been a very good business. So it's really a function of which market you're looking at."

We're still buying one category on a traditional pipeline, like outerwear, but in other categories like bottoms and knits, we've significantly improved the responsiveness of the category. We're making excellent progress. And really, more of the challenge right now is the operating model of the businesses and being able to exploit it. Demand-based buying, as an example, we're building tools against that right now versus doing it by brute force. It's more about the front end of the  business than really the back end of the business right now.

And we're actually doing some pretty -- pretty much -- pretty deep work right now on pricing. So it's something that's really on my mind. We did some work at Old Navy, which are now in the process of implementing, which highlighted some pretty material opportunity, and we're repeating that work inside of Gap brand as well. I guess, I'd highlight a couple of things if I look at denim. First of all, if you look at where we are from the standpoint of both our tickets and our actuals, we actually play in a pretty narrow range. If you think about denim where it is, denim is -- starts at an $8 entry-level price point, all the way up to multiple hundreds of dollars. And we, really across all of our brands, are very tightly banded. So I think there is a breadth of fabrication, good, better, best, if you want to think about it that way, The Gap has an opportunity to step up to in terms of product development. And that's probably biggest on my mind right now. The second issue is, is we have seen where we've been able to have pricing authority, but it hasn't been consistent enough. And that comes a bit with the quality of our buys. And it comes, I think, with making sure, again, that we're dialed in and on trend across the entire buy. I'm really focused on denim from a market share standpoint, and that's how we're thinking about it in the company. And I've been very pleased with what I've seen at Old Navy where we have been on a consistent posture of gaining market share in denim. And we're doing the work both in Banana and Gap to make sure that those businesses are moving forward that way as well. Again, if I reiterate it, probably the biggest opportunity as I see it is the breadth of our development and, therefore, how we straddle where demand sits in the marketplace right now from a price point standpoint. And we're pretty narrow relative to where I think we can play."

What I would tell you is that over the course of this year, as you all know, from comp reporting and our sales reporting, Banana has had the most pressure over the last little while.

Dana, I would say that we're -- let me set back for a second, and I'll just simplistically characterize the work that we're doing, which is we've operated this company historically more as independent businesses with relatively separate but duplicative activities inside of each business, not entirely because we had a common sourcing structure, a common IT platform, et cetera. But in a lot of other places, it's been relatively more independent. And the work that we're doing right now is to really build on sort of the core operating platform by bringing all of those things together that are not customer-facing and then skinning that operating platform where it faces the customer and the brand needs to be expressed. And I've talked about that before, and that is a process that is under way right now. And we're certainly doing that from a product standpoint. We moved first in terms of product a few years ago when we moved away from a geographic-based sourcing network to a category-based sourcing network. So there's a lot of office doing denim for every brand on behalf of the company where we can then bring to bear our scale working with mills and vendors in order to get the best possible cost and the best possible quality simultaneously. It's been a bit mixed inside of other things as well. I think we have an opportunity, especially in the environment we're in right now, from the standpoint of real estate and our relationship with our landlords. And then there's just a wide variety of costs, some media that we buy and have bought separately we're bringing together, et cetera. So I'd like to -- I'd love to tell you and give you an exact number. It is material, and it will continue to progressively pay it out. I mean, I've been very clear with the company on this one that I want this done. I want it done ASAP. I want the benefits in hand. And then we'll choose how much of those benefits we want to invest and how much of those benefits we want to bring to the bottom line."

And therefore, it's why we made the decision to put some marketing into the business is to start telling the story. I -- when I was running Gap back in 2012, we fixed the product.

I have a very strong conviction that successful brands today, our story with brands, it's all around us and you can see the ones that are telling the story and the ones that aren't. And we have a great story to tell. We've just been a little too quiet with Banana and Gap by design, but we've been quiet until we felt like the product merited telling the story. And that's really where my head is at right now. I think -- I will take the credit here for wanting to be conservative on marketing because I did not want to invite -- aggressively invite customers back into our stores, and so I felt like the product was going to be where it needed to be. On Gap brand, specifically, again, it's not perfect. But the clarity of presentation that you should see in our stores, where we've really tried to tighten up to a category merchandising, the trend that we have in our stores, and I asked the question the other day of all of our brands, I just sent a note out over the weekend as I was traveling and watching and listening to people. I said, ""Just tell me you all have velvet."" And we all actually have velvet, which is super on trend right now across every single one of our businesses, from Athleta, Old Navy, in the Intermix. I feel like we're in a better spot, and we're getting better season over season as well. So I am -- as I said before, I'm cautiously optimistic on Q4, and I will continue to be as we look into next year. Thank you."

I'm going to talk, as I have in all of the calls that we've had, really about both the long game and the short game. And let me start continuing to address the strategy and many of the things that I've been talking to about and give you an update on where we are there but then also, obviously, a deeper dive into Q3 and the prospects that I see as we look into this holiday period and Q4. 
We are, I would say, well into transforming and rebuilding parts of this company, starting with our product model. And I've talked to you about the work that we've been doing to enhance our response in this across all of our brands and in key categories to pivot towards a much more continuous and demand-based buying process, to test our products in advance of the buys that we're placing, to go into season open, et cetera, and I continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making but also acknowledging the fact that this is a journey, and there remains significant work in front of us. 
First and foremost, we need to win on product. And as I looked into Q4, I am feeling very good about the product that we have in our stores across all of our brands. Obviously, the consumers will tell us how well we are doing and how well we did with the products after we hindsight the season, but if I look across all of the businesses, I feel like we're in the best place that we've been now for several seasons, where we are lined up against trend, where we have consistent quality appropriate to the brands, where we've gotten our fit dialed into the point where it is consistent and where each brand is showing up expressing the DNA and the fingerprints of the brand. 
Second thing that I've talked about is the fact that we are heads down focused on wringing every penny out of places where we have scale advantage, and that is obviously both on the product side of the equation but on the several billion dollars elsewhere in the company where we purchase a wide variety of things. And that is work that is not done, but it is work that is significantly under way and, again, work that I think has very significant payoff over the medium term. 
The third thing that I've spent time talking about is innovation in products. And again, we're in the early days of innovation in the ready-to-wear space, but already, there is good evidence of how we can crossruff innovation from the active side of the business into the ready-to-wear business and create meaningful benefits and have consumers connect with those product benefits in our ready-to-wear product. A good example of this is the Sculptek product that Athleta introduced a few months ago, performing very well in Athleta stores as a compression shaping product. It's also a proprietary fiber, and now we are moving to pull that into other bottoms fabrications, including denim and twill fabrications. And the properties that, that allows us to deliver in what is a traditional denim fabrication are actually quite extraordinary. And so as we get this up and running, I'm continuing to be very encouraged by how our consumers are responding to it, how we're delivering things beyond just trend to make the benefits of that product very meaningful to them. 
Demand-based buying is a critical piece and, again, to refresh your perspective, we and many others have traditionally bought the year one season on a grand reveal at a time. And that means making large commitments well in advance of when the product is going to be in the store and well in advance of knowing what the consumer really wants. So as we have been building the responsive supply chain capabilities, we have been also then reengineering the front end of the business so that we can buy on a much more continuous basis, in many cases, every month versus on a quarterly basis. And again, this brings several benefits. We remain open as we get closer to the season and can pivot to buy to the most meaningful trends in fabrications. But also, we are delivering newness constantly into our stores, which we know that our customers respond to. 
Outside of the product initiatives, we've also talked about CRM and about the customer and about data and about personalization and about technology. And we are not letting up on the throttle as we go after those areas as well. And you may have noted that in the last few months, I created a new role in the company led by a Chief Customer Officer who also has strategy. And that's really focused on bringing together every aspect of the customer across data, consumer insights, digital touch points and in-store experiences to create a holistic 360 view of the customer from which we can deliver meaningful benefits to that customer, whether they're benefits around loyalty, around personalization, around in-store experience and digital experience. 
Mobile obviously remains incredibly important, and we continue to see customers move from a desktop or a laptop experience to not just doing business on their mobile device but really engaging the brand on their mobile device. And as a consequence, we continue to put aggressive efforts against the mobile space. Some of it is just the basics but really important basics like continuing to improve site speed, how fast our pages load, allowing the mobile site to process a variety of forms of rich content that the consumer increasingly expects to have. We see mobile as fundamentally where our consumer starts and oftentimes ends their journey, and we need to make sure that we have a mobile experience that is commensurate with every other quality touch point that we have with our brands. 
Let me move to China for a second because it's fresh in my mind as I came back from a trip there just a week ago. I am very bullish on the long-term opportunity in China, and while I will acknowledge that the fact that the economy has cooled somewhat and the consumer is a little more cautious there has probably impacted everybody's business, it has not impacted my enthusiasm for the long-term potential in that market. We executed a strategy in Old Navy a couple of years ago where we put in place a number of stores across different types of locations, and different store sizes, and we've been working that footprint now for the last several months in order to refine the four-wall model. 
Secondly, obviously, Gap was the business that we planted there first both in the specialty stores and the Gap factory stores, and we continue to see that the customer resonates to that brand and wants to participate in that brand. And third, the Chinese consumer is fundamentally an omni-channel consumer, and I remain very enthusiastic around an online business that has a significant penetration into the retail business and has very attractive economics. 
A moment on Q3. And obviously, Sabrina will take you deeper into the numbers. First of all, I'd say the retail environment and the apparel environment continues to be challenging. Traffic remains challenging, and as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well. We feel that it's appropriate to plan for that. Obviously, we're doing work to try to beat that trend, but we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging as we look forward. Given that, I'm actually pretty pleased with Q3 because I see positive momentum even against the backdrop of the Fishkill fire. And I won't go into the details of Fishkill. I will say just as a callout that I felt like our logistics team in this company did an extraordinary job of not missing a beat from the standpoint of rewiring our logistics network with our facility in the middle of the country and our facility on the West Coast and continuing to keep supply going into our stores on a very cost-efficient fashion. 
A quick perspective on Q4. I believe, as I said before, that we're well set up from the standpoint of the product and the assortment. Just as a sidebar again, we continue to move the needle in terms of customer-reported experience with fit and quality, which had been very intentional initiatives. I believe we've taken another step forward in the back half of the year and into Q4 on both of these dimensions. We're also putting marketing into the business in a way that we haven't over the last couple of years, with marketing both in BR and in Gap, including TV for Gap, and I'm excited because now is the time when we need to start filling the funnel with lapsed customers and new customers in order to buck the negative traffic trend. And while I've mentioned BR and Gap in terms of marketing, of course, Old Navy is lined up as they always are in Q4 with a strong marketing program, including the $100,000 a day giveaway for 8 days. 
So brand by brand, just a few comments. With Gap, right direction, continuing to show stronger women's performance that I'd like to call out because the core of that business obviously needs to be a strong women's business. 
In the kids assortment, we have a significant expression of licensed products, which I'm very excited about. We have not done a large licensing business, and particularly in Q4, we feel that has a lot of relevance. 
Old Navy, I think the numbers frankly speak for themselves, an excellent Q3, an exciting holiday campaign, strong marketing. I think if you walk into an Old Navy store right now, and I've spent a lot of time in those stores all around the country and all around the world, you will see incredible clarity of product message. You will see clear category presentations that are super easy to shop. That's the feedback that we get from our customer. 
You know the work that's been going on in Banana on quality and on aesthetic. Customer feedback is that both are significantly moving in the right direction. We have a holiday campaign, including a catalog, which we have not done for years. It is focused on reaching lapsed customers and new customers, and we believe we're set up to continue the improvement of the business there that we're seeing. 
Athleta, I've nothing but good things to say, quite honestly. Positioned obviously against a very strong trend that continues to have legs underneath it, and again, Athleta is an active business. Athleta is also a lifestyle business, and that's really the core of Athleta's positioning, that confluence of active and lifestyle, which their customers very much respond to. I haven't spoken about marketing in Athleta. We have a very connected customer there, the holiday campaign, Share Your Light, is a campaign that is focused on strong community engagement, which is really a place of strength for them. I expect Athleta to carry their momentum into Q4. I expect Athleta to continue to perform as we get into next year as well. Again, that confluence of lifestyle and performance is powerful. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago about Sabrina Simmons leaving the company, and then just a few days ago, about Teri List-Stoll joining as CFO. 
First on Teri, I've spent quite a bit of time getting to know her, time in stores, time with product, time across a variety of places in the business, and I'm really excited about her joining the team and the perspective that she brings from her experience. You'll obviously get more time to get to know her. Some of you may know her already, but I'm very excited about having her on the team and looking forward to her joining in January. 
Let me turn to Sabrina. She will be missed. I'm sure missed by you and most certainly missed by me and the team here. She's been an incredible partner to me. In her 9 years as CFO, she has obviously been very passionate about our capital structure, about our investment thesis and just an incredible contributor to the company and in our relationships with the investment community. In 15 years at the company, she's done nothing but perform in an exemplary fashion in every role, and so I will miss her. I want to thank her. I'm very appreciative that she will be here until the end of the fiscal year to facilitate a very orderly and structured transition. 
And with that, Sabrina, let me turn it over to you."

Comp sales we",575,"Thanks so much for your generous comments, Art. It's been a great 15-year run and a true privilege to serve the company and our shareholders. 
Now moving on to third quarter performance. Sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 2% versus last year. Comp sales were down 3%. We were pleased that third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points over last year, largely driven by Old Navy. Merchandise margins expanded 220 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. 
Moving to expenses. Third quarter total operating expenses were up $78 million to $1.1 billion, including about $35 million related to restructuring charges. Marketing expenses were up $6 million to $148 million. 
Regarding taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 45.2%. The higher rate was driven by the impact from our restructuring actions, primarily in Japan. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 5 percentage points lower. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.51. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $30 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date nontax-related restructuring costs to about $180 million. Excluding the tax and nontax impact of restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with inventory down 4% year-over-year. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the fourth quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. Our year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $415 million. 
Regarding capital expenditures and square footage. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $383 million versus $505 million last year. Square footage was down 2% compared with last year. 
With regard to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.87 to $1.92, excluding restructuring costs. 
A few things to note about the assumptions around our guidance. First, per published reports, industry traffic has decelerated November month-to-date. Second, as Art mentioned, given that challenging traffic trends have continued, we are investing meaningfully in marketing across our portfolio of brands during the holiday season. We are not necessarily expecting an immediate payback from these investments but consider them to be important for the longer-term health of the business. Additionally, we are lapping bonus reversals last year, which are also a headwind to Q4 expense. Therefore, we expect SG&A to deleverage in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Third, we expect rent and occupancy to be more pressured in the fourth quarter due to preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship locations for both Gap and Old Navy scheduled to open in the back half of 2017. 
Given all of these factors, we continue to feel our guidance represents a prudent range. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. We expect the negative impact from the fire at our distribution center to be just over 1 POM [ph] point in the fourth quarter. Similar to Q3, the impact will be highest to Gap brand and lowest at Old Navy. 
Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 3%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of down 2%, driven by additional Gap store closures. 
Regarding our restructuring costs. We now estimate the full year impact to be between $0.42 and $0.46, down from our previous estimate of $0.45 to $0.50. 
All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

It's not as consistent as I would hope it is, and I see it across the whole industry right now. It is clearly she's refreshing her closet, but it's still not a strong dominant trend with super-new news out there. Obviously, with Gap, we're focused on that. Stretch in across all fabrications across the entire family is something that we're rapidly ramping up, both in the kids business as well as the adult business.

A couple of things to point out in terms of differences between Q3 and Q4, Lindsay. As we all know, Q4 tends to be much more promotional and competitive than Q3. And then this Q3, of course, was unique because we lost a lot of units in the fire, a lot of those units were fall fashion. So we were supertight on fashion in Q3, and that likely supported the nice outcome on margins. In contrast, in Q4, we didn't lose any holiday fashion in the fire. So we still have basics and seasonal basics that were lost and supposed to be sold, but none of our holiday, in any meaningful way, was lost. So we have more fashion in Q4 than we have in Q3. Now if traffic improves and we move the units as expected in the time we want it, at the velocity we want it, then all is going to be well. But as we mentioned, traffic has started out sort of stubborn and still challenged. And so I just sort of feel like, given those facts, it's too early to get overly optimistic, although, obviously, the teams will be driving toward that some improvement year-over-year. So that's the margin piece. With regards to the expense piece, there's lots of moving parts in expense. Marketing was actually only up $6 million. There were a bunch of other components, some of which are investments for the long term that the company has decided to make. Art mentioned, for example, the whole customer space and hiring a key customer officer and what comes with that. So we are starting to invest some. And then as I've been talking about for some time, since we're lapping many years of very tight expense management, it really gets super tough to try and leverage unless you have a very solid positive comp.

Now what we said at the time is, again, after years of very tight management, part of the reason we chose to do that restructuring is because it would help offset some of the natural inflation that you get running our business and would allow us to continue to be disciplined in our operating expenses. We are starting to make some decisions to make certain investments in the business. And I talked about 1 or 2 of those already in overhead and people -- in the form of people and also in marketing, especially in Q4.

Art can talk more about what we see under the covers, but certainly, it's encouraging to see that women, as the year has progressed, has been stronger than men.

Probably the most consistent theme, obviously, is continued FX pressure there. And Gap is more exposed to that, as you know, than any other business. If you look across the key pieces of the portfolio for Gap brand, the Japanese economy has obviously been challenging for everyone. We've seen some firming up of the business, I would describe, recently. But we have a long way to go there to get to the kind of performance we want to look at. I talked about China in my remarks. I won't really dwell on that. Continue to be optimistic in the long run, but it's been, I think, probably the most promotional time we've seen in that market since we've been present there with all development competitors, both local and nonlocal, breaking sale far earlier, having sale go deeper and longer than we've previously experienced, which indicates the misbalance of inventory and demand right now that's in that market. And then Europe continues to be Europe. We've announced, obviously, the actions that we've taken there in terms of closing some stores. We have a very good online business there. The specialty business, obviously, carries a very significant ROD on its P&L, and that's been an issue that we've had there for a long time. So it's a real mixed bag. And then in parts of the business in Canada, Canada's been very strong for us. It's been a very good business. So it's really a function of which market you're looking at."

We're still buying one category on a traditional pipeline, like outerwear, but in other categories like bottoms and knits, we've significantly improved the responsiveness of the category. We're making excellent progress. And really, more of the challenge right now is the operating model of the businesses and being able to exploit it. Demand-based buying, as an example, we're building tools against that right now versus doing it by brute force. It's more about the front end of the  business than really the back end of the business right now.

And we're actually doing some pretty -- pretty much -- pretty deep work right now on pricing. So it's something that's really on my mind. We did some work at Old Navy, which are now in the process of implementing, which highlighted some pretty material opportunity, and we're repeating that work inside of Gap brand as well. I guess, I'd highlight a couple of things if I look at denim. First of all, if you look at where we are from the standpoint of both our tickets and our actuals, we actually play in a pretty narrow range. If you think about denim where it is, denim is -- starts at an $8 entry-level price point, all the way up to multiple hundreds of dollars. And we, really across all of our brands, are very tightly banded. So I think there is a breadth of fabrication, good, better, best, if you want to think about it that way, The Gap has an opportunity to step up to in terms of product development. And that's probably biggest on my mind right now. The second issue is, is we have seen where we've been able to have pricing authority, but it hasn't been consistent enough. And that comes a bit with the quality of our buys. And it comes, I think, with making sure, again, that we're dialed in and on trend across the entire buy. I'm really focused on denim from a market share standpoint, and that's how we're thinking about it in the company. And I've been very pleased with what I've seen at Old Navy where we have been on a consistent posture of gaining market share in denim. And we're doing the work both in Banana and Gap to make sure that those businesses are moving forward that way as well. Again, if I reiterate it, probably the biggest opportunity as I see it is the breadth of our development and, therefore, how we straddle where demand sits in the marketplace right now from a price point standpoint. And we're pretty narrow relative to where I think we can play."

What I would tell you is that over the course of this year, as you all know, from comp reporting and our sales reporting, Banana has had the most pressure over the last little while.

Dana, I would say that we're -- let me step back for a second, and I'll just simplistically characterize the work that we're doing, which is we've operated this company historically more as independent businesses with relatively separate but duplicative activities inside of each business, not entirely because we had a common sourcing structure, a common IT platform, et cetera. But in a lot of other places, it's been relatively more independent. And the work that we're doing right now is to really build on sort of the core operating platform by bringing all of those things together that are not customer-facing and then skinning that operating platform where it faces the customer and the brand needs to be expressed. And I've talked about that before, and that is a process that is under way right now. And we're certainly doing that from a product standpoint. We moved first in terms of product a few years ago when we moved away from a geographic-based sourcing network to a category-based sourcing network. So that there's one office doing denim for every brand on behalf of the company where we can then bring to bear our scale working with mills and vendors in order to get the best possible cost and the best possible quality simultaneously. It's been a bit mixed inside of other things as well. I think we have an opportunity, especially in the environment we're in right now, from the standpoint of real estate and our relationship with our landlords. And then there's just a wide variety of costs, some media that we buy and have bought separately we're bringing together, et cetera. So I'd like to -- I'd love to tell you and give you an exact number. It is material, and it will continue to progressively pay it out. I mean, I've been very clear with the company on this one that I want this done. I want it done ASAP. I want the benefits in hand.

Therefore, the decision to put marketing into Q4 and to make sure that we're budgeting marketing as we go forward as well, will really tell the story and tell the story about both the product being on brand and on trend but also about the restoration of quality, of fit, of technical attributes and those types of thing as well. I have a very strong conviction that successful brands today, our story led brands, it's all around us and you can see the ones that are telling the story and the ones that aren't. And we have a great story to tell. We've just been a little too quiet with Banana and Gap by design, but we've been quiet until we felt like the product merited telling the story. And that's really where my head is at right now. I think -- I will take the credit here for wanting to be conservative on marketing because I did not want to invite -- aggressively invite customers back into our stores until I felt like the product was going to be where it needed to be. On Gap brand, specifically, again, it's not perfect. But the clarity of presentation that you should see in our stores, where we've really tried to tighten up to a category merchandising, the trend that we have in our stores, and I asked the question the other day of all of our brands, I just sent a note out over the weekend as I was traveling and watching and listening to people. I said, ""Just tell me you all have velvet."" And we all actually have velvet, which is super on trend right now across every single one of our businesses, from Athleta, Old Navy, in the Intermix. I feel like we're in a better spot, and we're getting better season over season as well. So I am -- as I said before, I'm cautiously optimistic on Q4, and I will continue to be as we look into next year. Thank you."

I'm going to talk, as I have in all of the calls that we've had, really about both the long game and the short game. And let me start continuing to address the strategy and many of the things that I've been talking to about and give you an update on where we are there but then also, obviously, a deeper dive into Q3 and the prospects that I see as we look into this holiday period and Q4. 
We are, I would say, well into transforming and rebuilding parts of this company, starting with our product model. And I've talked to you about the work that we've been doing to enhance our response in this across all of our brands and in key categories to pivot towards a much more continuous and demand-based buying process, to test our products in advance of the buys that we're placing, to go into season open, et cetera, and I continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making but also acknowledging the fact that this is a journey, and there remains significant work in front of us. 
First and foremost, we need to win on product. And as I looked into Q4, I am feeling very good about the product that we have in our stores across all of our brands. Obviously, the consumers will tell us how well we are doing and how well we did with the products after we hindsight the season, but if I look across all of the businesses, I feel like we're in the best place that we've been now for several seasons, where we are lined up against trend, where we have consistent quality appropriate to the brands, where we've gotten our fit dialed into the point where it is consistent and where each brand is showing up expressing the DNA and the fingerprints of the brand. 
Second thing that I've talked about is the fact that we are heads down focused on wringing every penny out of places where we have scale advantage, and that is obviously both on the product side of the equation but on the several billion dollars elsewhere in the company where we purchase a wide variety of things. And that is work that is not done, but it is work that is significantly under way and, again, work that I think has very significant payoff over the medium term. 
The third thing that I've spent time talking about is innovation in products. And again, we're in the early days of innovation in the ready-to-wear space, but already, there is good evidence of how we can crossruff innovation from the active side of the business into the ready-to-wear business and create meaningful benefits and have consumers connect with those product benefits in our ready-to-wear product. A good example of this is the Sculptek product that Athleta introduced a few months ago, performing very well in Athleta stores as a compression shaping product. It's also a proprietary fiber, and now we are moving to pull that into other bottoms fabrications, including denim and twill fabrications. And the properties that, that allows us to deliver in what is a traditional denim fabrication are actually quite extraordinary. And so as we get this up and running, I'm continuing to be very encouraged by how our consumers are responding to it, how we're delivering things beyond just trend to make the benefits of that product very meaningful to them. 
Demand-based buying is a critical piece and, again, to refresh your perspective, we and many others have traditionally bought the year one season on a grand reveal at a time. And that means making large commitments well in advance of when the product is going to be in the store and well in advance of knowing what the consumer really wants. So as we have been building the responsive supply chain capabilities, we have been also then reengineering the front end of the business so that we can buy on a much more continuous basis, in many cases, every month versus on a quarterly basis. And again, this brings several benefits. We remain open as we get closer to the season and can pivot to buy to the most meaningful trends in fabrications. But also, we are delivering newness constantly into our stores, which we know that our customers respond to. 
Outside of the product initiatives, we've also talked about CRM and about the customer and about data and about personalization and about technology. And we are not letting up on the throttle as we go after those areas as well. And you may have noted that in the last few months, I created a new role in the company led by a Chief Customer Officer who also has strategy. And that's really focused on bringing together every aspect of the customer across data, consumer insights, digital touch points and in-store experiences to create a holistic 360 view of the customer from which we can deliver meaningful benefits to that customer, whether they're benefits around loyalty, around personalization, around in-store experience and digital experience. 
Mobile obviously remains incredibly important, and we continue to see customers move from a desktop or a laptop experience to not just doing business on their mobile device but really engaging the brand on their mobile device. And as a consequence, we continue to put aggressive efforts against the mobile space. Some of it is just the basics but really important basics like continuing to improve site speed, how fast our pages load, allowing the mobile site to process a variety of forms of rich content that the consumer increasingly expects to have. We see mobile as fundamentally where our consumer starts and oftentimes ends their journey, and we need to make sure that we have a mobile experience that is commensurate with every other quality touch point that we have with our brands. 
Let me move to China for a second because it's fresh in my mind as I came back from a trip there just a week ago. I am very bullish on the long-term opportunity in China, and while I will acknowledge that the fact that the economy has cooled somewhat and the consumer is a little more cautious there has probably impacted everybody's business, it has not impacted my enthusiasm for the long-term potential in that market. We executed a strategy in Old Navy a couple of years ago where we put in place a number of stores across different types of locations, and different store sizes, and we've been working that footprint now for the last several months in order to refine the four-wall model. 
Secondly, obviously, Gap was the business that we planted there first both in the specialty stores and the Gap factory stores, and we continue to see that the customer resonates to that brand and wants to participate in that brand. And third, the Chinese consumer is fundamentally an omni-channel consumer, and I remain very enthusiastic around an online business that has a significant penetration into the retail business and has very attractive economics. 
A moment on Q3. And obviously, Sabrina will take you deeper into the numbers. First of all, I'd say the retail environment and the apparel environment continues to be challenging. Traffic remains challenging, and as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well. We feel that it's appropriate to plan for that. Obviously, we're doing work to try to beat that trend, but we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging as we look forward. Given that, I'm actually pretty pleased with Q3 because I see positive momentum even against the backdrop of the Fishkill fire. And I won't go into the details of Fishkill. I will say just as a callout that I felt like our logistics team in this company did an extraordinary job of not missing a beat from the standpoint of rewiring our logistics network with our facility in the middle of the country and our facility on the West Coast and continuing to keep supply going into our stores on a very cost-efficient fashion. 
A quick perspective on Q4. I believe, as I said before, that we're well set up from the standpoint of the product and the assortment. Just as a sidebar again, we continue to move the needle in terms of customer-reported experience with fit and quality, which had been very intentional initiatives. I believe we've taken another step forward in the back half of the year and into Q4 on both of these dimensions. We're also putting marketing into the business in a way that we haven't over the last couple of years, with marketing both in BR and in Gap, including TV for Gap, and I'm excited because now is the time when we need to start filling the funnel with lapsed customers and new customers in order to buck the negative traffic trend. And while I've mentioned BR and Gap in terms of marketing, of course, Old Navy is lined up as they always are in Q4 with a strong marketing program, including the $100,000 a day giveaway for 8 days. 
So brand by brand, just a few comments. With Gap, right direction, continuing to show stronger women's performance that I'd like to call out because the core of that business obviously needs to be a strong women's business. 
In the kids assortment, we have a significant expression of licensed products, which I'm very excited about. We have not done a large licensing business, and particularly in Q4, we feel that has a lot of relevance. 
Old Navy, I think the numbers frankly speak for themselves, an excellent Q3, an exciting holiday campaign, strong marketing. I think if you walk into an Old Navy store right now, and I've spent a lot of time in those stores all around the country and all around the world, you will see incredible clarity of product message. You will see clear category presentations that are super easy to shop. That's the feedback that we get from our customer. 
You know the work that's been going on in Banana on quality and on aesthetic. Customer feedback is that both are significantly moving in the right direction. We have a holiday campaign, including a catalog, which we have not done for years. It is focused on reaching lapsed customers and new customers, and we believe we're set up to continue the improvement of the business there that we're seeing. 
Athleta, I've nothing but good things to say, quite honestly. Positioned obviously against a very strong trend that continues to have legs underneath it, and again, Athleta is an active business. Athleta is also a lifestyle business, and that's really the core of Athleta's positioning, that confluence of active and lifestyle, which their customers very much respond to. I haven't spoken about marketing in Athleta. We have a very connected customer there, the holiday campaign, Share Your Light, is a campaign that is focused on strong community engagement, which is really a place of strength for them. I expect Athleta to carry their momentum into Q4. I expect Athleta to continue to perform as we get into next year as well. Again, that confluence of lifestyle and performance is powerful. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago about Sabrina Simmons leaving the company, and then just a few days ago, about Teri List-Stoll joining as CFO. 
First on Teri, I've spent quite a bit of time getting to know her, time in stores, time with product, time across a variety of places in the business, and I'm really excited about her joining the team and the perspective that she brings from her experience. You'll obviously get more time to get to know her. Some of you may know her already, but I'm very excited about having her on the team and looking forward to her joining in January. 
Let me turn to Sabrina. She will be missed. I'm sure missed by you and most certainly missed by me and the team here. She's been an incredible partner to me. In her 9 years as CFO, she has obviously been very passionate about our capital structure, about our investment thesis and just an incredible contributor to the company and in our relationships with the investment community. In 15 years at the company, she's done nothing but perform in an exemplary fashion in every role, and so I will miss her. I want to thank her. I'm very appreciative that she will be here until the end of the fiscal year to facilitate a very orderly and structured transition. 
And with that, Sabrina, let me turn it over to you."

Comp sales we",575,"Thanks so much for your generous comments, Art. It's been a great 15-year run and a true privilege to serve the company and our shareholders. 
Now moving on to third quarter performance. Sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 2% versus last year. Comp sales were down 3%. We were pleased that third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points over last year, largely driven by Old Navy. Merchandise margins expanded 220 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. 
Moving to expenses. Third quarter total operating expenses were up $78 million to $1.1 billion, including about $35 million related to restructuring charges. Marketing expenses were up $6 million to $148 million. 
Regarding taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 45.2%. The higher rate was driven by the impact from our restructuring actions, primarily in Japan. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 5 percentage points lower. 
Turning to earnings. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.51. The nontax-related restructuring costs were about $30 million in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date nontax-related restructuring costs to about $180 million. Excluding the tax and nontax impact of restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with inventory down 4% year-over-year. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the fourth quarter to be down low single digits year-over-year. Our year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $415 million. 
Regarding capital expenditures and square footage. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $383 million versus $505 million last year. Square footage was down 2% compared with last year. 
With regard to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.87 to $1.92, excluding restructuring costs. 
A few things to note about the assumptions around our guidance. First, per published reports, industry traffic has decelerated November month-to-date. Second, as Art mentioned, given that challenging traffic trends have continued, we are investing meaningfully in marketing across our portfolio of brands during the holiday season. We are not necessarily expecting an immediate payback from these investments but consider them to be important for the longer-term health of the business. Additionally, we are lapping bonus reversals last year, which are also a headwind to Q4 expense. Therefore, we expect SG&A to deleverage in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Third, we expect rent and occupancy to be more pressured in the fourth quarter due to preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship locations for both Gap and Old Navy scheduled to open in the back half of 2017. 
Given all of these factors, we continue to feel our guidance represents a prudent range. 
Regarding other guidance metrics. We expect the negative impact from the fire at our distribution center to be just over 1 POM [ph] point in the fourth quarter. Similar to Q3, the impact will be highest to Gap brand and lowest at Old Navy. 
Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 3%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of down 2%, driven by additional Gap store closures. 
Regarding our restructuring costs. We now estimate the full year impact to be between $0.42 and $0.46, down from our previous estimate of $0.45 to $0.50. 
All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

It's not as consistent as I would hope it is, and I see it across the whole industry right now. It is clearly she's refreshing her closet, but it's still not a strong dominant trend with super-new news out there. Obviously, with Gap, we're focused on that. Stretch in across all fabrications across the entire family is something that we're rapidly ramping up, both in the kids business as well as the adult business.

A couple of things to point out in terms of differences between Q3 and Q4, Lindsay. As we all know, Q4 tends to be much more promotional and competitive than Q3. And then this Q3, of course, was unique because we lost a lot of units in the fire, a lot of those units were fall fashion. So we were supertight on fashion in Q3, and that likely supported the nice outcome on margins. In contrast, in Q4, we didn't lose any holiday fashion in the fire. So we still have basics and seasonal basics that were lost and supposed to be sold, but none of our holiday, in any meaningful way, was lost. So we have more fashion in Q4 than we have in Q3. Now if traffic improves and we move the units as expected in the time we want it, at the velocity we want it, then all is going to be well. But as we mentioned, traffic has started out sort of stubborn and still challenged. And so I just sort of feel like, given those facts, it's too early to get overly optimistic, although, obviously, the teams will be driving toward that some improvement year-over-year. So that's the margin piece. With regards to the expense piece, there's lots of moving parts in expense. Marketing was actually only up $6 million. There were a bunch of other components, some of which are investments for the long term that the company has decided to make. Art mentioned, for example, the whole customer space and hiring a key customer officer and what comes with that. So we are starting to invest some. And then as I've been talking about for some time, since we're lapping many years of very tight expense management, it really gets super tough to try and leverage unless you have a very solid positive comp.

Now what we said at the time is, again, after years of very tight management, part of the reason we chose to do that restructuring is because it would help offset some of the natural inflation that you get running our business and would allow us to continue to be disciplined in our operating expenses. We are starting to make some decisions to make certain investments in the business. And I talked about 1 or 2 of those already in overhead and people -- in the form of people and also in marketing, especially in Q4.

Art can talk more about what we see under the covers, but certainly, it's encouraging to see that women, as the year has progressed, has been stronger than men.

Probably the most consistent theme, obviously, is continued FX pressure there. And Gap is more exposed to that, as you know, than any other business. If you look across the key pieces of the portfolio for Gap brand, the Japanese economy has obviously been challenging for everyone. We've seen some firming up of the business, I would describe, recently. But we have a long way to go there to get to the kind of performance we want to look at. I talked about China in my remarks. I won't really dwell on that. Continue to be optimistic in the long run, but it's been, I think, probably the most promotional time we've seen in that market since we've been present there with all development competitors, both local and nonlocal, breaking sale far earlier, having sale go deeper and longer than we've previously experienced, which indicates the misbalance of inventory and demand right now that's in that market. And then Europe continues to be Europe. We've announced, obviously, the actions that we've taken there in terms of closing some stores. We have a very good online business there. The specialty business, obviously, carries a very significant ROD on its P&L, and that's been an issue that we've had there for a long time. So it's a real mixed bag. And then in parts of the business in Canada, Canada's been very strong for us. It's been a very good business. So it's really a function of which market you're looking at."

We're still buying one category on a traditional pipeline, like outerwear, but in other categories like bottoms and knits, we've significantly improved the responsiveness of the category. We're making excellent progress. And really, more of the challenge right now is the operating model of the businesses and being able to exploit it. Demand-based buying, as an example, we're building tools against that right now versus doing it by brute force. It's more about the front end of the  business than really the back end of the business right now.

And we're actually doing some pretty -- pretty much -- pretty deep work right now on pricing. So it's something that's really on my mind. We did some work at Old Navy, which are now in the process of implementing, which highlighted some pretty material opportunity, and we're repeating that work inside of Gap brand as well. I guess, I'd highlight a couple of things if I look at denim. First of all, if you look at where we are from the standpoint of both our tickets and our actuals, we actually play in a pretty narrow range. If you think about denim where it is, denim is -- starts at an $8 entry-level price point, all the way up to multiple hundreds of dollars. And we, really across all of our brands, are very tightly banded. So I think there is a breadth of fabrication, good, better, best, if you want to think about it that way, The Gap has an opportunity to step up to in terms of product development. And that's probably biggest on my mind right now. The second issue is, is we have seen where we've been able to have pricing authority, but it hasn't been consistent enough. And that comes a bit with the quality of our buys. And it comes, I think, with making sure, again, that we're dialed in and on trend across the entire buy. I'm really focused on denim from a market share standpoint, and that's how we're thinking about it in the company. And I've been very pleased with what I've seen at Old Navy where we have been on a consistent posture of gaining market share in denim. And we're doing the work both in Banana and Gap to make sure that those businesses are moving forward that way as well. Again, if I reiterate it, probably the biggest opportunity as I see it is the breadth of our development and, therefore, how we straddle where demand sits in the marketplace right now from a price point standpoint. And we're pretty narrow relative to where I think we can play."

What I would tell you is that over the course of this year, as you all know, from comp reporting and our sales reporting, Banana has had the most pressure over the last little while.

Dana, I would say that we're -- let me step back for a second, and I'll just simplistically characterize the work that we're doing, which is we've operated this company historically more as independent businesses with relatively separate but duplicative activities inside of each business, not entirely because we had a common sourcing structure, a common IT platform, et cetera. But in a lot of other places, it's been relatively more independent. And the work that we're doing right now is to really build on sort of the core operating platform by bringing all of those things together that are not customer-facing and then skinning that operating platform where it faces the customer and the brand needs to be expressed. And I've talked about that before, and that is a process that is under way right now. And we're certainly doing that from a product standpoint. We moved first in terms of product a few years ago when we moved away from a geographic-based sourcing network to a category-based sourcing network. So that there's one office doing denim for every brand on behalf of the company where we can then bring to bear our scale working with mills and vendors in order to get the best possible cost and the best possible quality simultaneously. It's been a bit mixed inside of other things as well. I think we have an opportunity, especially in the environment we're in right now, from the standpoint of real estate and our relationship with our landlords. And then there's just a wide variety of costs, some media that we buy and have bought separately we're bringing together, et cetera. So I'd like to -- I'd love to tell you and give you an exact number. It is material, and it will continue to progressively pay it out. I mean, I've been very clear with the company on this one that I want this done. I want it done ASAP. I want the benefits in hand.

Therefore, the decision to put marketing into Q4 and to make sure that we're budgeting marketing as we go forward as well, will really tell the story and tell the story about both the product being on brand and on trend but also about the restoration of quality, of fit, of technical attributes and those types of thing as well. I have a very strong conviction that successful brands today, our story led brands, it's all around us and you can see the ones that are telling the story and the ones that aren't. And we have a great story to tell. We've just been a little too quiet with Banana and Gap by design, but we've been quiet until we felt like the product merited telling the story. And that's really where my head is at right now. I think -- I will take the credit here for wanting to be conservative on marketing because I did not want to invite -- aggressively invite customers back into our stores until I felt like the product was going to be where it needed to be. On Gap brand, specifically, again, it's not perfect. But the clarity of presentation that you should see in our stores, where we've really tried to tighten up to a category merchandising, the trend that we have in our stores, and I asked the question the other day of all of our brands, I just sent a note out over the weekend as I was traveling and watching and listening to people. I said, ""Just tell me you all have velvet."" And we all actually have velvet, which is super on trend right now across every single one of our businesses, from Athleta, Old Navy, in the Intermix. I feel like we're in a better spot, and we're getting better season over season as well. So I am -- as I said before, I'm cautiously optimistic on Q4, and I will continue to be as we look into next year. Thank you."
