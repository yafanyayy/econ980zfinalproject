In addi",994,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. 
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our Materials Technologies business.  All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. 
I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results of this quarter. Despite significant global macro uncertainty and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our 5-point plan and delivered earnings of $1.78 per share, which is up 15% over last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees around the globe. I'd like to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal. 
However, I am disappointed in one aspect of our performance.  Please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance in this quarter was worse than previous year, and therefore, it is not acceptable. Our goal includes being the safest industrial gas company in the world. We have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure everyone goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee, and I have made it clear to everyone that our safety performance must improve.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our goal. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident with the refocus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives our long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is by most responsible -- my most important responsibility as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our strategic plan as we move forward. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of the focus on our 5-point plan that we discussed more -- and disclosed more than a year ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter, but wanted to make a few more comments. 
The first point in our plan is to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, they announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business, tax-free to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate stand-alone public company called the Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form-10 in September to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work to prepare for the spin. Most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong performance. We remain confident this transaction can be complete before September of 2016.
The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our costs. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We have a very robust and detailed process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level. And we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% in term of rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million in the year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next 4 years. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward, so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter.  Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by 500 basis points, increased free cash by $200 million, increased our earning per share by 15%, and return on capital employed is up 160 basis points to 11.7%. This is despite the weak worldwide economy, lower sales and an $0.08 negative impact from currency exchange translation.
And now if you please turn to Slide #8, which by the way is my favorite slide. You will see our progress over the last 2 years that we have improved our margins by more than 800 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve margins.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks. And then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 8% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 5% each. Volumes increased 1% as Gases Asia growth continued, while Materials Technologies and Gases Americas and Gases Europe volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more of that later.  Pricing was 1% higher for the fifth consecutive quarter, again driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe and both price increases of mix in Materials Technologies. 
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $786 million improved by 9%, and operating income improved by 17% despite the lower sales.  EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to 33.4%, while operating margin improved 460 basis points to 22%.  We saw margin improvement across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 60 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points resulted primarily from lower costs and higher prices. Our actions continue to show results, and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years.
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 15%. And we continued to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 160 basis points to 11.7%.
Now please turn to Slide 10. Seifi talked about safety and cash flow and that we did not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by $88 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA and slightly lower maintenance capital. We remain focused on spending the right amount of maintenance capital at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. 
As a result of lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $165 million this quarter or $199 million higher than prior year. That's a great start to fiscal 2016. We expect growth CapEx for FY '16 to be lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to the decision last quarter to suspend construction on the Tees Valley 2 projects. Please remember that from a timing perspective, it's not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.11 per share or $26 million pretax.
Back in November, we announced that we were suspending construction of Tees Valley 2 until certain design issues of Tees Valley 1 are better understood and can be integrated into the design of Tees Valley 2. In fiscal Q1, we incurred incremental costs of $14 million or $0.05 per share to suspend construction activities of the second project. We expect about another $0.02 of additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter.  
We also saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $12 million or $0.06 per share for legal and advisory fees. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. with the completion of our first phase, restructuring costs were modest this quarter and are included in our underlying results. Further details of all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and footnotes to over earnings release. 
Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.78 increased $0.23 per share or 15% versus last year despite the currency headwinds. Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.14. Net cost performance was $0.18 favorable, primarily due to the benefit from our actions taken last year to enable a new, more disciplined organization cost performance also included about a $0.03 benefit from lower pension costs.
Unfavorable currency was $0.08 per share as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. 
Equity affiliate income was $0.03 unfavorable. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to higher capital interest and retirement of higher cost debt last quarter. 
Taxes were $0.03 unfavorable due to the higher earnings and timing of a few items. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely close to the 25%. 
Noncontrolling interest was $0.02 favorable due to our buyout of the remaining shares of the Indura business last quarter. And higher shares outstanding reduced EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of the business segments results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."
248356,321331709,923623,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.First, I'd like to thank the entire Air Products team for another very strong quarter and step up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 45",1112,"Thanks, Scott.
First, I'd like to thank the entire Air Products team for another very strong quarter and step up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 450 basis points year-on-year. Going forward, we're going to drive operational productivity to new heights in Air Products, and we are going to work tirelessly to improve safety. 
In our highly distributed business, we often describe operational productivity as 10,000 little things. That means we have many opportunities to act, and our new simpler organization is helping us to act with speed.
For example, we used to have a bias to purchase on corporate global sole-source agreements. And that's a good strategy for some things, but not everything. In our new organization, an empowered regional team broke this paradigm. They decided to multisource. That meant we could introduce low cost local suppliers, and we could select the best supplier for each location. Our other regions are replicating this, and we would expect savings in the 40% range. 
We are also improving distribution routing and fleet efficiency by working with third parties to bring new ideas. We're improving operating and maintenance efficiency by using our data to adjust maintenance intervals and improving network efficiency by consolidating facilities. These are some of the 10,000 things.
With that, please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost drove the margin expansion. Sales of $836 million were down 17% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 12% and currency reduced sales by 4%. Volumes were down 3% on weakness in Latin America and in the North America steel and oil field services markets. Some steel customers idled capacity in December, which will have some impact on argon and oxygen volumes going forward. 
volumes and refinery operating rates remained strong. Pricing was up 2%, the fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas. We had particular success in South America in several specific products. 
Helium has been a strength for us, but oversupply in helium will likely begin to weaken pricing later this year. We expect the helium market to tighten again in a few years. 
Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year. And EBITDA of $335 million was up 1% as we overcame the headwinds from currency, lower energy pass-through and lower volumes through pricing, the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs.
Record operating margin of 25.3% was up 420 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 700 basis points. The impact from lower energy pass-through was about half of the margin improvement. Lower costs drove our sequential profit and margin improvement. We expect volume weakness to continue in Q2, particularly for steel in Latin America, but expect our cost focus will overcome higher major maintenance costs and drive improved profitability versus last year.
Now please turn to slide 13. For Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses, we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions as EBITDA and operating margin set new records, both up almost 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $438 million were down 12% due to a negative currency impact of 10%, primarily due to the euro, pound and Polish zloty and a negative 2% impact on lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were flat, with 1% lower volumes and 1% higher prices. Positive liquid bulk volumes were more than offset by lower package gases volumes in part due to weak offshore demand and by lower refinery hydrogen demand. Price was positive across all regions. 
Operating income of $92 million was up 13%, and operating margin of 20.9% was up 470 basis points. Operating income would have been up 22% on a constant-currency basis.  EBITDA of $146 million was up 2%, and EBITDA margin of 33.3% was up 480 basis points. The primary driver of improved profitability was our continued focus on costs and a positive contribution from our pricing actions.
Please turn to Slide 14, Gases Asia. As you can see from our results, our business performance was very strong again this quarter, with record operating and EBITDA margins. Despite all the talk about China, we did well in China. Of course, we expect our China tonnage volumes to be up with the new plants onstream, but merchant volumes were up also again. 
We remain cautious about the economic outlook in Asia, but are pleased with the resilience our business has demonstrated. Sales of $413 million was up 4%, primarily driven by volumes up 11%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall merchant volumes were up low double digits again across Asia, with China LOX/LIN volumes also up low double digits. We're pleased to finally bring onstream the largest projects that Air Products has ever built, providing oxygen to in Yulin, China. We now have 6 large oxygen for coal gasification projects onstream in China, including over 20,000 tons a day of oxygen added this last year. 
Our customers are operating their facilities. Our plants are running well, and we are getting paid. As I've mentioned in the past, we do occasionally see swings in the energy pass-through around customers start-ups. This has no impact on profit but can impact sales and margins.
Sequentially, volumes were down 3%, in part due to a positive catch-up payment in Q4 that I mentioned last quarter. Pricing was down 2% on the continued overcapacity in the China liquid market. 
Operating income of $117 million was up 29%, and operating margin of 28.2% was up 550 basis points. EBITDA of $180 million was up 16%, and EBITDA margin of 43.6% was up 480 basis points.
Profit improvement was driven by the base business volume growth, new projects successfully coming onstream and a benefit of our cost reduction programs and about $5 million of nonrecurring items. The team is very focused on continuing to drive improvement, but we expect some volume weakness from the lunar new year next quarter.
I'll close with a comment on global gases segment. You'll recall that this is the segment that includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with industrial gas business, which are not region-specific. Sales were up as we began to recognize revenue from the sale of ASU equipment that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales.
Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

Please turn to Slide 15. Let me start with a few general comments before I go into the numbers. In September of last year, Air Products announced its intention to separate Materials Technologies business through a spin-off to our shareholders. The strategic decision will allow Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long term. 
The new company will be called Versum Materials and will be highly profitable, with strong cash flow generation and solid growth prospects.  Our team is very excited about this tremendous opportunity. And as you can see from the strong results, we remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. We're also making good progress on key steps required to enable the spin-off, which we expect to be completed for September of 2016. For example, in December, we submitted initial draft of our Form 10.
On February 24, George  , Versum's future CFO, Simon and I plan to host a conference call to help you understand our business including our key markets products as well as our plans for future success.  Given the progress we have made in the spin-off process and the level of financial information we have provided, you will see we are sharing more details about our business.
I will first make a few comments on our overall Materials Technologies segment, and then make more specific comments on electronic materials and Performance Materials results for the quarter.  Segment sales of $490 million were down 6% versus last year, including a negative 2% currency impact. As a reminder for materials technology, currency volatility has a greater impact on our business than on the industrial gas business of Air Products. Given the global nature of our supply network, we have both transformational and transactional impact from currency, more so for Performance Materials where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe and Latin America.
Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower demand in performance materials. Pricing was up 2%.
EBITDA of $147 million was up 14%, and EBITDA margins were up 530 basis points. Operating income of $127 million was up 22%, and operating margin of 26% was up 600 basis points, another record margin quarter driven by cost reduction actions and the management of price versus raw materials. Most importantly, we bounced back very well from a softer fourth quarter.
As I told you last quarter, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015, and we're still committed to this. We're off to a great start in the first quarter, but are somewhat cautious of the second quarter given the decline in the delivery systems activity that I mentioned before and the weak macroeconomic environment impacting demand, continued currency headwinds and the impact of lower raw material costs in our inventories. But as you know, the second half of the year is typically the stronger part of the year for our business.
On Slide 16, you can see the results of electronic materials. Sales of $245 million were down 4% on lower volumes, improved pricing and mix and negative currency effects. As expected, delivery system activity was down significantly. Despite key products in our PM portfolio being capacity constrained, our overall materials volumes were flat as we continued to see strong demand in Advanced Materials business. It's a great example of innovation that continues to be at the core of our organic growth and of the future products and solutions for our customers. 
For electronic materials, EBITDA of $96 million was up 27%, and EBITDA margins of 39.2% was up almost 1,000 basis points. Operating income of $83 million was up 43%, and margins of 33.9% was up over 1,000 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our cost reduction actions were the key drivers. The quarter also benefited from the timing impact of portfolio actions we have taken. These are worth about 200 basis points. The rest of the 800 basis point improvement is from underlying business performance.
On Slide 17, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 9% on lower volumes, lower prices and negative currency effects. Volumes were down in additives business, driven by the global demand in general and in particular, weakness in oil and gas and Mining markets. This includes a specific customer shutdown in Brazil.  Prices were down, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs. 
Performance Materials EBITDA of $51 million was down 7%, but margins of 20.9% was up 50 basis points. Operating income of $44 million was down 7%, but margins of 18% was up 30 basis points. The lower volumes and the negative impact of currency more than offset the benefits of pricing relative to raw materials and the cost reduction actions.
On Slide 18, you can see the trailing 12-month results from Materials Technologies segment: sales of just over $2 billion, EBITDA of $590 million with margins of 28.7%, and operating income of almost $500 million with margins of 24.3%. This is as reported in Air Products and does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, materials will be a very high quality company with very attractive margins.
Slide 19 shows the operating margin improvement in Materials Technologies over the last 3 years. Although recent market dynamics have been favorable for a few products, the overall performance was not driven by a cyclical peak as the business environment varied significantly over this period of time. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts over the last 3 years: innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven by -- in part by macroeconomic drivers, we do not see this as a cyclical business. The semiconductor industry has changed, and the underlying improvements we have made in process materials is sustainable.
As I indicated in the past, we are capacity-constrained in several product lines, and we are launching several new products in Advanced Materials, all of which require us to expand capacity. We continued to make good progress on the capital projects I talked about in the last 2 earnings calls.  As you saw from the initial draft Form 10, the spending on these expansion project increased total CapEx to about $100 million in fiscal year '15. We expect fiscal year '16 CapEx to be about $200 million before it goes back down to more typical levels of below $100 million for fiscal year '17.
Keep in mind that we only make these types of large capital investments every few years. In fact, the last one was 8 years ago. As I said, Versum will generate very strong cash flows.
We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. And equally important, we are committed to meeting or exceeding our time line for the spin-off of Materials Technologies business as a stand-alone company. I know that I can speak for the entire team that we are committing to adding value to our customers, to the success of the business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders. Again, I look forward to sharing more information with you on our call on February 24.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the corporate segment."

Sales were flat versus last year as higher LNG sales were offset by higher helium containers sales. LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY '16 results. The improved profitability this quarter is partly driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs.

Now please turn to Slide #20 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on the things we can control towards our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. At the midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.26 or 16% over the second quarter of last year and would represent our second consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background and increased currency headwinds, we are confident in delivering on and on maintaining our full year of fiscal year 2016 guidance of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At midpoint, this will be a 12% increase over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. The full year and quarter guidance include the material technology business as part of Air Products for the full 2016.
Primarily as a result of our decision to suspend construction of Tees Valley 2 project, we now expect our CapEx to be about $1.3 billion for the year, down about 25% from fiscal year 2015.
As you can see from our results, we improved free cash flow by $200 million this quarter. You have heard me talk about priorities for the use of cash we generate, and I would like to reiterate them in the order of priority. Our #1 priority is to maintain an A rating, an A credit rating. Number two, we have to use our cash to invest in good projects and good and accretive acquisitions. Number three, we will continue to increase our dividends. And number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. The cash we generate belongs to the shareholders, and the only spend on cash if we have enough high return projects and acquisitions. Otherwise as I have said, we would return it to our shareholders.
Air Products' growth into the future will not be driven by any single large event. I'm confident we will deliver on our commitment to spin Materials Technologies and we will resolve our energy from base business in northern England. 
Our future growth and profit growth will be driven by executing on the basics of our industrial gas business. That is, we will focus on all aspects of growth in our Industrial Gases. We will deliver the second $300 million of cost savings over the next few years, enabled by the more focused and accountable organization we already have in place. We will deliver on projects in our backlog, and we will compete for and win new projects at high return. 
We certainly understand there is significant uncertainty in the world today, but we are focused on the things we control to drive improvement. We believe in self-help, regardless of external environment. The future is very bright for industrial gases business in general, and most importantly for Air Products. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change. And we are blessed with having great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 170,000 outstanding customers to serve. I am very proud of our people, incredibly optimistic about the future of Air Products and consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.

I think in the last 2 calls, we already predicted that this -- the delivery systems, the equipment business was going to be slowing down versus prior year. A lot of it was the projects we did last year. So our delta was probably more driven from that project differential. Now if you look at a lot of them projections and this has been how the actual demand has been tracking from a lot of the third party industry -- the projection was for a softening in CapEx. That would start to pick up in the back end of 2016, and we're still tracking that. So it hasn't been a big surprise for us. Regarding the inventory revamp, this is why I'm a little bit cautious for the second quarter. Not that we're seeing a big change in dynamics versus what we project in the past, but in the near term, the headwinds of currency, oil price deflation and the impact it's having on our price that we should have some inventory revamp. But also on the demand side, a lot of our customers, unlike gases, we have inventory. customers have inventory. And some of the demand softness that we're seeing is just people taking actions on their inventory levels."

First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our Materials Technologies business.  All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. 
I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite significant global macro uncertainty and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our 5-point plan and delivered earnings of $1.78 per share, which is up 15% over last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees around the globe. I'd like to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal. 
However, I am disappointed in one aspect of our performance.  Please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance this quarter was worse than previous year, and therefore, it is not acceptable. Our goal includes being the safest industrial gas company in the world. We have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure everyone goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee, and I have made it very clear to everyone that our safety performance must improve.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our goal. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we will refocus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is my most responsible -- my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our strategic plan as we move forward. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of the focus on our 5-point plan that we discussed more -- and disclosed more than a year ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter but wanted to make a few more comments. 
The first point in our plan is to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business, tax-free, to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate stand-alone public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form-10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work to prepare for the spin. Most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong performance. We remain confident this transaction will be complete before September of 2016.
The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We have a very robust and detailed process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level, and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% in term of rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million in the year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next 4 years. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work in -- the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward, so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by 500 basis points, increased free cash by $200 million, increased our earning per share by 15%, and return on capital employed is up 160 basis points to 11.7%. This is despite the world -- the weak worldwide economy, lower sales and an $0.08 negative impact from currency exchange translation.
And now if you'll please turn to Slide #8, which, by the way, is my favorite slide. You will see our progress over the last 2 years, where we have improved our margins by more than 800 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,321331709,923757,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi.Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results.

Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 8% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 5% each. Volumes increased 1% as Gases Asia growth continued, while Materials Technologies and Gases Americas and Gases Europe volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later. Pricing was 1% higher for the fifth consecutive quarter, again driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe and both price increases of mix in Materials Technologies. 
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $786 million improved by 9%, and operating income improved by 17% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to 33.4%, while operating margin improved 460 basis points to 22%. We saw margin improvement across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 60 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points resulted primarily from lower costs and higher prices. Our actions continue to show results, and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years.
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 15%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 160 basis points to 11.7%.
Now please turn to Slide 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on and cash flow and that we did not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by $88 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA and slightly lower maintenance capital. We remain focused on spending the right amount of maintenance capital at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. 
As a result of lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $165 million this quarter or $199 million higher than prior year. That's a great start to fiscal 2016. We expect growth CapEx for FY '16 to be lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to the decision last quarter to suspend construction on the Tees Valley 2 projects. Please remember that from a timing perspective, it's not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.11 per share or $26 million pretax.
Back in November, we announced that we were suspending construction of Tees Valley 2 until certain design issues of Tees Valley 1 are better understood and can be integrated into the design of Tees Valley 2. In fiscal Q1, we incurred incremental costs of $14 million or $0.05 per share to suspend construction activities of the second project. We expect about another $0.02 of additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter.  
We also saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $12 million or $0.06 per share for legal and advisory fees. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. With the completion of our first phase, restructuring costs were modest this quarter and are included in our underlying results. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. 
Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.78 increased $0.23 per share or 15% versus last year despite the currency headwinds. Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.14. Net cost performance was $0.18 favorable, primarily due to the benefit from our actions taken last year to enable a new, more disciplined organization. Cost performance also included about a $0.03 benefit from lower pension costs.
Unfavorable currency was $0.08 per share, as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. 
Equity affiliate income was $0.03 unfavorable. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to higher capitalized interest and the retirement of higher-cost Indura debt last quarter. 
Taxes were $0.03 unfavorable due to higher earnings and timing of a few items. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely close to the 25%. 
Noncontrolling interest was $0.02 favorable due to our buyout of the remaining shares of the Indura business last quarter. And higher shares outstanding reduced EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segments results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."
248356,321331709,923757,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.First, I'd like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step-up in our margins.

First, I'd like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step-up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 450 basis points year-on-year. Going forward, we're going to drive operational productivity to new heights at Air Products, and we are going to work tirelessly to improve safety. 
In our highly distributed business, we often describe operational productivity as 10,000 little things. That means we have many opportunities to act, and our new, simpler organization is helping us to act with speed.
For example, we used to have a bias to purchase on corporate, global, sole-source agreements. And that's a good strategy for some things, but not everything. In our new organization, an empowered regional team broke this paradigm. They decided to multisource. That meant we could introduce low-cost local suppliers, and we could select the best supplier for each location. Our other regions are replicating this, and we would expect savings in the 40% range. 
We are also improving distribution routing and fleet efficiency by working with third parties to bring new ideas. We're improving operating and maintenance efficiency by using our data to adjust maintenance intervals and improving network efficiency by consolidating facilities. These are some of the 10,000 things.
With that, please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost drove the margin expansion. Sales of $836 million were down 17% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 12% and currency reduced sales by 4%. Volumes were down 3% on weakness in Latin America and in the North America steel and oil field services markets. Some steel customers idled capacity in December, which will have some impact on argon and oxygen volumes going forward. 
HyCO volumes and refinery operating rates remained strong. Pricing was up 2%, the fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas. We had particular success in South America in several specific products. 
Helium has been a strength for us, but oversupply in helium will likely begin to weaken pricing later this year. We expect the helium market to tighten again in a few years. 
Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year. And EBITDA of $335 million was up 1% as we overcame the headwinds from currency, lower energy pass-through and lower volumes through pricing, the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs.
Record operating margin of 25.3% was up 420 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 700 basis points. The impact from lower energy pass-through was about half of the margin improvement. Lower costs drove our sequential profit and margin improvement. We expect volume weakness to continue in Q2, particularly for steel in Latin America, but expect our cost focus will overcome higher major maintenance costs and drive improved profitability versus last year.
Now please turn to slide 13. For Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses, we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions, as EBITDA and operating margin set new records, both up almost 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $438 million were down 12% due to a negative currency impact of 10%, primarily due to the euro, pound and Polish zloty, and a negative 2% impact on lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were flat, with 1% lower volumes and 1% higher prices. Positive liquid bulk volumes were more than offset by lower package gases volumes, in part due to weak offshore demand and by lower refinery hydrogen demand. Price was positive across all regions. 
Operating income of $92 million was up 13%, and operating margin of 20.9% was up 470 basis points. Operating income would have been up 22% on a constant-currency basis. EBITDA of $146 million was up 2%, and EBITDA margin of 33.3% was up 480 basis points. The primary driver of improved profitability was our continued focus on costs and a positive contribution from our pricing actions.
Please turn to Slide 14, Gases Asia. As you could see from our results, our business performance was very strong again this quarter, with record operating and EBITDA margins. Despite all the talk about China, we did well in China. Of course, we expect our China tonnage volumes to be up with the new plants onstream, but merchant volumes were up also again. 
We remain cautious about the economic outlook in Asia, but are pleased with the resilience our business has demonstrated. Sales of $413 million was up 4%, primarily driven by volumes up 11%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall merchant volumes were up low double digits again across Asia, with China LOX/LIN volumes also up low double digits. We are pleased to fully bring onstream the largest ASU project that Air Products has ever built, providing oxygen to Yankuang in Yulin, China. We now have 6 large oxygen for coal gasification projects onstream in China, including over 20,000 tons a day of oxygen added this last year. 
Our customers are operating their facilities. Our plants are running well, and we are getting paid. As I've mentioned in the past, we do occasionally see swings in the energy pass-through around customer start-ups. This has no impact on profit but can impact sales and margins.
Sequentially, volumes were down 3%, in part due to a positive catch-up payment in Q4 that I mentioned last quarter. Pricing was down 2% on the continued overcapacity in the China liquid market. 
Operating income of $117 million was up 29%, and operating margin of 28.2% was up 550 basis points. EBITDA of $180 million was up 16%, and EBITDA margin of 43.6% was up 480 basis points.
Profit improvement was driven by the base business volume growth, new projects successfully coming onstream and the benefit of our cost reduction programs and about $5 million of nonrecurring items. The team is very focused on continuing to drive improvement, but we would expect some volume weakness from the lunar new year next quarter.
I'll close with a comment on global gases segment. You'll recall that this is the segment that includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region-specific. Sales were up as we began to recognize revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales.
Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."
248356,321331709,923757,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Corning.

Please turn to Slide 15. Let me start with a few general comments before I go into the numbers. In September of last year, Air Products announced its intention to separate Materials Technologies business through a spin-off to our shareholders. This strategic decision will allow Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long term. 
The new company will be called Versum Materials and will be highly profitable with strong cash flow generation and solid growth prospects. Our team is very excited about this tremendous opportunity. And as you can see from our strong results, we remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. We're also making good progress on key steps required to enable the spin-off, which we expect to be completed before September of 2016. For example, in December, we submitted initial draft of our Form 10.
On February 24, George Bitto, Versum's future CFO, Simon and I plan to host a conference call to help you understand our business including our key markets products as well as our plans for future success. Given the progress we have made in the spin-off process and the level of financial information we have provided, you will see we are sharing more details about our business.
I will first make a few comments on our overall Materials Technologies segment, and then make more specific comments on electronic materials and Performance Materials results for the quarter. Segment sales of $490 million were down 6% versus last year, including a negative 2% currency impact. As a reminder, for materials technology, currency volatility has a greater impact on our business than on the industrial gas business of Air Products. Given the global nature of our supply network, we have both translational and transactional impact from currency, but more so for Performance Materials, where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe and Latin America.
Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower demand in Performance Materials. Pricing was up 2%.
EBITDA of $147 million was up 14%, and EBITDA margins were up 530 basis points. Operating income of $127 million was up 22%, and operating margins of 26% was up 600 basis points. Another record margin quarter driven by cost reduction actions and the management of price versus raw materials. Most importantly, we bounced back very well from a softer fourth quarter.
As I told you last quarter, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015, and we're still committed to this. We're off to a great start in the first quarter but are somewhat cautious of the second quarter, given the decline in the delivery systems activity that I mentioned before and the weak macroeconomic environment impacting demand, continued currency headwinds and the impact of lower raw material costs on our inventories. But as you know, the second half of the year is typically the stronger part of the year for our business.
On Slide 16, you can see the results of Electronic Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 4% on lower volumes, improved pricing and mix and negative currency effect. As expected, delivery system activity was down significantly. Despite key products in our PM portfolio being capacity-constrained, our overall materials volumes were flat, as we continue to see strong demand in Advanced Materials business. It's a great example of innovation that continues to be at the core of our organic growth and of the future products and solutions for our customers. 
For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $96 million was up 27%, and EBITDA margins of 39.2% was up almost 1,000 basis points. Operating income of $83 million was up 43%, and margins of 33.9% was up over 1,000 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our cost reduction actions were the key drivers. The quarter also benefited from the timing impact of portfolio actions we have taken. These are worth about 200 basis points. The rest of the 800 basis point improvement is from underlying business performance.
On Slide 17, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 9% on lower volumes, lower prices and negative currency effect. Volumes were down in epoxy and additives business, driven by weak global demand in general, and in particular, weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. This includes a specific customer shutdown in Brazil. Prices were down but were more than offset by lower raw material costs. 
Performance Materials EBITDA of $51 million was down 7%, but margins of 20.9% was up 50 basis points. Operating income of $44 million was down 7%, but margins of 18% was up 30 basis points. The lower volumes and the negative impact of currency more than offset the benefits of pricing relative to raw materials and the cost reduction actions.
On Slide 18, you can see the trailing 12-month results from Materials Technologies segment: sales of just over $2 billion, EBITDA of $590 million with margins of 28.7% and operating income of almost $500 million with margins of 24.3%. This is as reported within Air Products and does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, Versum Materials will be a very high-quality company with very attractive margins.
Slide 19 shows the operating margin improvement in Materials Technologies over the last 3 years. Although recent market dynamics have been favorable for a few products, the overall performance was not driven by a cyclical peak, as the business environment varied significantly over this period of time. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts over the last 3 years: innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven by -- in part by macroeconomic drivers, we do not see this as a cyclical business. The semiconductor industry has changed, and the underlying improvements we have made in Process Materials is sustainable.
As I indicated in the past, we are capacity-constrained in several product lines, and we are launching several new products in Advanced Materials, all of which require us to expand capacity. We continue to make good progress on the capital projects I talked about in our last 2 earnings calls. As you saw from the initial draft Form 10, the spending on these expansion project increased total CapEx to about $100 million in fiscal year '15. We expect fiscal year '16 CapEx to be about $200 million before it drops back down to more typical levels of below $100 million for fiscal year '17.
Keep in mind that we only make these types of large capital investments every few years. In fact, the last one was 8 years ago. As I said, Versum will generate very strong cash flows.
We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. And equally important, we are committed to meeting or exceeding our time line for the spin-off of Materials Technologies business as a stand-alone company. I know that I can speak for the entire team that we are committing to adding value to our customers, to the success of the business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders. Again, I look forward to sharing more information with you on our call on February 24.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the corporate segment."

Our corporate segment consists of our energy and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were flat versus last year as higher LNG sales were offset by lower helium containers sales. LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY '16 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs.

Now please turn to Slide #20 for the discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on the things we can control towards our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.26 or 16% over the second quarter of last year and would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background and increased currency headwinds, we are confident in delivering on and on maintaining our full year of fiscal year 2016 guidance of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At midpoint, this will be a 12% increase over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. The full year and quarterly guidance include the Materials Technologies business as part of Air Products for the full 2016.
Primarily as a result of our decision to suspend construction of Tees Valley 2 project, we now expect our CapEx to be about $1.3 billion for the year, down about 25% from fiscal year 2015.
As you can see from our results, we improved free cash flow by $200 million this quarter. You have heard me talk about priorities for the use of cash we generate, and I would like to reiterate them in the order of priority. Our #1 priority is to maintain an A rating -- an A credit rating. Number two, we will use our cash to invest in good projects and good and accretive acquisitions. Number three, we will continue to increase our dividends. And number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. The cash we generate belongs to the shareholders, and we only spend our cash if we have enough high-return projects and acquisitions. Otherwise, as I have said, we would return it to our shareholders.
Air Products' growth into the future will not be driven by any single large event. I'm confident we will deliver on our commitment to spin Materials Technologies and we will resolve our Energy-from-Waste business in Northern England. 
Our future growth and profit growth will be driven by executing on the basics of our industrial gas business. That is, we will focus on all aspects of growth in our Industrial Gases. We will deliver the second $300 million of cost savings over the next few years, enabled by the more focused and accountable organization we already have in place. We will deliver on projects in our backlog, and we will compete for and win new projects at high return. 
We certainly understand there is significant uncertainty in the world today, but we are focused on the things we control to drive improvement. We believe in self-help, regardless of the external environment. The future is very bright for Industrial Gases business in general, and most importantly for Air Products. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change, and we are blessed with having a great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 170,000 outstanding customers to serve. I am very proud of our people, incredibly optimistic about the future of Air Products and consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.

I think, in the last 2 calls, we already predicted that this -- the delivery systems, the equipment business was going to be slowing down versus prior year. A lot of it was because of some projects that we did last year. So our delta was probably more driven from that project differential. Now if you look at a lot of the projections, and this has been how the actual demand has been tracking from a lot of the third-party industry, the projection was for a softening in CapEx. That would start to pick up in the back end of 2016, and we're still tracking that. So it hasn't been a big surprise for us. Regarding the inventory reval, this is why I'm a little bit more cautious for the second quarter. Not that we're seeing a big change in dynamics versus what we'd projected in the past, but in the near term, the headwinds of currency, oil price deflation and the impact it's having on our prices that we should have some inventory reval.

Another quarter of outstanding performance is due to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees around the globe. I'd like to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal. 
However, I am disappointed in one aspect of our performance.  Please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance this quarter was worse than previous year, and therefore, it is not acceptable. Our goal includes being the safest industrial gas company in the world. We have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure everyone goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee, and I have made it very clear to everyone that our safety performance must improve.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our goal. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we will refocus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is my most responsible -- my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our strategic plan as we move forward. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of the focus on our 5-point plan that we discussed more -- and disclosed more than a year ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter but wanted to make a few more comments. 
The first point in our plan is to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business, tax-free, to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate stand-alone public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form-10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work to prepare for the spin. Most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong performance. We remain confident this transaction will be complete before September of 2016.
The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We have a very robust and detailed process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level, and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% in term of rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million in the year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next 4 years. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work in -- the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward, so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by 500 basis points, increased free cash by $200 million, increased our earning per share by 15%, and return on capital employed is up 160 basis points to 11.7%. This is despite the world -- the weak worldwide economy, lower sales and an $0.08 negative impact from currency exchange translation.
And now if you'll please turn to Slide #8, which, by the way, is my favorite slide. You will see our progress over the last 2 years, where we have improved our margins by more than 800 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 8% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 5% each. Volumes increased 1% as Gases Asia growth continued, while Materials Technologies and Gases Americas and Gases Europe volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later. Pricing was 1% higher for the fifth consecutive quarter, again driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe and both price increases of mix in Materials Technologies. 
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $786 million improved by 9%, and operating income improved by 17% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to 33.4%, while operating margin improved 460 basis points to 22%. We saw margin improvement across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 60 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points resulted primarily from lower costs and higher prices. Our actions continue to show results, and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years.
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 15%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 160 basis points to 11.7%.
Now please turn to Slide 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on and cash flow and that we did not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by $88 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA and slightly lower maintenance capital. We remain focused on spending the right amount of maintenance capital at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. 
As a result of lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $165 million this quarter or $199 million higher than prior year. That's a great start to fiscal 2016. We expect growth CapEx for FY '16 to be lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to the decision last quarter to suspend construction on the Tees Valley 2 projects. Please remember that from a timing perspective, it's not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.11 per share or $26 million pretax.
Back in November, we announced that we were suspending construction of Tees Valley 2 until certain design issues of Tees Valley 1 are better understood and can be integrated into the design of Tees Valley 2. In fiscal Q1, we incurred incremental costs of $14 million or $0.05 per share to suspend construction activities of the second project. We expect about another $0.02 of additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter.  
We also saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $12 million or $0.06 per share for legal and advisory fees. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. With the completion of our first phase, restructuring costs were modest this quarter and are included in our underlying results. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. 
Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.78 increased $0.23 per share or 15% versus last year despite the currency headwinds. Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.14. Net cost performance was $0.18 favorable, primarily due to the benefit from our actions taken last year to enable a new, more disciplined organization. Cost performance also included about a $0.03 benefit from lower pension costs.
Unfavorable currency was $0.08 per share, as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. 
Equity affiliate income was $0.03 unfavorable. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to higher capitalized interest and the retirement of higher-cost Indura debt last quarter. 
Taxes were $0.03 unfavorable due to higher earnings and timing of a few items. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%. 
Noncontrolling interest was $0.02 favorable due to our buyout of the remaining shares of the Indura business last quarter. And higher shares outstanding reduced EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segments results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."
248356,321331709,923838,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.First, I'd like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step-up in our margins.

First, I'd like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step-up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 450 basis points year-on-year. Going forward, we're going to drive operational productivity to new heights at Air Products, and we are going to work tirelessly to improve safety. 
In our highly distributed business, we often describe operational productivity as 10,000 little things. That means we have many opportunities to act, and our new, simpler organization is helping us to act with speed.
For example, we used to have a bias to purchase on corporate, global, sole-source agreements. And that's a good strategy for some things, but not everything. In our new organization, an empowered regional team broke this paradigm. They decided to multisource. That meant we could introduce low-cost local suppliers, and we could select the best supplier for each location. Our other regions are replicating this, and we would expect savings in the 40% range. 
We are also improving distribution routing and fleet efficiency by working with third parties to bring new ideas. We're improving operating and maintenance efficiency by using our data to adjust maintenance intervals and improving network efficiency by consolidating facilities. These are some of the 10,000 things.
With that, please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost drove the margin expansion. Sales of $836 million were down 17% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 12% and currency reduced sales by 4%. Volumes were down 3% on weakness in Latin America and in the North America steel and oil field services markets. Some steel customers idled capacity in December, which will have some impact on argon and oxygen volumes going forward. 
HyCO volumes and refinery operating rates remained strong. Pricing was up 2%, the fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas. We had particular success in South America in several specific products. 
Helium has been a strength for us, but oversupply in helium will likely begin to weaken pricing later this year. We expect the helium market to tighten again in a few years. 
Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year. And EBITDA of $335 million was up 1% as we overcame the headwinds from currency, lower energy pass-through and lower volumes through pricing, the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs.
Record operating margin of 25.3% was up 420 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 700 basis points. The impact from lower energy pass-through was about half of the margin improvement. Lower costs drove our sequential profit and margin improvement. We expect volume weakness to continue in Q2, particularly for steel in Latin America, but expect our cost focus will overcome higher major maintenance costs and drive improved profitability versus last year.
Now please turn to Slide 13. For Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses, we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions, as EBITDA and operating margin set new records, both up almost 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $438 million were down 12% due to a negative currency impact of 10%, primarily due to the euro, pound and Polish zloty, and a negative 2% impact on lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were flat, with 1% lower volumes and 1% higher prices. Positive liquid bulk volumes were more than offset by lower packaged gases volumes, in part due to weak offshore demand and by lower refinery hydrogen demand. Price was positive across all subregions. 
Operating income of $92 million was up 13%, and operating margin of 20.9% was up 470 basis points. Operating income would have been up 22% on a constant-currency basis. EBITDA of $146 million was up 2%, and EBITDA margin of 33.3% was up 480 basis points. The primary driver of improved profitability was our continued focus on costs and a positive contribution from our pricing actions.
Please turn to Slide 14, Gases Asia. As you could see from our results, our business performance was very strong again this quarter, with record operating and EBITDA margins. Despite all the talk about China, we did well in China. Of course, we expect our China tonnage volumes to be up with the new plants onstream, but merchant volumes were up also again. 
We remain cautious about the economic outlook in Asia, but are pleased with the resilience our business has demonstrated. Sales of $413 million was up 4%, primarily driven by volumes up 11%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall merchant volumes were up low double digits again across Asia, with China LOX/LIN volumes also up low double digits. We are pleased to fully bring onstream the largest ASU project that Air Products has ever built, providing oxygen to Yankuang in Yulin, China. We now have 6 large oxygen for coal gasification projects onstream in China, including over 20,000 tons a day of oxygen added this last year. 
Our customers are operating their facilities. Our plants are running well, and we are getting paid. As I've mentioned in the past, we do occasionally see swings in the energy pass-through around customer start-ups. This has no impact on profit but can impact sales and margins.
Sequentially, volumes were down 3%, in part due to a positive catch-up payment in Q4 that I mentioned last quarter. Pricing was down 2% on the continued overcapacity in the China liquid market. 
Operating income of $117 million was up 29%, and operating margin of 28.2% was up 550 basis points. EBITDA of $180 million was up 16%, and EBITDA margin of 43.6% was up 480 basis points.
Profit improvement was driven by the base business volume growth, new projects successfully coming onstream and the benefit of our cost reduction programs and about $5 million of nonrecurring items. The team is very focused on continuing to drive improvement, but we would expect some volume weakness from the lunar new year next quarter.
I'll close with a comment on global gases segment. You'll recall that this is the segment that includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region-specific. Sales were up as we began to recognize revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales.
Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."
248356,321331709,923838,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Corning.

Please turn to Slide 15. Let me start with a few general comments before I go into the numbers. In September of last year, Air Products announced its intention to separate Materials Technologies business through a spin-off to our shareholders. This strategic decision will allow Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long term. 
The new company will be called Versum Materials and will be highly profitable with strong cash flow generation and solid growth prospects. Our team is very excited about this tremendous opportunity. And as you can see from our strong results, we remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. We're also making good progress on key steps required to enable the spin-off, which we expect to be completed before September of 2016. For example, in December, we submitted initial draft of our Form 10.
On February 24, George Bitto, Versum's future CFO, Simon and I plan to host a conference call to help you understand our business including our key markets products as well as our plans for future success. Given the progress we have made in the spin-off process and the level of financial information we have provided, you will see we are sharing more details about our business.
I will first make a few comments on our overall Materials Technologies segment, and then make more specific comments on Electronic Materials and Performance Materials results for the quarter. Segment sales of $490 million were down 6% versus last year, including a negative 2% currency impact. As a reminder, for Materials Technology, currency volatility has a greater impact on our business than on the industrial gas business of Air Products. Given the global nature of our supply network, we have both translational and transactional impact from currency, but more so for Performance Materials, where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe and Latin America.
Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower demand in Performance Materials. Pricing was up 2%.
EBITDA of $147 million was up 14%, and EBITDA margins were up 530 basis points. Operating income of $127 million was up 22%, and operating margins of 26% was up 600 basis points. Another record margin quarter driven by cost reduction actions and the management of price versus raw materials. Most importantly, we bounced back very well from a softer fourth quarter.
As I told you last quarter, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015, and we're still committed to this. We're off to a great start in the first quarter but are somewhat cautious of the second quarter, given the decline in the delivery systems activity that I mentioned before and the weak macroeconomic environment impacting demand, continued currency headwinds and the impact of lower raw material costs on our inventories. But as you know, the second half of the year is typically the stronger part of the year for our business.
On Slide 16, you can see the results of Electronic Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 4% on lower volumes, improved pricing and mix and negative currency effect. As expected, delivery system activity was down significantly. Despite key products in our PM portfolio being capacity-constrained, our overall materials volumes were flat, as we continue to see strong demand in Advanced Materials business. It's a great example of innovation that continues to be at the core of our organic growth and of the future products and solutions for our customers. 
For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $96 million was up 27%, and EBITDA margins of 39.2% was up almost 1,000 basis points. Operating income of $83 million was up 43%, and margins of 33.9% was up over 1,000 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our cost reduction actions were the key drivers. The quarter also benefited from the timing impact of portfolio actions we have taken. These are worth about 200 basis points. The rest of the 800 basis point improvement is from underlying business performance.
On Slide 17, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 9% on lower volumes, lower prices and negative currency effect. Volumes were down in epoxy and additives business, driven by weak global demand in general, and in particular, weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. This includes a specific customer shutdown in Brazil. Prices were down but were more than offset by lower raw material costs. 
Performance Materials EBITDA of $51 million was down 7%, but margins of 20.9% was up 50 basis points. Operating income of $44 million was down 7%, but margins of 18% was up 30 basis points. The lower volumes and the negative impact of currency more than offset the benefits of pricing relative to raw materials and the cost reduction actions.
On Slide 18, you can see the trailing 12-month results from Materials Technologies segment: sales of just over $2 billion, EBITDA of $590 million with margins of 28.7% and operating income of almost $500 million with margins of 24.3%. This is as reported within Air Products and does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, Versum Materials will be a very high-quality company with very attractive margins.
Slide 19 shows the operating margin improvement in Materials Technologies over the last 3 years. Although recent market dynamics have been favorable for a few products, the overall performance was not driven by a cyclical peak, as the business environment varied significantly over this period of time. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts over the last 3 years: innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven by -- in part by macroeconomic drivers, we do not see this as a cyclical business. The semiconductor industry has changed, and the underlying improvements we have made in Process Materials is sustainable.
As I indicated in the past, we are capacity-constrained in several product lines, and we are launching several new products in Advanced Materials, all of which require us to expand capacity. We continue to make good progress on the capital projects I talked about in our last 2 earnings calls. As you saw from the initial draft Form 10, the spending on these expansion project increased total CapEx to about $100 million in fiscal year '15. We expect fiscal year '16 CapEx to be about $200 million before it drops back down to more typical levels of below $100 million for fiscal year '17.
Keep in mind that we only make these types of large capital investments every few years. In fact, the last one was 8 years ago. As I said, Versum will generate very strong cash flows.
We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. And equally important, we are committed to meeting or exceeding our time line for the spin-off of Materials Technologies business as a stand-alone company. I know that I can speak for the entire team that we are committing to adding value to our customers, to the success of the business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders. Again, I look forward to sharing more information with you on our call on February 24.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the corporate segment."

Our corporate segment consists of our energy and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were flat versus last year as higher LNG sales were offset by lower helium containers sales. LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY '16 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs.

Now please turn to Slide #20 for the discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on the things we can control towards our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.26 or 16% over the second quarter of last year and would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background and increased currency headwinds, we are confident in delivering on and on maintaining our full year fiscal year 2016 guidance of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At midpoint, this will be a 12% increase over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. The full year and quarterly guidance include the Materials Technologies business as part of Air Products for the full 2016.
Primarily as a result of our decision to suspend construction of Tees Valley 2 project, we now expect our CapEx to be about $1.3 billion for the year, down about 25% from fiscal year 2015.
As you can see from our results, we improved free cash flow by $200 million this quarter. You have heard me talk about priorities for the use of cash we generate, and I would like to reiterate them in the order of priority. Our #1 priority is to maintain an A rating -- an A credit rating. Number two, we will use our cash to invest in good projects and good and accretive acquisitions. Number three, we will continue to increase our dividends. And number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. The cash we generate belongs to the shareholders, and we only spend our cash if we have enough high-return projects and acquisitions. Otherwise, as I have said, we would return it to our shareholders.
Air Products' growth into the future will not be driven by any single large event. I'm confident we will deliver on our commitment to spin Materials Technologies and we will resolve our Energy-from-Waste business in Northern England. 
Our future growth and profit growth will be driven by executing on the basics of our industrial gas business. That is, we will focus on all aspects of growth in our Industrial Gases. We will deliver the second $300 million of cost savings over the next few years, enabled by the more focused and accountable organization we already have in place. We will deliver on projects in our backlog, and we will compete for and win new projects at high return. 
We certainly understand there is significant uncertainty in the world today, but we are focused on the things we control to drive improvement. We believe in self-help, regardless of the external environment. The future is very bright for Industrial Gases business in general, and most importantly for Air Products. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change, and we are blessed with having a great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 170,000 outstanding customers to serve. I am very proud of our people, incredibly optimistic about the future of Air Products and consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team.

I think, in the last 2 calls, we already predicted that this -- the delivery systems, the equipment business was going to be slowing down versus prior year. A lot of it was because of some projects that we did last year. So our delta was probably more driven from that project differential. Now if you look at a lot of the projections, and this has been how the actual demand has been tracking from a lot of the third-party industry, the projection was for a softening in CapEx. That would start to pick up in the back end of 2016, and we're still tracking that. So it hasn't been a big surprise for us. Regarding the inventory reval, this is why I'm a little bit more cautious for the second quarter. Not that we're seeing a big change in dynamics versus what we'd projected in the past, but in the near term, the headwinds of currency, oil price deflation and the impact it's having on our prices that we should have some inventory reval.

All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.
I am a very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite sluggish economic growth worldwide and currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on our 5-point strategic plan and delivered $1.82 per share of earnings, which is up 17% over last year, and on a constant-currency basis, our EPS is up 20% versus last year.
Another quarter of outstanding performance is due entirely to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' talented, committed and motivated employees around the world. I once again want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal.
Please go to Slide #3. We always start our internal meetings with the discussion on safety, and I want to do the same today in our presentation to you. Of our quarter 2 performance in safety was better than last year and did improve relative to our disappointing first quarter performance. So I'm pleased that we are moving in the right direction. However, the only acceptable goal is 0 accidents and we have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee. 
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we can focus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before but I would like to emphasize it again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on our 5-point strategic plan that we announced 1.5 years ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter and I would like to make a few more comments.
The first point of this plan was to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business, and therefore, divest of our non-core businesses. In September 2015, we announced plans to spin-off our Materials Technologies business tax-free to our shareholders and set it up as a separate public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form 10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission and have since updated that, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work necessary to implement this plan. But most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong results quarter after quarter. We are on track to complete the separation of this business from our core by the end of September 2016, and we continue to evaluate whether debt and equity market conditions are favorable for a spin-off.
The second non-core business is Energy-from-Waste. Scott will take you through the details, but as a result of the decision to exit this business last month, we have taken a pretax charge of almost $1 billion this quarter primarily to write down assets associated with the Energy-from-Waste business to their realizable value.
The fourth point of our plan is the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. We have a very robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million and have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
Our backlog is down this quarter because we successfully brought on stream the new hydrogen plant in Canada serving Shell and the local pipeline system there. As I have mentioned previously, I remain very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in larger scale on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants.
In the area of restructuring, the actions we took last year to eliminate unnecessary work have already reduced our overhead by $300 million a year and you're seeing the benefits of these efforts in our results. We are making great progress on our plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational savings in the next 4 years through self-help measures, including plant operations, distribution, sourcing and overhead costs. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. 
Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I wanted to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points versus last year, increased our earnings per share by 17% and most importantly, our return on capital employed is now up 200 basis points to 13%. Our restructuring actions enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Also, please note that this is the seventh consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. 
And now, if you please turn to my very favorite slide, Slide #8. You will see our progress over the last 2 years, where we have improved our margins by 1,000 basis points. Yes, 1,000 basis points. And during this same 2 years time frame, our earnings per share is up 37%. This single chart is a great demonstration of how focused the Air Products team is and we are determined to continue to improve our profitability.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

For our second quarter, sales of $2.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy passthrough impacts of 3% each. Volumes were unchanged as Gases Asia growth continued while other segments volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later.
Pricing rounded down to 0 but was just slightly positive driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $797 million improved by 12% and operating income of $532 million improved by 20% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 560 basis points to 35.1% while our operating margin improved 500 basis points to 23.4%. 
We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy passthrough only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 460 basis points resulted primarily from the benefit of the restructuring actions we had taken and a smaller benefit from price versus raw materials. 
Our actions continue to show results and this is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. 
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 18% and 17%, respectively. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13% on our higher profitability.
As Simon mentioned previously, Energy-from-Waste has been moved to discontinued operations and is not included in these numbers. 
Now please turn to Slide 10.
You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by about $50 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA. 
I want to point out that for consistency, we've restated the prior year's growth CapEx to exclude Energy-from-Waste. As a result of the higher EBITDA and the lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $220 million this quarter and $121 million higher than last year. Just as a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11. We've included some additional information regarding our decision to exit the Energy-from-Waste business that we announced earlier this month. The decision to exit the business and stop efforts to start up and operate our Energy-from-Waste projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the first project.
Based on extended testing and analysis completed this past quarter, significant additional time and resources would have been required to make the projects operational. In addition, the decision allows us to execute our strategy of focusing resources on our core Industrial Gases business.
As a result of this decision, the Energy-from-Waste segment has been moved to discontinued operations and prior-year information has been restated for comparison purposes. 
We recorded a pretax charge of $946 million during fiscal Q2. This loss includes $914 million to write down the plant assets to their estimated salvage value of $20 million. The chart also includes $32 million for plant disposition and severance costs. The projects are located on leased land that requires removal of the facility. It is expected that this facility will be completed in fiscal 2017.
As a result of removing this asset value from the denominator, ROCE increases by approximately 100 basis points. Additional exit costs estimated at $50 million to $100 million may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and sell the remaining purchase contracts. 
We're also still evaluating an ASU built primarily to serve the Energy-from-Waste site. Its current book value is approximately $60 million and is in our Gases EMEA segment. 
There is no change to our continuing operations booked effective tax rate. There will be a modest cash tax benefit totaling about $75 million to $100 million that we expect to recognize over the next 10 plus years.
In terms of future uses of cash, we see a potential net cash cost of $60 million to $110 million for the various items mentioned above. However, as we've said, we are working to optimize the cash value of our investment.
Turning on to Slide #12. You can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.08 per share or $19 million pretax.
We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $7 million or $0.04 per share primarily for legal and other advisory fees. As I mentioned last quarter, we had completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. We are now focused on the second $300 million of operational improvements. In Q2, we incurred a $9 million or $0.03 per share charge associated with these actions. We also recorded a $3 million or $0.01 per share pension settlement charge. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix Slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.26 per share or 17% versus last year. The impact from lower volumes decreased EPS by $0.10 per share primarily due to a positive prior year contract wrap up in global Gases and lower LNG sales equipment activity.
Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.08 primarily driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.36 per share favorable primarily due to the benefit of our restructuring actions taken last year and good progress on our operational improvements. Cost performance also benefited by about $0.15 from lower incentive compensation, lower pension costs and other income expense. Unfavorable currency was $0.05 as many currencies besides the euro weakened against the dollar. As a reminder for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity affiliate income was unchanged. Interest expense of $0.01 was $0.01 higher primarily due to higher capitalized interest from lower capital spending. Taxes were $0.02 unfavorable due to higher earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%.
Now to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Let me start by thanking the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for delivering another very strong quarter. Despite continuing currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions, each of the regional teams delivered EBITDA margins that were up more than 500 basis points. 
We're focused on the things we can control, primarily driving operational productivity and we also improved our safety performance this quarter. We described our operational approach opportunity as 10,000 little things, meaning we have many opportunities to act and drive improvement. As an example, we have a large network of plants that produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon, LOX, LIN and LAR. Many of them also serve pipeline customers like steel mills. As pipeline customers demands swing and local power rates shift, the availability and cost of liquid product changes, too. We are working with third-party providers including outside distribution experts to modernize our sales and operations planning process and tools to help us to reliably serve our customers for the lowest cost everyday. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results.
Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on restructuring actions and self-help measures drove the significant margin expansion. Sales of $798 million were down 10% versus last year as the passthrough of lower energy prices reduced sales by 6% and currency reduced sales by 3%. Volumes were down 2% primarily driven by weakness in Latin America. We also saw continued to see lower fuel demand versus last year although we'll begin to lap that decline next quarter. Steel remains weak. We haven't yet seen any improvement to speak of in our customers' operations. Although HyCo volumes were down slightly and modest customer outages, underlying demand remains strong. Pricing was up versus prior year for the sixth consecutive quarter with a key focus on recovering inflation in South America. Volumes were down sequentially primarily in South America seasonality.
Operating income of $224 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $341 million was up 14% versus last year as the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy passthrough. Record operating margin of 28.1% was up 770 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 42.8% was up over 900 basis points. Lower energy passthrough though accounted for only about 100 basis point of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 670 basis points excluding lower energy passthrough. 
Finally, we are pleased to bring onstream our newest $150 million standard cubic foot a day 80 hydrogen plant located in Scotchgard, northeast of Edmonton in Alberta. This new steam methane reformer provides hydrogen and steam to Shell Canada's Scotchgard facility and will supply hydrogen to Northwest refinery. The plant is connected to our Heartland hydrogen pipeline system that is also fed by 2 hydrogen plants in Edmonton and supplies refiners upgraders, chemical processors and other industries.  As this plant came onstream right at the end of the quarter, it did not contribute to our Q2 results. 
Now please turn to Slide 14.
For the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our restructuring and pricing actions more than offsetting volume weaknesses as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $420 million were down 6% due to a negative currency impact of 3% and a negative 4% impact from lower energy passthrough. Underlying sales were up 1% as 2% higher prices more than offset 1% lower volumes.
We have not really seen much demand improvement in Europe but continue to work hard on price increases, delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing. 
Operating income of $89 million was up 26% and EBITDA of $145 million was up 14% as our restructuring and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. 
Record operating margin of 21.3% was up over 500 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 34.5% was up over 600. Lower energy passthrough accounted for about 50 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 500 basis points excluding lower energy passthrough.
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. 
Volume growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions grow significant margin improvement over last year. Sales of $406 million were up 3% primarily driven by volumes, up 10%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan. Overall merchant volumes were up high single digits, both across Asia and in China specifically. We continue to see the benefits of large on-site plant projects we brought on stream over the last year as well as an increase in energy passthrough revenue at a few of these recently started up plants. Our coal gasification customers in China continued to operate their facilities at high rates. Our plants continue to run well. And most importantly, we continue to get paid.
Pricing was down 1% reflecting a reduced rate of decline in LOX, LIN and LAR pricing despite the substantial overcapacity in China. Operating income of $104 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $170 million was up 18% as our restructuring actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 25.7% was up over 400 basis points and EBITDA margin of 41.9% was up over 500 basis points. We did see a sequential decline in profits driven by about $5 million of positive nonrecurring items last quarter, currency and the expected lower merchant volumes during the Lunar New Year. I would add that it seems that our customers Lunar New Year outages this year were fairly typical relative to previous years and we didn't see them taking extended outages.
I will close with a brief comments on Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gases business, which are not region specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $30 million of revenue from the ASU sale of equipment and that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. However, we did not recognize any profits this quarter from as we're still early in the project. Cost in the segment were down, but profits were down as the prior year quarter had a nonrecurring benefit from a contract wrap-up. 
Now please turn to Slide 16 and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

The Materials Technologies team delivered another strong quarter. As I shared with you during our February Versum conference call, we believe we have made structural and sustainable improvements to our business, which you can see from this graph on the margin improvement over last 3 years. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts, innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions.
While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by end market changes, we do not see this as a cyclical business. 
Turning to Slide 17 on this quarter's results. Segment sales of $490 million were down 7% versus last year. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower additives and epoxy demand in Performance Materials.
EBITDA of $150 million was up 1% and operating income of $129 million was up 4% as price raw material management, mix and our restructuring actions more than offset headwinds from lower volumes and currency. As a result, EBITDA margins of 30.2% was up 240 basis points and operating margin of 26.2% was up almost 300 basis points, both representing another quarterly record.
In October, I told you that we expected to deliver higher profits in 2016 than in 2015 and we are well on our way. To 2 quarters, our EBITDA is up about $20 million higher than last year. We remain confident on our outlook for 2016 and are working to continue to deliver improved profits in the second half of the year.
On Slide 18, you can see the results for Electronic Materials. Sales of $234 million were down 10% on lower volumes while higher pricing offset negative currency effect. As expected, delivery systems activity was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. Overall materials volume were roughly flat as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business partially offset by weakness in our Taiwan foundry customers.
For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $83 million was down 1% and operating income of $70 million was up 4% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.5% were up over 300 basis points and operating margins of 30.1% was up 400 basis points. Pricing and mix and a benefit of our restructuring actions were the key drivers more than offsetting currency headwinds. 
On Slide 19, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $261 million were down 5% on 2% lower volumes, 2% lower prices and 1% negative currency effect. Epoxy volumes were down on weakness in oil and gas and marine coatings. Additive volumes were also impacted by oil and gas weakness as well as mining, including a specific customer temporary site shut down in Brazil. We did see stronger polyurethane additives volumes across all market segments. Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical driven deflation but were more than offset by lower raw material cost. 
For Performance Materials, EBITDA of $67 million was up 1% and operating income of $60 million was up 2%.  EBITDA margins of 25.8% and operating margins of 22.8% were both are up 160 basis points primarily driven by mix improvement and favorable price raw material balance.
On Slide 20, you can see the updated trailing 12-month results for Materials Technologies segment. Sales of over $2 billion, EBITDA of $591 million with margins of 29.3% and operating income of $504 million with margins of 25%. This is as reported within Air Products so it does not include any allocated corporate costs. 
As you can see, our results continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins. Our team remains focused on our key priorities, safety, top line growth and margin enhancement.

The Air Products team is focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the quarter -- for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.92. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.24 or 14% over the third quarter of last year and would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth that we have delivered. 
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background but based on our strong focus on self-help measures, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2016 guidance to $7.40 to $7.55 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.88 or 13% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance and is $0.10 higher than the guidance we gave you in October. 
We now expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion for the year, down about 30% from fiscal year 2015. 
As you can see from our results, we improved our free cash flow by over $120 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: #1, maintaining our A credit rating; #2, investing in good projects and accretive acquisitions; #3, continuing to increase our dividend; and #4, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At the end of the day, the cash that we generated the lowest of the shareholders and we will only spend our cash if we have enough high return projects or good acquisitions.

So if you come down to it, if you ask me, there's really turns, if you go back to the concept of focus on the core. So we focused on Gases. We give the customers good service. We earn the right to raise the price increases. And we've got a self-confident and motivated team that goes out and gets it, and I see that trend continuing for us."

That's about technology and innovation and how we improve the overall mix of our business and that's been going very well. Our innovation engine is doing well and mix improvement has been a good driver of our margin improvement and growth. I think the second driver is just competitive dynamics, where we are in different markets. If you look at all the actions we've taken on the portfolio side and our cost actions, we're in a much more competitive position and that's allowed us to play a much more offensive game in terms of both volumes and pricing in those kinds of segments. I think the last segment for us is it's mostly around our functional surfactants and that's more formula based pricing where the raw materials do have a component. So we've had a favorable lag effect as we look through that pricing overall but all 3 of those areas have been performing very well for us."

And even in North America, steel, you're making steel that goes into a car, you're doing great. You're making tube, you're not doing well. So we in fact have 2 mills that are down. I mean, they pay their but they're down. If they were to restart, right, and the economy picked up, that would be positive. Yes, it would make more argon, but probably in that same environment, we'd see demand for stainless steel increase and stainless steel takes a lot of argon. So I personally think the argon market in the U.S. will remain relatively tight through this transition here."

So if you think [indiscernible] as an example in the clean business, now you have more steps, demand is going up, and that's was driven a lot of the volume growth on the material side.

In addi",1236,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our Materials Technologies business, now called Versum. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.
I am a very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite sluggish economic growth worldwide and currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on our 5-point strategic plan and delivered $1.82 per share of earnings, which is up 17% over last year, and on a constant-currency basis, our EPS is up 20% versus last year.
Another quarter of outstanding performance is due entirely to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' talented, committed and motivated employees around the world. I once again want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal.
Please go to Slide #3. We always start our internal meetings with the discussion on safety, and I want to do the same today in our presentation to you. Our quarter 2 performance in safety was better than last year and did improve relative to our disappointing first quarter performance. So I'm pleased that we are moving in the right direction. However, the only acceptable goal is 0 accidents and we have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee. 
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we can focus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize it again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on our 5-point strategic plan that we announced 1.5 years ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter and I would like to make a few more comments.
The first point of this plan was to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business, and therefore, divest of our non-core businesses. In September 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business tax-free to our shareholders and set it up as a separate public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form 10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission and have since updated that, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work necessary to implement this plan. But most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong results quarter-after-quarter. We are on track to complete the separation of this business from our core by the end of September 2016, and we'll continue to evaluate whether debt and equity market conditions are favorable for a spinoff.
The second non-core business is Energy-from-Waste. Scott will take you through the details, but as a result of the decision to exit this business last month, we have taken a pretax charge of almost $1 billion this quarter primarily to write down assets associated with the Energy-from-Waste business to their realizable value.
The fourth point of our plan is the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. We have a very robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million and have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
Our backlog is down this quarter because we successfully brought on stream the new hydrogen plant in Canada serving Shell and the local pipeline system there. As I have mentioned previously, I remain very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in larger scale on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants.
In the area of restructuring, the actions we took last year to eliminate unnecessary work have already reduced our overhead by $300 million a year. And you're seeing the benefits of these efforts in our results. We are making great progress on our plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational savings in the next 4 years through self-help measures, including plant operations, distribution, sourcing and overhead costs. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. 
Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I wanted to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points versus last year, increased our earnings per share by 17% and most importantly, our return on capital employed is now up 200 basis points to 13%. Our restructuring actions enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Also, please note that this is the seventh consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. 
And now, if you please turn to my very favorite slide, Slide #8. You will see our progress over the last 2 years where we have improved our margins by 1,000 basis points. Yes, 1,000 basis points. And during this same 2 years' time frame, our earnings per share is up 37%. This single chart is a great demonstration of how focused the Air Products team is. And we are determined to continue to improve our profitability.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

For our second quarter, sales of $2.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 3% each. Volumes were unchanged as Gases Asia growth continued while other segment volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later.
Pricing rounded down to 0, but was just slightly positive driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $797 million improved by 12% and operating income of $532 million improved by 20% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 560 basis points to 35.1% while our operating margin improved 500 basis points to 23.4%. 
We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 460 basis points resulted primarily from the benefit of the restructuring actions we have taken and a smaller benefit from price versus raw materials. 
Our actions continue to show results and this is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. 
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 18% and 17%, respectively. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13% on our higher profitability.
As Simon mentioned previously, Energy-from-Waste has been moved to discontinued operations and is not included in these numbers. 
Now please turn to Slide 10.
You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by about $50 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA. 
I want to point out that for consistency, we've restated the prior year's growth CapEx to exclude Energy-from-Waste. As a result of the higher EBITDA and the lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $220 million this quarter and $121 million higher than last year. Just as a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11. We've included some additional information regarding our decision to exit the Energy-from-Waste business that we announced earlier this month. The decision to exit the business and stop efforts to start up and operate our Energy-from-Waste projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the first project.
Based on extended testing and analysis completed this past quarter, significant additional time and resources would have been required to make the projects operational. In addition, the decision allows us to execute our strategy of focusing resources on our core Industrial Gases business.
As a result of this decision, the Energy-from-Waste segment has been moved to discontinued operations and prior-year information has been restated for comparison purposes. 
We recorded a pretax charge of $946 million during fiscal Q2. This loss includes $914 million to write down the plant assets to their estimated salvage value of $20 million. The chart also includes $32 million for plant disposition and severance costs. The projects are located on leased land that requires removal of the facility. It is expected that this [indiscernible] and other facility will be completed in fiscal 2017.
As a result of removing this asset value from the denominator, ROCE increases by approximately 100 basis points. Additional exit costs estimated at $50 million to $100 million may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and sell the remaining purchase contracts. 
We are also still evaluating an ASU built primarily to serve the Energy-from-Waste site. Its current book value is approximately $60 million and is in our Gases EMEA segment. 
There is no change to our continuing operations booked effective tax rate. There will be a modest cash tax benefit totaling about $75 million to $100 million that we expect to recognize over the next 10-plus years.
In terms of future uses of cash, we see a potential net cash cost of $60 million to $110 million for the various items mentioned above. However, as we've said, we are working to optimize the cash value of our investment.
Turning now to Slide #12. You can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.08 per share or $19 million pretax.
We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $7 million or $0.04 per share primarily for legal and other advisory fees. As I'd mentioned last quarter, we had completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. We are now focused on the second $300 million of operational improvements. In Q2, we incurred a $9 million or $0.03 per share charge associated with these actions. We also recorded a $3 million or $0.01 per share pension settlement charge. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.26 per share or 17% versus last year. The impact from lower volumes decreased EPS by $0.10 per share primarily due to a positive prior year contract wrap up in global Gases and the lower LNG sale of equipment activity.
Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.08, primarily driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.36 per share favorable, primarily due to the benefit of our restructuring actions taken last year and good progress on our operational improvements. Cost performance also benefited by about $0.15 from lower incentive compensation, lower pension costs and other income and expense. Unfavorable currency was $0.05 as many currencies besides the euro weakened against the dollar. As a reminder for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity affiliate income was unchanged. Interest expense of $0.01 was $0.01 higher primarily due to lower capitalized interest from lower capital spending. Taxes were $0.02 unfavorable due to higher earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%.
Now to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Let me start by thanking the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for delivering another very strong quarter. Despite continuing currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions, each of the regional teams delivered EBITDA margins that were up more than 500 basis points. 
We are focused on the things we can control, primarily driving operational productivity. And we also improved our safety performance this quarter. We have described our operational approach and the opportunity as 10,000 little things, meaning we have many opportunities to act and drive improvement. As an example, we have a large network of plants that produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon, LOX, LIN and LAR. Many of them also serve pipeline customers like steel mills. As pipeline customers' demands swing and local power rates shift, the availability and cost of liquid product changes, too. We are working with third-party providers, including outside distribution experts, to modernize our sales and operations planning process and tools to help us to reliably serve our customers for the lowest cost every day. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results.
Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on restructuring actions and self-help measures drove the significant margin expansion. Sales of $798 million were down 10% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 6% and currency reduced sales by 3%. Volumes were down 2%, primarily driven by weakness in Latin America. We also saw -- continued to see lower oil field demand versus last year, although we'll begin to lap that decline next quarter. Steel remains weak. We haven't yet seen any improvement to speak of in our customers' operations. Although HyCO volumes were down slightly and modest customer outages, underlying demand remains strong. Pricing was up versus prior year for the sixth consecutive quarter with a key focus on recovering inflation in South America. Volumes were down sequentially primarily in South America seasonality.
Operating income of $224 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $341 million was up 14% versus last year as the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. Record operating margin of 28.1% was up 770 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 42.8% was up over 900 basis points. Lower energy pass-through though accounted for only about 100 basis point of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 670 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through. 
Finally, we are pleased to bring on stream our newest 150 million standard cubic foot a day hydrogen plant located in Scotford, northeast of Edmonton in Alberta. This new steam methane reformer provides hydrogen and steam to Shell Canada's Scotford facility and will supply hydrogen to North West Refinery. The plant is connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system that is also fed by 2 hydrogen plants in Edmonton and supplies refiners, upgraders, chemical processors and other industries.  As this plant came onstream right at the end of the quarter, it did not contribute to our Q2 results. 
Now please turn to Slide 14.
For the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our restructuring and pricing actions more than offsetting volume weaknesses as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $420 million were down 6% due to a negative currency impact of 3% and a negative 4% impact from lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were up 1% as 2% higher prices more than offset 1% lower volumes.
We have not really seen much demand improvement in Europe, but continue to work hard on price increases, delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing. 
Operating income of $89 million was up 26% and EBITDA of $145 million was up 14% as our restructuring and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. 
Record operating margin of 21.3% was up over 500 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 34.5% was up over 600. Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 50 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 500 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.  
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions grow significant margin improvement over last year. Sales of $406 million were up 3%, primarily driven by volumes, up 10%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan. Overall merchant volumes were up high single digits, both across Asia and in China, specifically. We continue to see the benefits of large on-site plant projects we brought onstream over the last year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue at a few of these recently started up plants. Our coal gasification customers in China continued to operate their facilities at high rates. Our plants continue to run well. And most importantly, we continue to get paid.
Pricing was down 1%, reflecting a reduced rate of decline in LOX, LIN and LAR pricing despite the substantial overcapacity in China. Operating income of $104 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $170 million was up 18% as our restructuring actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 25.7% was up over 400 basis points and EBITDA margin of 41.9% was up over 500 basis points. We did see a sequential decline in profits driven by about $5 million of positive nonrecurring items last quarter, currency and the expected lower merchant volumes during the Lunar New Year. I would add that it seems that our customers' Lunar New Year outages this year were fairly typical relative to previous years and we didn't see them taking extended outages.
I'll close with a brief comment on Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gases business, which are not region specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $30 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment and that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. However, we did not recognize any profits this quarter from Jazan as we're still early in the project. Costs in the segment were down, but profits were down as the prior-year quarter had a nonrecurring benefit from a contract wrap-up. 
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

The Materials Technologies team delivered another strong quarter. As I shared with you during our February Versum conference call, we believe we've made structural and sustainable improvements to our business, which you can see from this graph of the margin improvement over the last 3 years. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts, innovation, focusing on our key products' end markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions.
While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by end market changes, we do not see this as a cyclical business. 
Turning to Slide 17 on this quarter's results. Segment sales of $490 million were down 7% versus last year. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower additives and epoxy demand in Performance Materials.
EBITDA of $150 million was up 1% and operating income of $129 million was up 4% as price raw material management, mix and our restructuring actions more than offset headwinds from lower volumes and currency. As a result, EBITDA margins of 30.2% was up 240 basis points and operating margin of 26.2% was up almost 300 basis points, both representing another quarterly record.
In October, I told you that we expected to deliver higher profits in 2016 than in 2015 and we are well on our way. To 2 quarters, our EBITDA is up about $20 million higher than last year. We remain confident on our outlook for 2016 and are working to continue to deliver improved profits in the second half of the year.
On Slide 18, you can see the results for Electronic Materials. Sales of $234 million were down 10% on lower volumes while higher pricing offset negative currency effect. As expected, delivery systems activity was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. Overall materials volume were roughly flat as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business partially offset by weakness in our Taiwan foundry customers.
For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $83 million was down 1% and operating income of $70 million was up 4% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.5% were up over 300 basis points and operating margins of 30.1% was up 400 basis points. Pricing and mix and a benefit of our restructuring actions were the key drivers, more than offsetting currency headwinds. 
On Slide 19, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $261 million were down 5% on 2% lower volumes, 2% lower prices and 1% negative currency effect. Epoxy volumes were down on weakness in oil and gas and marine coatings. Additive volumes were also impacted by oil and gas weakness as well as mining, including a specific customer temporary site shutdown in Brazil. We did see stronger polyurethane additives volumes across all market segments. Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material cost. 
For Performance Materials, EBITDA of $67 million was up 1% and operating income of $60 million was up 2%.  EBITDA margins of 25.8% and operating margins of 22.8% were both are up 160 basis points, primarily driven by mix improvement and favorable price raw material balance.
On Slide 20, you can see the updated trailing 12-month results for Materials Technologies segment. Sales of over $2 billion, EBITDA of $591 million with margins of 29.3% and operating income of $504 million with margins of 25%. This is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any allocated corporate costs. 
As you can see, our results continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins. Our team remains focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement.

The Air Products team is focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the quarter -- for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.92. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.24 or 14% over the third quarter of last year and would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth that we have delivered. 
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background, but based on our strong focus on self-help measures, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2016 guidance to $7.40 to $7.55 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.88 or 13% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance and is $0.10 higher than the guidance we gave you in October. 
We now expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion for the year, down about 30% from fiscal year 2015. 
As you can see from our results, we improved our free cash flow by over $120 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating; number two, investing in good projects and accretive acquisitions; number three, continuing to increase our dividend; and number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At the end of the day, the cash that we generate belongs to the shareholders and we will only spend our cash if we have enough high return projects or good acquisitions.

Then the last segment for us is it's mostly around our functional surfactants and that's more formula-based pricing where the raw materials do have a component. So we've had a favorable lag effect as we look through that pricing overall. But all 3 of those areas have been performing very well for us."

It is so specific what's happening in one segment versus another. And even in North America steel, you're making steel that goes into a car, you're doing great. You're making tube, you're not doing well. So we, in fact, have 2 mills that are down. I mean, they pay their BOC, but they're down. If they were to restart, right, and the economy picked up, that would be positive. Yes, it would make more argon, but probably in that same environment, we'd see demand for stainless steel increase and stainless steel takes a lot of argon. So I personally think the argon market in the U.S. is going to remain relatively tight through this transition here."

On the Process Materials, our volumes are holding up. We've been capacity-constrained.

What is changing now is also that a lot of the structures are going vertical. And so you can think about if they had 25 layers before, now you have 50. They had 50, they have 100. So the amount of material used and the steps are getting much more complex and you just use a lot more. So if you think NF3, as an example, in the clean business, now you have more steps. You have more cleaning steps. Demand is going up. And that's what's driven a lot of the volume growth on the material side. So from a materials perspective, the next generation nodes, materials are going to be a much bigger driver and enabler for the newer technologies. And that's a good thing for our space."

In addi",1236,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our Materials Technologies business, now called Versum. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions.
I am a very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite sluggish economic growth worldwide and currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on our 5-point strategic plan and delivered $1.82 per share of earnings, which is up 17% over last year, and on a constant-currency basis, our EPS is up 20% versus last year.
Another quarter of outstanding performance is due entirely to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' talented, committed and motivated employees around the world. I once again want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal.
Please go to Slide #3. We always start our internal meetings with the discussion on safety, and I want to do the same today in our presentation to you. Our quarter 2 performance in safety was better than last year and did improve relative to our disappointing first quarter performance. So I'm pleased that we are moving in the right direction. However, the only acceptable goal is 0 accidents and we have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee. 
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the restatement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we can focus and improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize it again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash, and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on our 5-point strategic plan that we announced 1.5 years ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter and I would like to make a few more comments.
The first point of this plan was to focus on Industrial Gases, our core business, and therefore, divest of our non-core businesses. In September 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business tax-free to our shareholders and set it up as a separate public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form 10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission and have since updated that, and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work necessary to implement this plan. But most importantly, Guillermo and the Materials Technologies team are delivering very strong results quarter-after-quarter. We are on track to complete the separation of this business from our core by the end of September 2016, and we'll continue to evaluate whether debt and equity market conditions are favorable for a spinoff.
The second non-core business is Energy-from-Waste. Scott will take you through the details, but as a result of the decision to exit this business last month, we have taken a pretax charge of almost $1 billion this quarter primarily to write down assets associated with the Energy-from-Waste business to their realizable value.
The fourth point of our plan is the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. We have a very robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million and have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
Our backlog is down this quarter because we successfully brought on stream the new hydrogen plant in Canada serving Shell and the local pipeline system there. As I have mentioned previously, I remain very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in larger scale on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants.
In the area of restructuring, the actions we took last year to eliminate unnecessary work have already reduced our overhead by $300 million a year. And you're seeing the benefits of these efforts in our results. We are making great progress on our plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational savings in the next 4 years through self-help measures, including plant operations, distribution, sourcing and overhead costs. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. 
Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I wanted to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points versus last year, increased our earnings per share by 17% and most importantly, our return on capital employed is now up 200 basis points to 13%. Our restructuring actions enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Also, please note that this is the seventh consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. 
And now, if you please turn to my very favorite slide, Slide #8. You will see our progress over the last 2 years where we have improved our margins by 1,000 basis points. Yes, 1,000 basis points. And during this same 2 years' time frame, our earnings per share is up 37%. This single chart is a great demonstration of how focused the Air Products team is. And we are determined to continue to improve our profitability.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail.

For our second quarter, sales of $2.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 3% each. Volumes were unchanged as Gases Asia growth continued while other segment volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later.
Pricing rounded down to 0, but was just slightly positive driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $797 million improved by 12% and operating income of $532 million improved by 20% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 560 basis points to 35.1% while our operating margin improved 500 basis points to 23.4%. 
We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 460 basis points resulted primarily from the benefit of the restructuring actions we have taken and a smaller benefit from price versus raw materials. 
Our actions continue to show results and this is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. 
Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 18% and 17%, respectively. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13% on our higher profitability.
As Simon mentioned previously, Energy-from-Waste has been moved to discontinued operations and is not included in these numbers. 
Now please turn to Slide 10.
You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by about $50 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA. 
I want to point out that for consistency, we've restated the prior year's growth CapEx to exclude Energy-from-Waste. As a result of the higher EBITDA and the lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $220 million this quarter and $121 million higher than last year. Just as a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning to Slide #11. We've included some additional information regarding our decision to exit the Energy-from-Waste business that we announced earlier this month. The decision to exit the business and stop efforts to start up and operate our Energy-from-Waste projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the first project.
Based on extended testing and analysis completed this past quarter, significant additional time and resources would have been required to make the projects operational. In addition, the decision allows us to execute our strategy of focusing resources on our core Industrial Gases business.
As a result of this decision, the Energy-from-Waste segment has been moved to discontinued operations and prior-year information has been restated for comparison purposes. 
We recorded a pretax charge of $946 million during fiscal Q2. This loss includes $914 million to write down the plant assets to their estimated salvage value of $20 million. The charge also includes $32 million for plant disposition and severance costs. The projects are located on leased land that requires removal of the facility. It is expected that dismantlement of the facility will be completed in fiscal 2017.
As a result of removing this asset value from the denominator, ROCE increases by approximately 100 basis points. Additional exit costs estimated at $50 million to $100 million may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and settle remaining purchase contracts. 
We are also still evaluating an ASU built primarily to serve the Energy-from-Waste site. Its current book value is approximately $60 million and is in our Gases EMEA segment. 
There is no change to our continuing operations booked effective tax rate. There will be a modest cash tax benefit totaling about $75 million to $100 million that we expect to recognize over the next 10-plus years.
In terms of future uses of cash, we see a potential net cash cost of $60 million to $110 million for the various items mentioned above. However, as we've said, we are working to optimize the cash value of our investment.
Turning now to Slide #12. You can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.08 per share or $19 million pretax.
We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $7 million or $0.04 per share primarily for legal and other advisory fees. As I'd mentioned last quarter, we had completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. We are now focused on the second $300 million of operational improvements. In Q2, we incurred a $9 million or $0.03 per share charge associated with these actions. We also recorded a $3 million or $0.01 per share pension settlement charge. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.26 per share or 17% versus last year. The impact from lower volumes decreased EPS by $0.10 per share primarily due to a positive prior year contract wrap up in global Gases and the lower LNG sale of equipment activity.
Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.08, primarily driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.36 per share favorable, primarily due to the benefit of our restructuring actions taken last year and good progress on our operational improvements. Cost performance also benefited by about $0.15 from lower incentive compensation, lower pension costs and other income and expense. Unfavorable currency was $0.05 as many currencies besides the euro weakened against the dollar. As a reminder for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity affiliate income was unchanged. Interest expense of $0.01 was $0.01 higher primarily due to lower capitalized interest from lower capital spending. Taxes were $0.02 unfavorable due to higher earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%.
Now to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Let me start by thanking the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for delivering another very strong quarter. Despite continuing currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions, each of the regional teams delivered EBITDA margins that were up more than 500 basis points. 
We are focused on the things we can control, primarily driving operational productivity. And we also improved our safety performance this quarter. We have described our operational productivity opportunity as 10,000 little things, meaning we have many opportunities to act and drive improvement. As an example, we have a large network of plants that produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon, LOX, LIN and LAR. Many of them also serve pipeline customers like steel mills. As pipeline customer demand swings and local power rates shift, the availability and cost of liquid product changes, too. We are working with third-party providers, including outside distribution experts, to modernize our sales and operations planning process and tools to help us to reliably serve our customers for the lowest cost every day. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results.
Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on restructuring actions and self-help measures drove the significant margin expansion. Sales of $798 million were down 10% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 6% and currency reduced sales by 3%. Volumes were down 2%, primarily driven by weakness in Latin America. We also saw -- continued to see lower oil field demand versus last year, although we'll begin to lap that decline next quarter. Steel remains weak. We haven't yet seen any improvement to speak of in our customers' operations. Although HyCO volumes were down slightly on modest customer outages, underlying demand remains strong. Pricing was up versus prior year for the sixth consecutive quarter with a key focus on recovering inflation in South America. Volumes were down sequentially primarily in South America seasonality.
Operating income of $224 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $341 million was up 14% versus last year as the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. Record operating margin of 28.1% was up 770 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 42.8% was up over 900 basis points. Lower energy pass-through though accounted for only about 100 basis point of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 670 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through. 
Finally, we are pleased to bring onstream our newest 150 million standard cubic foot a day hydrogen plant located in Scotford, northeast of Edmonton in Alberta. This new steam methane reformer provides hydrogen and steam to Shell Canada's Scotford facility and will supply hydrogen to North West's Refinery. The plant is connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system that is also fed by 2 hydrogen plants in Edmonton and supplies refiners, upgraders, chemical processors and other industries.  As this plant came onstream right at the end of the quarter, it did not contribute to our Q2 results. 
Now please turn to Slide 14.
For the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our restructuring and pricing actions more than offsetting volume weaknesses as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $420 million were down 6% due to a negative currency impact of 3% and a negative 4% impact from lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were up 1% as 2% higher prices more than offset 1% lower volumes.
We have not really seen much demand improvement in Europe, but continue to work hard on price increases, delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing. 
Operating income of $89 million was up 26% and EBITDA of $145 million was up 14% as our restructuring and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. 
Record operating margin of 21.3% was up over 500 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 34.5% was up over 600. Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 50 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 500 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.  
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions drove significant margin improvement over last year. Sales of $406 million were up 3%, primarily driven by volumes, up 10%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan. Overall merchant volumes were up high single digits, both across Asia and in China, specifically. We continue to see the benefits of large on-site plant projects we brought onstream over the last year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue at a few of these recently started up plants. Our coal gasification customers in China continued to operate their facilities at high rates. Our plants continue to run well. And most importantly, we continue to get paid.
Pricing was down 1%, reflecting a reduced rate of decline in LOX, LIN and LAR pricing despite the substantial overcapacity in China. Operating income of $104 million was up 23% and EBITDA of $170 million was up 18% as our restructuring actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 25.7% was up over 400 basis points and EBITDA margin of 41.9% was up over 500 basis points. We did see a sequential decline in profits driven by about $5 million of positive nonrecurring items last quarter, currency and the expected lower merchant volumes during the Lunar New Year. I would add that it seems that our customers' Lunar New Year outages this year were fairly typical relative to previous years and we didn't see them taking extended outages.
I'll close with a brief comment on Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gases business, which are not region specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $30 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment and that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. However, we did not recognize any profits this quarter from Jazan as we're still early in the project. Costs in the segment were down, but profits were down as the prior-year quarter had a nonrecurring benefit from a contract wrap-up. 
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

The Materials Technologies team delivered another strong quarter. As I shared with you during our February Versum conference call, we believe we've made structural and sustainable improvements to our business, which you can see from this graph of the margin improvement over the last 3 years. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts, innovation, focusing on our key products' end markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions.
While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by end market changes, we do not see this as a cyclical business. 
Turning to Slide 17 on this quarter's results. Segment sales of $490 million were down 7% versus last year. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems and electronics and lower additives and epoxy demand in Performance Materials.
EBITDA of $150 million was up 1% and operating income of $129 million was up 4% as price raw material management, mix and our restructuring actions more than offset headwinds from lower volumes and currency. As a result, EBITDA margins of 30.2% was up 240 basis points and operating margin of 26.2% was up almost 300 basis points, both representing another quarterly record.
In October, I told you that we expected to deliver higher profits in 2016 than in 2015 and we are well on our way. Through 2 quarters, our EBITDA is up about $20 million higher than last year. We remain confident on our outlook for 2016 and are working to continue to deliver improved profits in the second half of the year.
On Slide 18, you can see the results for Electronic Materials. Sales of $234 million were down 10% on lower volumes while higher pricing offset negative currency effect. As expected, delivery systems activity was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. Overall materials volume were roughly flat as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business partially offset by weakness in our Taiwan foundry customers.
For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $83 million was down 1% and operating income of $70 million was up 4% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.5% were up over 300 basis points and operating margins of 30.1% was up 400 basis points. Pricing and mix and a benefit of our restructuring actions were the key drivers, more than offsetting currency headwinds. 
On Slide 19, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $261 million were down 5% on 2% lower volumes, 2% lower prices and 1% negative currency effect. Epoxy volumes were down on weakness in oil and gas and marine coatings. Additive volumes were also impacted by oil and gas weakness as well as mining, including a specific customer temporary site shutdown in Brazil. We did see stronger polyurethane additives volumes across all market segments. Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material cost. 
For Performance Materials, EBITDA of $67 million was up 1% and operating income of $60 million was up 2%.  EBITDA margins of 25.8% and operating margins of 22.8% were both up 160 basis points, primarily driven by mix improvement and favorable price raw material balance.
On Slide 20, you can see the updated trailing 12-month results for Materials Technologies segment. Sales of over $2 billion, EBITDA of $591 million with margins of 29.3% and operating income of $504 million with margins of 25%. This is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any allocated corporate costs. 
As you can see, our results continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins. Our team remains focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement.

The Air Products team is focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the quarter -- for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.92. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.24 or 14% over the third quarter of last year and would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth that we have delivered. 
Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background, but based on our strong focus on self-help measures, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2016 guidance to $7.40 to $7.55 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.88 or 13% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance and is $0.10 higher than the guidance we gave you in October. 
We now expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion for the year, down about 30% from fiscal year 2015. 
As you can see from our results, we improved our free cash flow by over $120 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating; number two, investing in good projects and accretive acquisitions; number three, continuing to increase our dividend; and number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At the end of the day, the cash that we generate belongs to the shareholders and we will only spend our cash if we have enough high return projects or good acquisitions.

I think the second driver is just competitive dynamics, where we are in different markets.

Then the last segment for us is it's mostly around our functional surfactants and that's more formula-based pricing where the raw materials do have a component. So we've had a favorable lag effect as we look through that pricing overall. But all 3 of those areas have been performing very well for us."

On the Process Materials, our volumes are holding up. We've been capacity-constrained. So some of the fluctuation in the markets haven't been as big of an impact to us, although we did see a slowdown in the early part of the quarter and a pickup in the back end of the quarter because of the Taiwan earthquake and just softness in the foundry market.

In general, that requires new materials, new processes, and that is what's driving our formula for growth traditionally. So that's something that has not changed. What is changing now is also that a lot of the structures are going vertical. And so you can think about if they had 25 layers before, now you have 50. They had 50, they have 100. So the amount of material used and the steps are getting much more complex and you just use a lot more. So if you think NF3, as an example, in the cleaning business, now you have more steps. You have more cleaning steps. Demand is going up. And that's what's driven a lot of the volume growth on the material side. So from a materials perspective, the next generation nodes, materials are going to be a much bigger driver and enabler for the newer technologies. And that's a good thing for our space."

In addition to",1226,"Thank you Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for industrial gadgets; Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technologies business, will be the future CEO of Versum Materials and Mr. George Bitto, Vice President, Finance for Materials Technologies, who will be the future CFO of Versum Materials. All of us will be participating in the call and answering your questions.
I am very pleased report that our team at Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. We delivered earnings per share of $1.92, which is up 16% over last year and it is the eighth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth.
We also improved our EBITDA margin by more than 300 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 200 basis points to 13.5%. I do want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be the best in the industry.
As we move closer to the sale of our Performance Materials Division to Evonik and the tax-free spinoff of our Electronics Materials Division, now called Versum to our shareholders, we see great opportunities ahead to win key projects and invest in our core industrial gadgets business so that we grow Air Products in the years to come.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our quarter 3 safety performance was better than last year and last quarter. But I do want to mention that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home after a hard day of work with no injuries or incidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the statement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident that we can focus and continue to improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our Five-Point Plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on executing our Five-Point Plan. The first point of the plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business, and therefore, we are in the process of divesting our noncore businesses. As Scott, Guillermo and George will provide you details, but we are making great progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik and we expect that the deal will close before the end of this calendar year. And we are well on our way to the tax-free spin-off of Electronics Materials to our shareholders as Versum Materials. These transactions will be excellent for the employees of all 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business, PMD employees will be core to a world-class materials company at Evonik, and EMD employees will be an independent best-in-class electronics material company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe that these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means we have visibility and control to ensure beyond the minimum expected return of 10% on all of our new projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
I am very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in large on-site and hydrogen plants.
In addition, the separation of PMD and EMD from Air Products will leave $20 million -- will leave about $20 million of stranded cost at Air Products. We are committed to eliminating additional work to offset these costs within a year of closing the transactions I mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I want to emphasize that the operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefits of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #8. You can see quarter-by-quarter our progress during the last 2 years. You will note that we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900, yes, 900 basis points. This single chart is a great example of the focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now please turn to Slide #9. This single slide, again, truly captures the essence of what the people of Air Products have achieved. 2 years ago, we announced that our collective goal was to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these financial metrics. The conventional wisdom at the time was that it cannot be done, that Air Products did not have the portfolio of businesses or so-called density to achieve this goal. But the people of Air Products rolled up their sleeves, went to work and said, yes, we can. So today, Air Products has the best EBITDA margin in the industry at 34.2%, the highest EBIT margin in the industry at 23% and the highest return on capital employed margin at 13.5%. Every single one of our 19,000 people have contributed to moving us forward to be the best in the industry. And let me tell you, our people are determined to maintain our leading position in the years to come.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, George and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?"

In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close this transaction by the end of calendar 2016. And we are working hard to meet that goal, subject to the various required approvals. We are working closely with Evonik on antitrust and other critical steps and are moving as quickly as possible. Second is the spinoff of EMD as Versum Materials. We said we are targeting to separate the EMD business from Air Products by September and to spinoff Versum as an independent publicly-traded company in October. We are working hard to meet this goal, including completing a variety of legal entity separations and tax activities. George will talk about an important step in this process, the filing of the Form 10, [ph] which we did last week. And while no one can predict what will happen in the markets, we are comfortable that at least today, the markets would be conducive to proceeding with the spin. So although we have a lot more work to do, at this point, subject to the timing of a pending regulatory approval, we're optimistic we will be ready to execute the spinoff in October.
Now please turn to Slide 10. For our third quarter, sales of $2.4 billion decreased 1% versus last year on lower energy passthrough and unfavorable currency impacts of 3% and 2%, respectively. Volumes were 4% higher primarily due to our project. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia and North America, offset by economic weakness in South America and Europe.
Pricing was unchanged as positive pricing in Gases Americas and Europe was offset by lower pricing in Asia and Performance Materials due to lower raw material costs.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $833 million improved by 10% and operating income improved to -- of $560 million improved by 16% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin of 34.2% and operating margin of 23% both improved by 340 basis points as we continue to execute on our Five-Point Plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies delivered margin improvement. Lower energy passthrough only contributed about 50 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Excluding the impact of energy passthrough, operating margin improved about 290 basis points primarily from the benefit of self-help actions we have taken and a modest benefit from price and lower raw material costs.
Versus prior year, net income increased by 17% and earnings per share grew 16%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13.5% on our higher profitability.
Now please turn to Slide 11. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow, so we are pleased to see that our free cash flow was $191 million this quarter, up $95 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. As a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning now to Slide 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.29 per share. We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $10 million or $0.04 per share primary for legal and other advisory fees. As our result of our decision to separate MT, we declared a dividend to repatriate $444 million from a subsidiary in South Korea, resulting in an income tax cost of $46 million or $0.21 per share. We have recognized this booked cost in Q3 because that's when the decision was made.  However, the cash flow impact will be seen in Q4 when we actually pay the tax. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of restructuring and now we are focused on our second $300 million of operational improvements. We incurred a $15 million or $0.04 per share charge associated with these operational improvement actions, and this included a $1 million pension settlement charge. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.92 increased $0.26 per share or 16% versus last year. The impact from volumes increased EPS by $0.01 per share. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.04, partially driven by lower raw material costs.
Net cost performance was $0.25 favorable, in part due to the benefit of our operational improvements and from last year's restructuring actions. Cost performance also benefited about $0.15 primarily from lower incentive compensation and lower pension costs. Currency was $0.05 unfavorable as many currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as of the vast majority of our products and made and sold in the same currency. 
Equity affiliated income was unchanged. Interest expense was $0.02 higher primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Taxes were modestly lower and contributing $0.01 to earnings.
For the year, we still expected our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, though likely closer to 25%.
Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 favorable primarily due to our increased ownership position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced our diluted EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

I'm pleased to present another quarter of very strong results and would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for staying focused on the things we control.  Our commitment to driving operational productivity while staying focused on safety allowed us to overcome currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions to deliver another great quarter. In addition, we are very excited that we continue to compete for and win key projects that will support Industrial Gases growth into the future.
Just last week, we announced a new plan to provide ultrahigh purity gases to customers in the Pukou Economic Development Zone in Nanjing, China. The Pukou Economic Development Zone is a state-level park that will be home to semiconductor and other high-tech manufacturing. In fact, the world's leading semiconductor foundry recently announced an investment of $3 billion for a new 300-millimeter wafer fab in this park, scheduled commenced production of 16-nanometer [ph] technology in 2018.
We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on our taking the lead operational improvement initiatives. We've seen positive results across all regions and are encouraged by the actions and the behaviors that will enable us to deliver our second $300 million commitment. For example, to improve distribution efficiency, we are optimizing delivery parameters, such as outbound and inbound way, customer delivery restrictions and tank size. Many teams impact distribution efficiency and our regional incentive plan helps to align their efforts.
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our double-digit EBITDA and operating income improvements were driven by our combined focus on self-help operational improvements and the benefits of last year's restructuring actions. Sales of $832 million were down 7% versus last year as the passthrough of lower energy prices reduced sales by 5% and currency reduced sales by 2%.
Overall, Americas volumes were down 1% as Latin American volumes, being down midteens, negatively impacted overall Americas by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. In contrast, North America volumes were up, contributing a positive 1% to our overall Americas volume as we saw the benefit of our new hydrogen plant in Canada and strong hydrogen demand in the U.S. Gulf coast. The new Canadian plant is running well and we anticipate increased profit contributions from this plant as an additional customer comes on stream in late 2017.
Overall volumes were down. I'd like to make 3 points on this. First, same customer volumes year-on-year were up slightly. Second, we're beginning to lap last year's decline in the Oilfield Services business. However, this is still a headwind for us this quarter. And third, we have not yet seen an improvement in the steel business.
Pricing was up 1%, with particular success in Latin America. Operating income of $235 million was up 14% and EBITDA of $362 million was up 11% versus last year as the benefits of our operational improvements and restructuring actions more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy passthrough. We set another record operating margin this time of 28.2%, up over 500 basis points and another record EBITDA margin of 43.5%, up 700 basis points.
Lower energy passthrough accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up over 400 basis points, excluding the lower energy passthrough.
Now please turn to Slide 14. For our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our operational improvements, restructuring and price actions more than offsetting volume because and currency headwinds as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $427 million were down 6% due to a negative 5% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% currency impact. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes down 1% on weakness in the U.K. Ireland and in central Europe, partially offset by slight positive demand in Southern Europe.
Given the timing of the Brexit vote, we don't believe it impacted this quarter. But certainly -- but uncertainly has increased going forward. Prices were up 1%, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive pricing, despite the weak economy and low inflation. We continue to focus our efforts on ensuring that each customer is profitable for our business.
Operating income of $103 million was up 18% and EBITDA of $160 million was up 9% as our productivity and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 24.2% and record EBITDA margin of 37.4% were both up over 500 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for 100 basis points of that, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 400 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 16, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction actions drove significant profit growth this quarter. Sales of $448 million were up 7%, primarily driven by volumes of 14%, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan and a negative 2% price impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue. Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was up double digits. That said, we expect the overall supply conditions in China to remain for some time, certainly through at least next year. Sequential volume increase of 10% was driven by seasonal recovery from the Lunar New Year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Pricing was down 2% versus last year as we continue to see a moderating rate of decline in China LOX/LIN pricing, however, we have seen more price pressure in helium. Operating income of $118 million was up 17%, and EBITDA of $182 million was up 10% as our productivity actions and stronger volume more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 26.4% was up over 200 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.7% was up over 100 basis points.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units, sales equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $100 million of revenue from the ASU sale of equipment. That more than offset weakness in the small equipment and other ASU sales. Segments profits improved on lower costs and a few nonrecurring items last year.
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

As Scott mentioned, we are making great progress on both the sale of our Performance Materials business and the spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. You can see that Materials Technologies continues to show strong results. Given where we are on our separation journey, I'm going to focus my comments today at the division level. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Performance Materials division.
Sales, up $277 million, were flat as 4% higher volumes were offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume is driven by strength in our epoxy end markets, including wind, adhesives and flooring and improved Polyurethane Additives volume across most markets. This was offset by Specialty Additives weakness, due to lower oil and gas related activity and the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil.
Overall, prices were down driven by broader petrochemical driven deflation but were more than margin offset by lower raw material costs.
Performance Materials EBITDA of $69 million was up 6% and operating income of $63 million was up 9%. EBITDA margins of 24.9% was up 130 basis points and operating margins of 22.7% was up 180 basis points primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balances.
Please turn to Slide 18. Versum Materials, the planned spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. As I shared with you in June, I'm very excited to be responsible for Versum Materials, a company with solid growth, high margins, low capital intensity and very highest see.
Versum is a very strong business, both from a market leadership and financial perspective. We operate in the semiconductor space, which will present us with exciting and profitable growth opportunities. We are being set up for success. It's a good company that will have the capability to profitably grow organically and inorganically. And finally, our team is very excited about the opportunity to be the best-in-class pure play electronic materials company.
On Slide 19, you can see the historical EBITDA margin for our EMD business as reported within our products. As you can see, the sustainable and fundamental changes we made to our business will allow us to deliver strong margins into the future.
Let's take a look at the results for this quarter on Slide 20. Please remember, these financials are for EMD as reported within Air Products. Our team delivered another strong quarter, proving we're staying focused on servicing our customers and driving operational improvements, while we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our customers.
Sales of $243 million were down 8% on 6% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 2% negative currency effect. As you can see, all of the negative volume impact was due to Delivery Systems. As expected, Delivery Systems was down significantly compared to high level of project activity last year. But this level of activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of last year, so it won't be a significant headwind next quarter.
Overall, materials volumes were flat [ph] as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business partially offset by softer volumes in our Process Materials. Although the foundry market has been soft in the first part of the year, we're seeing improvements in demand from our foundry customers in the last few months.
EBITDA of $86 million was down 7% and operating income of $73 million was down 5% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.3% and operating margins of 30% were both up modestly. Pricing, mix and the benefit of our operational improvement actions were more than offset by headwinds from currency and the lower Delivery Systems volumes.
Before I turn the call over to George to discuss our financials, let me just say that we look forward to more discussions with you about our very exciting Versum Materials business in the next few months leading up to our spinoff.
Now let me pass the call over to George Bitto, our future CFO for Versum Materials. George?"

Please turn to Slide 21, where you can see the updated trailing 12 months results for EMD. Remember, this is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any corporate costs that are not business specific.
Sales of almost $1 billion and EBITDA margins of 36% continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins.
As part of our preparation for the spinoff, we filed an update to our Form 10 with the SEC last week. And we provided a few slides today to help you extract the key information from the Form 10. These slides are available on our website.
Given the requirements of the Form 10, there are a few different financial basis that I want to take a moment to explain. First, there are the financials you have seen reported for EMD within Air Products. Again, it's important to remember that Air Products does not allocate any nonbusiness specific corporate costs into the business segments. Second, the Form 10 includes Versum audited combined financial statements. The most significant difference between these and the EMD financials is the allocation of Air Products' corporate costs to Versum. And finally, the Form 10 also includes Versum unaudited pro forma financial statements for FY '15 and the first half of FY '16, which includes adjustments to reflect Versum on a post separation basis.
The 2 major areas of adjustments to point out are: a few small product lines that are currently reported in EMD, which will stay with Air Products after the spin. It's about $22 million of sales and about $11 million of profit per year. And the impact of $1.15 billion of debt, down slightly from the $1.25 billion we've talked about in the past.
We continue to believe that Versum will operate very successfully with an initial debt ratio in the fourth -- 3x to 4x EBITDA range. We will continue to refine our thoughts on the right debt and leverage levels to support Versum's very opportunity as we move closer to the spin.
Now please turn to Slide 22. Given the various financials and a variety of time frames, we suggest that the most relevant cash flow numbers are shown on this slide. As referenced in the footnote, we start with $344 million of EBITDA as reported for EMD for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2016, the same $344 million you saw in the previous slide. We subtract about $20 million of EBITDA for adjustments to get to Versum standalone, including public company costs. This adjustment includes about $15 million of expected new costs and about $5 million that was previously included as a noncash depreciation charge. And then, we take out about $11 million of EBITDA, primarily for products that will stay with Air Products, resulting in a revised trailing 12 months EBITDA of $313 million. Assuming a 6% interest rate on the $1.15 billion of debt and factoring in estimated cash taxes and capital spending, you can see that Versum generates a very high level of free cash flow, about $165 million that we can use to grow our business.

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point Strategic Plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company the world.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.91 to $2.01. At midpoint, this will be an increase of about 7% over fourth quarter of last year.
Our full year fiscal '16 guidance is now at $7.45 to $7.55. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 14% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 [ph] performance and is $0.13 or almost 2% higher than the annual guidance we gave you in October of last year.
We now expect our CapEx to be no more than $1.2 billion for the year.
As you can see from our results, we improved our cash flow by almost $100 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows. Number one, maintaining our A [ph] credit ratings, that means we pay down debt to make sure we have an A [ph] credit rating. Number 2, invest in good projects and accretive acquisitions. We are very excited about the opportunities in our core industrial gadgets business. Petrochemical investments in the U.S. Gulf coast, refinery hydrogen plans around the world, and oxygen for coal gasification in China present key growth opportunities for us and believe Air Products is very well-positioned to win profitable for these very large plants. And number 3 priority for use of cash is continuing, as we have, to increase our dividend. And number 4, if there is any excess cash available, we are very comfortable in returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. At the end of the day, the cash we generate belongs to our shareholders and we will only spend it if we have high return projects or good acquisitions.

Thank you for taking time from your busiest schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition",1231,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busiest schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technologies business, who will be the future CEO of Versum Materials; and Mr. George Bitto, Vice President, Finance for Materials Technologies, who will be the future CFO of Versum Materials. All of us will be participating in the call and answering your questions.
I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic Five-Point plan. We delivered earnings per share of $1.92, which is up 16% over last year, and it is the eighth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth.
We also improved our EBITDA margin by more than 300 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 200 basis points to 13.5%. I do want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be the best in the industry.
As we move closer to the sale of our Performance Materials Division to Evonik and the tax-free spinoff of our Electronics Materials Division, now called Versum to our shareholders, we see great opportunities ahead to win key projects and invest in our core industrial gadgets business, so that we grow Air Products in the years to come.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our quarter 3 safety performance was better than last year and last quarter. But I do want to mention that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home after a hard day work with no injuries or incidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the statement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident that we can focus and continue to improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our Five-Point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on executing our Five-Point plan. The first point of the plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. And therefore, we are in the process of divesting our noncore businesses. As Scott, Guillermo and George will provide you details, but we are making great progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik, and we expect that the deal will close before the end of this calendar year. And we are well on our way to the tax-free spin-off of Electronics Materials to our shareholders as Versum Materials. These transactions will be excellent for the employees of all 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business, PMD employees will be core to a world-class materials company at Evonik, and EMD employees will be an independent best-in-class electronics material company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe that these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process is to review every capital investment of more than $3 million. It means we have visibility and control to ensure we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our new projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
I am very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in large on-site and hydrogen plants.
In addition, the separation of PMD and EMD from Air Products will leave $20 million -- will leave about $20 million of stranded cost at Air Products. We are committed to eliminating additional work to offset these costs within a year of closing the transactions I mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details. But I want to emphasize that the operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefits of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results, despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #8. You can see quarter-by-quarter our progress during the last 2 years. You will note that we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900, yes, 900 basis points. This single chart is a great example of the focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now please turn to Slide #9. This single slide, again, truly captures the essence of what the people of Air Products have achieved. Two years ago, we announced that our collective goal was to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these financial metrics. The conventional wisdom at the time was that it cannot be done. That Air Products did not have the portfolio of businesses or so-called density to achieve this goal. But the people of Air Products rolled up their sleeves, went to work and said, ""Yes, we can."" So today, Air Products has the best EBITDA margin in the industry at 34.2%, the highest EBIT margin in the industry at 23% and the highest return on capital employed margin at 13.5%. Every single one of our 19,000 people have contributed to moving us forward to be the best in the industry. And let me tell you, our people are determined to maintain our leader -- leading position in the years to come.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, George and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,370193094,1015595,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the 2 transactions Seifi mentioned.In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close th",932,"Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the 2 transactions Seifi mentioned.
In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close this transaction by the end of calendar 2016. And we are working hard to meet that goal, subject to the various required approvals. We are working closely with Evonik on antitrust and other critical steps and are moving as quickly as possible. Second is the spinoff of EMD as Versum Materials. We said we are targeting to separate the EMD business from Air Products by September and to spinoff Versum as an independent publicly-traded company in October. We are working hard to meet this goal, including completing a variety of legal entity separations and tax activities. George will talk about an important step in this process, the filing of the Form 10, which we did last week. And while no one can predict what will happen in the markets, we are comfortable that at least today, the markets would be conducive to proceeding with the spin. So although we have a lot more work to do, at this point, subject to the timing of a pending regulatory approval, we're optimistic we will be ready to execute the spinoff in October.
Now please turn to Slide 10. For our third quarter, sales of $2.4 billion decreased 1% versus last year on lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 3% and 2%, respectively. Volumes were 4% higher primarily due to our Jazan project. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia and North America, offset by economic weakness in South America and Europe.
Pricing was unchanged as positive pricing in Gases Americas and Europe was offset by lower pricing in Asia and Performance Materials due to lower raw material costs.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $833 million improved by 10% and operating income improved to -- of $560 million improved by 16%, despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin of 34.2% and operating margin of 23%, both improved by 340 basis points, as we continue to execute on our Five-Point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies delivered margin improvement. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 50 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Excluding the impact of energy pass-through, operating margin improved about 290 basis points, primarily from the benefit of self-help actions we have taken and a modest benefit from price and lower raw material costs.
Versus prior year, net income increased by 17% and earnings per share grew 16%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13.5% on our higher profitability.
Now please turn to Slide 11. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow. So we are pleased to see that our free cash flow was $191 million this quarter, up $95 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. As a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning now to Slide 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.29 per share. We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $10 million or $0.04 per share primary for legal and other advisory fees. As a result of our decision to separate MT, we declared a dividend to repatriate $444 million from a subsidiary in South Korea, resulting in an income tax cost of $46 million or $0.21 per share. We have recognized this booked cost in Q3 because that's when the decision was made. However, the cash flow impact will be seen in Q4 when we actually pay the tax. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of restructuring. And now we are focused on our second $300 million of operational improvements. We incurred a $15 million or $0.04 per share charge associated with these operational improvement actions, and this included a $1 million pension settlement charge. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.92 increased $0.26 per share or 16% versus last year. The impact from volumes increased EPS by $0.01 per share. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.04, partially driven by lower raw material costs.
Net cost performance was $0.25 favorable, in part due to the benefit of our operational improvements and from last year's restructuring actions. 
Cost performance also benefited about $0.15, primarily from lower incentive compensation and lower pension costs. Currency was $0.05 unfavorable as many currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity-affiliated income was unchanged. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Taxes were modestly lower contributing $0.01 to earnings.
For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, though likely closer to 25%.
Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 favorable, primarily due to our increased ownership position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced our diluted EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

I'm pleased to present another quarter of very strong results and would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for staying focused on the things we control. Our commitment to driving operational productivity, while staying focused on safety allowed us to overcome currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions to deliver another great quarter. In addition, we are very excited that we continue to compete for and win key projects that will support Industrial Gases growth into the future.
Just last week, we announced a new plan to provide ultrahigh purity gases to customers in the Pukou Economic Development Zone in Nanjing, China. The Pukou Economic Development Zone is a state-level park, that will be home to semiconductor and other high-tech manufacturing. In fact, the world's leading semiconductor foundry recently announced an investment of $3 billion for a new 300-millimeter wafer fab in this park, scheduled commenced production of 16-nanometer technology in 2018.
We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on our taking-the-lead operational improvement initiatives. We've seen positive results across all regions and are encouraged by the actions and the behaviors that will enable us to deliver our second $300 million commitment. For example, to improve distribution efficiency, we are optimizing delivery parameters, such as outbound and inbound way, customer delivery restrictions and tank sizing. Many teams impact distribution efficiency, and our regional incentive plan helps to align their efforts.
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our double-digit EBITDA and operating income improvements were driven by our combined focus on self-help operational improvements and the benefits of last year's restructuring actions. Sales of $832 million were down 7% versus last year, as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 5% and currency reduced sales by 2%.
Overall, Americas volumes were down 1% as Latin American volumes, being down midteens, negatively impacted overall Americas by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. In contrast, North America volumes were up, contributing a positive 1% to our overall Americas volume, as we saw the benefit of our new hydrogen plant in Canada and strong hydrogen demand in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The new Canadian plant is running well, and we anticipate increased profit contributions from this plant as an additional customer comes on stream in late 2017.
Overall volumes were down. I'd like to make 3 points on this. First, same customer volumes year-on-year were up slightly. Second, we're beginning to lap last year's decline in the Oilfield Services business. However, this is still a headwind for us this quarter. And third, we have not yet seen an improvement in the steel business.
Pricing was up 1%, with particular success in Latin America. Operating income of $235 million was up 14% and EBITDA of $362 million was up 11% versus last year, as the benefits of our operational improvements and restructuring actions more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. We set another record operating margin this time of 28.2%, up over 500 basis points and another record EBITDA margin of 43.5%, up 700 basis points.
Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up over 400 basis points, excluding the lower energy pass-through.
Now please turn to Slide 14. For our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our operational improvements, restructuring and price actions more than offsetting volume weakness and currency headwinds, as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $427 million were down 6% due to a negative 5% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% currency impact. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes down 1% on weakness in the U.K.-Ireland and in central Europe, partially offset by slight positive demand in Southern Europe.
Given the timing of the Brexit vote, we don't believe it impacted this quarter. But certainly -- I'm sorry, but uncertainty has clearly increased going forward. Prices were up 1%, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive pricing, despite the weak economy and low inflation. We continue to focus our efforts on ensuring that each customer is profitable for our business.
Operating income of $103 million was up 18% and EBITDA of $160 million was up 9% as our productivity and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 24.2% and record EBITDA margin of 37.4% were both up over 500 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for 100 basis points of that, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 400 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction actions drove significant profit growth this quarter. Sales of $448 million were up 7%, primarily driven by volumes of 14%, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan and a negative 2% price impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue. Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia, and our China retail LOX/LIN business was up double digits. That said, we expect the oversupply conditions in China to remain for some time is certainly through at least next year. Sequential volume increase of 10% was driven by a seasonal recovery from the Lunar New Year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Pricing was down 2% versus last year, as we continue to see a moderating rate of decline in China LOX/LIN/LAR pricing. However, we have seen more price pressure in helium. Operating income of $118 million was up 17%, and EBITDA of $182 million was up 10% as our productivity actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 26.4% was up over 200 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 40.7% was up over 100 basis points.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sales equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region-specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment. That more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segments profits improved on lower costs and a few nonrecurring items last year.
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

Sales, up $277 million, were flat as 4% higher volumes were offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by strength in our epoxy end markets, including wind, adhesives and flooring, and improved Polyurethane Additives volume across most markets. This was offset by Specialty Additives weakness, due to lower oil and gas-related activity and the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil.
Overall, prices were down driven by broader petrochemical driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs.
Performance Materials, EBITDA of $69 million, was up 6%, and operating income of $63 million was up 9%. EBITDA margins of 24.9% was up 130 basis points and operating margins of 22.7% was up 180 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balances.
Please turn to Slide 18. Versum Materials, the planned spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. As I shared with you in June, I'm very excited to be responsible for Versum Materials, a company with solid growth, high margins, low capital intensity and very high free cash flow.
Versum is a very strong business, both from a market leadership and financial perspective. We operate in the semiconductor space, which will present us with exciting and profitable growth opportunities. We are being set up for success. It's a good company that will have the capability to profitably grow organically and inorganically. And finally, our team is very excited about the opportunity to be the best-in-class, pure-play electronic materials company.
On Slide 19, you can see the historical EBITDA margin for our EMD business as reported within our products. As you can see, the sustainable and fundamental changes we made to our business will allow us to deliver strong margins into the future.
Let's take a look at the results for this quarter on Slide 20. Please remember, these financials are for EMD as reported within Air Products. Our team delivered another strong quarter, proving we're staying focused on servicing our customers and driving operational improvements, while we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our customers.
Sales of $243 million were down 8% on 6% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 2% negative currency effect. As you can see, all of the negative volume impact was due to Delivery Systems. As expected, Delivery Systems was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. But this level of activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of last year, so it won't be a significant headwind next quarter.
Overall, materials volumes were flat, as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business, partially offset by softer volumes in our Process Materials. Although the foundry market has been soft in the first part of the year, we're seeing improvements in demand from our foundry customers in the last few months.
EBITDA of $86 million was down 7%, and operating income of $73 million was down 5% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.3% and operating margins of 30% were both up modestly. Pricing, mix and the benefit of our operational improvement actions were more than offset by headwinds from currency and the lower Delivery Systems volumes.
Before I turn the call over to George to discuss our financials, let me just say that we look forward to more discussions with you about our very exciting Versum Materials business in the next few months leading up to our spinoff.
Now let me pass the call over to George Bitto, our future CFO for Versum Materials. George?"

Please turn to Slide 21, where you can see the updated trailing 12 months results for EMD. Remember, this is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any corporate costs that are not business-specific.
Sales of almost $1 billion and EBITDA margins of 36% continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins.
As part of our preparation for the spinoff, we filed an update to our Form 10 with the SEC last week. And we provided a few slides today to help you extract the key information from the Form 10. These slides are available on our website.
Given the requirements of the Form 10, there are a few different financial bases, that I wanted to take a moment to explain. First, there are the financials you have seen reported for EMD within Air Products. Again, it's important to remember that Air Products does not allocate any nonbusiness specific corporate costs into the business segments. Second, the Form 10 includes Versum-audited combined financial statements. The most significant difference between these and the EMD financials is the allocation of Air Products' corporate costs to Versum. And finally, the Form 10 also includes Versum unaudited pro forma financial statements for FY '15 and the first half of FY '16, which includes adjustments to reflect Versum on a postseparation basis.
The 2 major areas of adjustments to point out are: a few small product lines that are currently reported in EMD, which will stay with Air Products after the spin. It's about $22 million of sales and about $11 million of profit per year. And the impact of $1.15 billion of debt, down slightly from the $1.25 billion we've talked about in the past.
We continue to believe that Versum will operate very successfully, with an initial debt ratio in the 4x -- 3x to 4x EBITDA range. We will continue to refine our thoughts on the right debt and leverage levels to support Versum's very exciting growth opportunities, as we move closer to the spin.
Now please turn to Slide 22. Given the various financials in a variety of time frames, we suggest that the most relevant cash flow numbers are shown on this slide. As referenced in the footnote, we start with $344 million of EBITDA as reported for EMD for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2016, the same $344 million you saw on the previous slide. We subtract about $20 million of EBITDA for adjustments to get to Versum standalone, including public company costs. This adjustment includes about $15 million of expected new costs and about $5 million that was previously included as a noncash depreciation charge. And then, we take out about $11 million of EBITDA, primarily for products that will stay with Air Products, resulting in a revised trailing 12 months EBITDA of $313 million. Assuming a 6% interest rate on the $1.15 billion of debt and factoring in estimated cash taxes and capital spending, you can see that Versum generates a very high level of free cash flow, about $165 million that we can use to grow our business.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our Corporate segment."

Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business-specific.
Sales were down versus this year on lower LNG project activity, and profits were about flat as lower costs offset the lower sales.
As we've said, we've not seen delays or cancellations of any major equipment orders in our backlog. But the lack of customer decisions on new projects will impact our FY '16 and FY '17 results. This is likely to be about a $0.10 headwind in FY '16 versus FY '15 and will be an additional headwind for us in FY '17.

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earning per share of $1.91 to $2.01. At midpoint, this will be an increase of about 7% over fourth quarter of last year.
Our full year fiscal '16 guidance is now at $7.45 to $7.55. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 14% over our very strong fiscal year 25 [ph] performance and is $0.13 or almost 2% higher than the annual guidance we gave you in October of last year.
We now expect our CapEx to be no more than $1.2 billion for the year.
As you can see from our results, we improved our cash flow by almost $100 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating, that means we pay down debt to make sure that we have an A credit rating; number two, invest in good projects and accretive acquisitions. We are very excited about the opportunities in our core industrial gadgets business. Petrochemical investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, refinery hydrogen plants around the world and oxygen for coal gasification in China present key growth opportunities for us, and we believe Air Products is very well positioned to win profitabilities for these very large plants. And number three priority for use of cash is continuing, as we have, to increase our dividend. And number four, if there is any excess cash available, we are very comfortable in returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. At the end of the day, the cash we generate belongs to our shareholders, and we will only spend it if we have high-return projects or good acquisitions.
And now we will all be delighted to answer your questions."

The fact that we have cash gives us a lot of power to do things, but at the same time, we are not ready to just go burn it up just because we have the cash."

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to",1232,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products.
First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technologies business, who will be the future CEO of Versum Materials; and Mr. George Bitto, Vice President, Finance for Materials Technologies, who will be the future CFO of Versum Materials. All of us will be participating in the call and answering your questions.
I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic Five-Point plan. We delivered earnings per share of $1.92, which is up 16% over last year, and it is the eighth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth.
We also improved our EBITDA margin by more than 300 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 200 basis points to 13.5%. I do want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be the best in the industry.
As we move closer to the sale of our Performance Materials Division to Evonik and the tax-free spinoff of our Electronics Materials Division, now called Versum to our shareholders, we see great opportunities ahead to win key projects and invest in our core industrial gadgets business, so that we grow Air Products in the years to come.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our quarter 3 safety performance was better than last year and last quarter. But I do want to mention that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents. We have the responsibility to Air Products employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home after a hard day at work with no injuries or incidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the statement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident that we can focus and continue to improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our Five-Point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on executing our Five-Point plan. The first point of the plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. And therefore, we are in the process of divesting our noncore businesses. As Scott, Guillermo and George will provide you details, but we are making great progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik, and we expect that the deal will close before the end of this calendar year. And we are well on our way to the tax-free spin-off of Electronics Materials to our shareholders at Versum Materials. These transactions will be excellent for the employees of all 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business, PMD employees will be core to a world-class materials company at Evonik, and EMD employees will be an independent best-in-class electronics material company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe that these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process is to review every capital investment of more than $3 million, means we have visibility and control to ensure we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our new projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
I am very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in large on-site and hydrogen plants.
In addition, the separation of PMD and EMD from Air Products will leave $20 million -- will leave about $20 million of stranded cost at Air Products. We are committed to eliminating additional work to offset these costs within a year of closing the transactions I mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details. But I want to emphasize that the operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefits of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results, despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #8. You can see quarter-by-quarter our progress during the last 2 years. You will note that we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900, yes, 900 basis points. This single chart is a great example of the focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now please turn to Slide #9. This single slide, again, truly captures the essence of what the people of Air Products have achieved. Two years ago, we announced that our collective goal was to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these financial metrics. The conventional wisdom at the time was that it cannot be done. That Air Products did not have the portfolio of businesses or so-called density to achieve this goal. But the people of Air Products rolled up their sleeves, went to work and said, ""Yes, we can."" So today, Air Products has the best EBITDA margin in the industry at 34.2%, the highest EBIT margin in the industry at 23% and the highest return on capital employed margin at 13.5%. Every single one of our 19,000 people have contributed to moving us forward to be the best in the industry. And let me tell you, our people are determined to maintain our leader -- leading position in the years to come.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, George and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,370193094,1015800,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi.

We said we expect to close th",931,"Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the 2 transactions Seifi mentioned.
In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close this transaction by the end of calendar 2016. And we are working hard to meet that goal, subject to the various required approvals. We are working closely with Evonik on antitrust and other critical steps and are moving as quickly as possible. Second is the spinoff of EMD as Versum Materials. We said we are targeting to separate the EMD business from Air Products by September and to spinoff Versum as an independent publicly-traded company in October. We are working hard to meet this goal, including completing a variety of legal entity separations and tax activities. George will talk about an important step in this process, the filing of the Form 10, which we did last week. And while no one can predict what will happen in the markets, we are comfortable that at least today, the markets would be conducive to proceeding with the spin. So although we have a lot more work to do, at this point, subject to the timing of obtaining regulatory approval, we're optimistic we will be ready to execute the spinoff in October.
Now please turn to Slide 10. For our third quarter, sales of $2.4 billion decreased 1% versus last year on lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 3% and 2%, respectively. Volumes were 4% higher primarily due to our Jazan project. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia and North America, offset by economic weakness in South America and Europe.
Pricing was unchanged as positive pricing in Gases Americas and Europe was offset by lower pricing in Asia and Performance Materials due to lower raw material costs.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $833 million improved by 10% and operating income improved to -- of $560 million improved by 16%, despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin of 34.2% and operating margin of 23%, both improved by 340 basis points, as we continued to execute on our Five-Point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies delivered margin improvement. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 50 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Excluding the impact of energy pass-through, operating margin improved about 290 basis points, primarily from the benefit of self-help actions we have taken and a modest benefit from price and lower raw material costs.
Versus prior year, net income increased by 17% and earnings per share grew 16%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13.5% on our higher profitability.
Now please turn to Slide 11. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow. So we are pleased to see that our free cash flow was $191 million this quarter, up $95 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. As a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning now to Slide 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.29 per share. We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $10 million or $0.04 per share primary for legal and other advisory fees. As a result of our decision to separate MT, we declared a dividend to repatriate $444 million from a subsidiary in South Korea, resulting in an income tax cost of $46 million or $0.21 per share. We have recognized this book cost in Q3 because that's when the decision was made. However, the cash flow impact will be seen in Q4 when we actually pay the tax. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of restructuring. And now we are focused on our second $300 million of operational improvements. We incurred a $15 million or $0.04 per share charge associated with these operational improvement actions, and this included a $1 million pension settlement charge. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.92 increased $0.26 per share or 16% versus last year. The impact from volumes increased EPS by $0.01 per share. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.04, partially driven by lower raw material costs.
Net cost performance was $0.25 favorable, in part due to the benefit of our operational improvements and from last year's restructuring actions. 
Cost performance also benefited about $0.15, primarily from lower incentive compensation and lower pension costs. Currency was $0.05 unfavorable as many currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity-affiliated income was unchanged. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Taxes were modestly lower contributing $0.01 to earnings.
For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, though likely closer to 25%.
Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 favorable, primarily due to our increased ownership position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced our diluted EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

I'm pleased to present another quarter of very strong results and would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for staying focused on the things we control. Our commitment to driving operational productivity, while staying focused on safety allowed us to overcome currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions to deliver another great quarter. In addition, we are very excited that we continue to compete for and win key projects that will support Industrial Gases growth into the future.
Just last week, we announced a new plan to provide ultrahigh purity gases to customers in the Pukou Economic Development Zone in Nanjing, China. The Pukou Economic Development Zone is a state-level park, that will be home to semiconductor and other high-tech manufacturing. In fact, the world's leading semiconductor foundry recently announced an investment of $3 billion for a new 300-millimeter wafer fab in this park with scheduled commenced production of 16-nanometer technology in 2018.
We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on our taking-the-lead operational improvement initiatives. We've seen positive results across all regions and are encouraged by the actions and the behaviors that will enable us to deliver our second $300 million commitment. For example, to improve distribution efficiency, we are optimizing delivery parameters, such as outbound and inbound weight, customer delivery restrictions and tank sizing. Many teams impact distribution efficiency, and our regional incentive plan helps to align their efforts.
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our double-digit EBITDA and operating income improvements were driven by our combined focus on self-help operational improvements and the benefits of last year's restructuring actions. Sales of $832 million were down 7% versus last year, as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 5% and currency reduced sales by 2%.
Overall, Americas volumes were down 1% as Latin American volumes, being down midteens, negatively impacted overall Americas by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. In contrast, North America volumes were up, contributing a positive 1% to our overall Americas volume, as we saw the benefit of our new hydrogen plant in Canada and strong hydrogen demand in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The new Canadian plant is running well, and we anticipate increased profit contributions from this plant as an additional customer comes on stream in late 2017.
Overall LOX/LIN volumes were down. I'd like to make 3 points on this. First, same customer volumes year-on-year were up slightly. Second, we're beginning to lap last year's decline in the Oilfield Services business. However, this is still a headwind for us this quarter. And third, we have not yet seen an improvement in the steel business.
Pricing was up 1%, with particular success in Latin America. Operating income of $235 million was up 14% and EBITDA of $362 million was up 11% versus last year, as the benefits of our operational improvements and restructuring actions more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. We set another record operating margin this time of 28.2%, up over 500 basis points and another record EBITDA margin of 43.5%, up 700 basis points.
Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up over 400 basis points, excluding the lower energy pass-through.
Now please turn to Slide 14. For our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our operational improvements, restructuring and price actions more than offsetting volume weakness and currency headwinds, as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $427 million were down 6% due to a negative 5% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% currency impact. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes down 1% on weakness in the U.K.-Ireland and in central Europe, partially offset by slight positive demand in Southern Europe.
Given the timing of the Brexit vote, we don't believe it impacted this quarter. But certainly -- I'm sorry, but uncertainty has clearly increased going forward. Prices were up 1%, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive pricing, despite the weak economy and low inflation. We continue to focus our efforts on ensuring that each customer is profitable for our business.
Operating income of $103 million was up 18% and EBITDA of $160 million was up 9% as our productivity and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 24.2% and record EBITDA margin of 37.4% were both up over 500 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for 100 basis points of that, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 400 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction actions drove significant profit growth this quarter. Sales of $448 million were up 7%, primarily driven by volumes of 14%, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan and a negative 2% price impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue. Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia, and our China retail LOX/LIN business was up double digits. That said, we expect the oversupply conditions in China to remain for some time, certainly through at least next year. Sequential volume increase of 10% was driven by a seasonal recovery from the Lunar New Year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Pricing was down 2% versus last year, as we continue to see a moderating rate of decline in China LOX/LIN/LAR pricing. However, we have seen more price pressure in helium. Operating income of $118 million was up 17%, and EBITDA of $182 million was up 10% as our productivity actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 26.4% was up over 200 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 40.7% was up over 100 basis points.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sales equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region-specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment. That more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segments profits improved on lower costs and a few nonrecurring items last year.
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

As Scott mentioned, we are making great progress on both the sale of our Performance Materials business and the spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. You can see that Materials Technologies continues to show strong results. Given where we are on our separation journey, I'm going to focus my comments today at the division level. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Performance Materials division.
Sales, up $277 million, were flat as 4% higher volumes were offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by strength in our epoxy end markets, including wind, adhesives and flooring, and improved Polyurethane Additives volume across most markets. This was offset by Specialty Additives weakness, due to lower oil and gas-related activity and the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil.
Overall, prices were down driven by broader petrochemical driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs.
Performance Materials, EBITDA of $69 million, was up 6%, and operating income of $63 million was up 9%. EBITDA margins of 24.9% was up 130 basis points and operating margins of 22.7% was up 180 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balances.
Please turn to Slide 18. Versum Materials, the planned spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. As I shared with you in June, I'm very excited to be responsible for Versum Materials, a company with solid growth, high margins, low capital intensity and very high free cash flow.
Versum is a very strong business, both from a market leadership and financial perspective. We operate in the semiconductor space, which will present us with exciting and profitable growth opportunities. We are being set up for success. It's a good company that will have the capability to profitably grow organically and inorganically. And finally, our team is very excited about the opportunity to be the best-in-class, pure-play electronic materials company.
On Slide 19, you can see the historical EBITDA margin for our EMD business as reported within our products. As you can see, the sustainable and fundamental changes we made to our business will allow us to deliver strong margins into the future.
Let's take a look at the results for this quarter on Slide 20. Please remember, these financials are for EMD as reported within Air Products. Our team delivered another strong quarter, proving we're staying focused on servicing our customers and driving operational improvements, while we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our customers.
Sales of $243 million were down 8% on 6% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 2% negative currency effect. As you can see, all of the negative volume impact was due to Delivery Systems. As expected, Delivery Systems was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. But this level of activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of last year, so it won't be a significant headwind next quarter.
Overall, materials volumes were flat, as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business, partially offset by softer volumes in our Process Materials. Although the foundry market has been soft in the first part of the year, we're seeing improvements in demand from our foundry customers in the last few months.
EBITDA of $86 million was down 7%, and operating income of $73 million was down 5% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.3% and operating margins of 30% were both up modestly. Pricing, mix and the benefit of our operational improvement actions were more than offset by headwinds from currency and the lower Delivery Systems volumes.
Before I turn the call over to George to discuss our financials, let me just say that we look forward to more discussions with you about our very exciting Versum Materials business in the next few months leading up to our spinoff.
Now let me pass the call over to George Bitto, our future CFO for Versum Materials. George?"

Please turn to Slide 21, where you can see the updated trailing 12 months results for EMD. Remember, this is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any corporate costs that are not business-specific.
Sales of almost $1 billion and EBITDA margins of 36% continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins.
As part of our preparation for the spinoff, we filed an update to our Form 10 with the SEC last week. And we provided a few slides today to help you extract the key information from the Form 10. These slides are available on our website.
Given the requirements of the Form 10, there are a few different financial bases, that I wanted to take a moment to explain. First, there are the financials you have seen reported for EMD within Air Products. Again, it's important to remember that Air Products does not allocate any nonbusiness specific corporate costs into the business segments. Second, the Form 10 includes Versum-audited combined financial statements. The most significant difference between these and the EMD financials is the allocation of Air Products' corporate costs to Versum. And finally, the Form 10 also includes Versum unaudited pro forma financial statements for FY '15 and the first half of FY '16, which includes adjustments to reflect Versum on a postseparation basis.
The 2 major areas of adjustments to point out are: a few small product lines that are currently reported in EMD, which will stay with Air Products after the spin. It's about $22 million of sales and about $11 million of profit per year. And the impact of $1.15 billion of debt, down slightly from the $1.25 billion we've talked about in the past.
We continue to believe that Versum will operate very successfully, with an initial debt ratio in the 4x -- 3x to 4x EBITDA range. We will continue to refine our thoughts on the right debt and leverage levels to support Versum's very exciting growth opportunities, as we move closer to the spin.
Now please turn to Slide 22. Given the various financials in a variety of time frames, we suggest that the most relevant cash flow numbers are shown on this slide. As referenced in the footnote, we start with $344 million of EBITDA as reported for EMD for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2016, the same $344 million you saw on the previous slide. We subtract about $20 million of EBITDA for adjustments to get to Versum standalone, including public company costs. This adjustment includes about $15 million of expected new costs and about $5 million that was previously included as a noncash depreciation charge. And then, we take out about $11 million of EBITDA, primarily for products that will stay with Air Products, resulting in a revised trailing 12 months EBITDA of $313 million. Assuming a 6% interest rate on the $1.15 billion of debt and factoring in estimated cash taxes and capital spending, you can see that Versum generates a very high level of free cash flow, about $165 million that we can use to grow our business.

Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business-specific.
Sales were down versus this year on lower LNG project activity, and profits were about flat as lower costs offset the lower sales.
As we've said, we've not seen delays or cancellations of any major equipment orders in our backlog. But the lack of customer decisions on new projects will impact our FY '16 and FY '17 results. This is likely to be about a $0.10 headwind in FY '16 versus FY '15 and will be an additional headwind for us in FY '17.

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earning per share of $1.91 to $2.01. At midpoint, this will be an increase of about 7% over fourth quarter of last year.
Our full year fiscal '16 guidance is now at $7.45 to $7.55. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 14% over our very strong fiscal year 25 [ph] performance and is $0.13 or almost 2% higher than the annual guidance we gave you in October of last year.
We now expect our CapEx to be no more than $1.2 billion for the year.
As you can see from our results, we improved our cash flow by almost $100 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating, that means we pay down debt to make sure that we have an A credit rating; number two, invest in good projects and accretive acquisitions. We are very excited about the opportunities in our core industrial gadgets business. Petrochemical investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, refinery hydrogen plants around the world and oxygen for coal gasification in China present key growth opportunities for us, and we believe Air Products is very well positioned to win profitable leads for these very large plants. And number three priority for use of cash is continuing, as we have, to increase our dividend. And number four, if there is any excess cash available, we are very comfortable in returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. At the end of the day, the cash we generate belongs to our shareholders, and we will only spend it if we have high-return projects or good acquisitions.

First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technologies business, who will be the future CEO of Versum Materials; and Mr. George Bitto, Vice President, Finance for Materials Technologies, who will be the future CFO of Versum Materials. All of us will be participating in the call and answering your questions.
I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic Five-Point plan. We delivered earnings per share of $1.92, which is up 16% over last year, and it is the eighth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth.
We also improved our EBITDA margin by more than 300 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 200 basis points to 13.5%. I do want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be the best in the industry.
As we move closer to the sale of our Performance Materials Division to Evonik and the tax-free spinoff of our Electronics Materials Division, now called Versum to our shareholders, we see great opportunities ahead to win key projects and invest in our core industrial gadgets business, so that we grow Air Products in the years to come.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our quarter 3 safety performance was better than last year and last quarter. But I do want to mention that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents. We have the responsibility to Air Products employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home after a hard day at work with no injuries or incidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the statement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident that we can focus and continue to improve our performance on the safety side.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our Five-Point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on executing our Five-Point plan. The first point of the plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. And therefore, we are in the process of divesting our noncore businesses. As Scott, Guillermo and George will provide you details, but we are making great progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik, and we expect that the deal will close before the end of this calendar year. And we are well on our way to the tax-free spin-off of Electronics Materials to our shareholders at Versum Materials. These transactions will be excellent for the employees of all 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business, PMD employees will be core to a world-class materials company at Evonik, and EMD employees will be an independent best-in-class electronics material company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe that these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process is to review every capital investment of more than $3 million, means we have visibility and control to ensure we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our new projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years.
I am very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in large on-site and hydrogen plants.
In addition, the separation of PMD and EMD from Air Products will leave $20 million -- will leave about $20 million of stranded cost at Air Products. We are committed to eliminating additional work to offset these costs within a year of closing the transactions I mentioned.
Now please turn to Slide #7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details. But I want to emphasize that the operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefits of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results, despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #8. You can see quarter-by-quarter our progress during the last 2 years. You will note that we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900, yes, 900 basis points. This single chart is a great example of the focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now please turn to Slide #9. This single slide, again, truly captures the essence of what the people of Air Products have achieved. Two years ago, we announced that our collective goal was to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these financial metrics. The conventional wisdom at the time was that it cannot be done. That Air Products did not have the portfolio of businesses or so-called density to achieve this goal. But the people of Air Products rolled up their sleeves, went to work and said, ""Yes, we can."" So today, Air Products has the best EBITDA margin in the industry at 34.2%, the highest EBIT margin in the industry at 23% and the highest return on capital employed margin at 13.5%. Every single one of our 19,000 people have contributed to moving us forward to be the best in the industry. And let me tell you, our people are determined to maintain our leader -- leading position in the years to come.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, George and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,370193094,1017196,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the 2 transactions Seifi mentioned.In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close th",931,"Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the 2 transactions Seifi mentioned.
In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close this transaction by the end of calendar 2016. And we are working hard to meet that goal, subject to the various required approvals. We are working closely with Evonik on antitrust and other critical steps and are moving as quickly as possible. Second is the spinoff of EMD as Versum Materials. We said we are targeting to separate the EMD business from Air Products by September and to spinoff Versum as an independent publicly-traded company in October. We are working hard to meet this goal, including completing a variety of legal entity separations and tax activities. George will talk about an important step in this process, the filing of the Form 10, which we did last week. And while no one can predict what will happen in the markets, we are comfortable that at least today, the markets would be conducive to proceeding with the spin. So although we have a lot more work to do, at this point, subject to the timing of obtaining regulatory approval, we're optimistic we will be ready to execute the spinoff in October.
Now please turn to Slide 10. For our third quarter, sales of $2.4 billion decreased 1% versus last year on lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 3% and 2%, respectively. Volumes were 4% higher primarily due to our Jazan project. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia and North America, offset by economic weakness in South America and Europe.
Pricing was unchanged as positive pricing in Gases Americas and Europe was offset by lower pricing in Asia and Performance Materials due to lower raw material costs.
We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $833 million improved by 10% and operating income improved to -- of $560 million improved by 16%, despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin of 34.2% and operating margin of 23%, both improved by 340 basis points, as we continued to execute on our Five-Point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies delivered margin improvement. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 50 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Excluding the impact of energy pass-through, operating margin improved about 290 basis points, primarily from the benefit of self-help actions we have taken and a modest benefit from price and lower raw material costs.
Versus prior year, net income increased by 17% and earnings per share grew 16%. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13.5% on our higher profitability.
Now please turn to Slide 11. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow. So we are pleased to see that our free cash flow was $191 million this quarter, up $95 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. As a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes.
Turning now to Slide 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.29 per share. We incurred Materials Technologies separation costs of $10 million or $0.04 per share primary for legal and other advisory fees. As a result of our decision to separate MT, we declared a dividend to repatriate $444 million from a subsidiary in South Korea, resulting in an income tax cost of $46 million or $0.21 per share. We have recognized this book cost in Q3 because that's when the decision was made. However, the cash flow impact will be seen in Q4 when we actually pay the tax. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of restructuring. And now we are focused on our second $300 million of operational improvements. We incurred a $15 million or $0.04 per share charge associated with these operational improvement actions, and this included a $1 million pension settlement charge. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.92 increased $0.26 per share or 16% versus last year. The impact from volumes increased EPS by $0.01 per share. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.04, partially driven by lower raw material costs.
Net cost performance was $0.25 favorable, in part due to the benefit of our operational improvements and from last year's restructuring actions. 
Cost performance also benefited about $0.15, primarily from lower incentive compensation and lower pension costs. Currency was $0.05 unfavorable as many currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency.
Equity-affiliated income was unchanged. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Taxes were modestly lower contributing $0.01 to earnings.
For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, though likely closer to 25%.
Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 favorable, primarily due to our increased ownership position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced our diluted EPS by $0.01.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

I'm pleased to present another quarter of very strong results and would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for staying focused on the things we control. Our commitment to driving operational productivity, while staying focused on safety allowed us to overcome currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions to deliver another great quarter. In addition, we are very excited that we continue to compete for and win key projects that will support Industrial Gases growth into the future.
Just last week, we announced a new plan to provide ultrahigh purity gases to customers in the Pukou Economic Development Zone in Nanjing, China. The Pukou Economic Development Zone is a state-level park, that will be home to semiconductor and other high-tech manufacturing. In fact, the world's leading semiconductor foundry recently announced an investment of $3 billion for a new 300-millimeter wafer fab in this park with scheduled commenced production of 16-nanometer technology in 2018.
We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on our taking-the-lead operational improvement initiatives. We've seen positive results across all regions and are encouraged by the actions and the behaviors that will enable us to deliver our second $300 million commitment. For example, to improve distribution efficiency, we are optimizing delivery parameters, such as outbound and inbound weight, customer delivery restrictions and tank sizing. Many teams impact distribution efficiency, and our regional incentive plan helps to align their efforts.
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our double-digit EBITDA and operating income improvements were driven by our combined focus on self-help operational improvements and the benefits of last year's restructuring actions. Sales of $832 million were down 7% versus last year, as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 5% and currency reduced sales by 2%.
Overall, Americas volumes were down 1% as Latin American volumes, being down midteens, negatively impacted overall Americas by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. In contrast, North America volumes were up, contributing a positive 1% to our overall Americas volume, as we saw the benefit of our new hydrogen plant in Canada and strong hydrogen demand in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The new Canadian plant is running well, and we anticipate increased profit contributions from this plant as an additional customer comes on stream in late 2017.
Overall LOX/LIN volumes were down. I'd like to make 3 points on this. First, same customer volumes year-on-year were up slightly. Second, we're beginning to lap last year's decline in the Oilfield Services business. However, this is still a headwind for us this quarter. And third, we have not yet seen an improvement in the steel business.
Pricing was up 1%, with particular success in Latin America. Operating income of $235 million was up 14% and EBITDA of $362 million was up 11% versus last year, as the benefits of our operational improvements and restructuring actions more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. We set another record operating margin this time of 28.2%, up over 500 basis points and another record EBITDA margin of 43.5%, up 700 basis points.
Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up over 400 basis points, excluding the lower energy pass-through.
Now please turn to Slide 14. For our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our operational improvements, restructuring and price actions more than offsetting volume weakness and currency headwinds, as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $427 million were down 6% due to a negative 5% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% currency impact. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes down 1% on weakness in the U.K.-Ireland and in central Europe, partially offset by slight positive demand in Southern Europe.
Given the timing of the Brexit vote, we don't believe it impacted this quarter. But certainly -- I'm sorry, but uncertainty has clearly increased going forward. Prices were up 1%, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive pricing, despite the weak economy and low inflation. We continue to focus our efforts on ensuring that each customer is profitable for our business.
Operating income of $103 million was up 18% and EBITDA of $160 million was up 9% as our productivity and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 24.2% and record EBITDA margin of 37.4% were both up over 500 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for 100 basis points of that, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 400 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 15, Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction actions drove significant profit growth this quarter. Sales of $448 million were up 7%, primarily driven by volumes of 14%, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan and a negative 2% price impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue. Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia, and our China retail LOX/LIN business was up double digits. That said, we expect the oversupply conditions in China to remain for some time, certainly through at least next year. Sequential volume increase of 10% was driven by a seasonal recovery from the Lunar New Year as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Pricing was down 2% versus last year, as we continue to see a moderating rate of decline in China LOX/LIN/LAR pricing. However, we have seen more price pressure in helium. Operating income of $118 million was up 17%, and EBITDA of $182 million was up 10% as our productivity actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price.
Operating margin of 26.4% was up over 200 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 40.7% was up over 100 basis points.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sales equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region-specific.
Sales were up as we recognized about $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment. That more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segments profits improved on lower costs and a few nonrecurring items last year.
Now please turn to Slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results."

As Scott mentioned, we are making great progress on both the sale of our Performance Materials business and the spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. You can see that Materials Technologies continues to show strong results. Given where we are on our separation journey, I'm going to focus my comments today at the division level. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Performance Materials division.
Sales, up $277 million, were flat as 4% higher volumes were offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by strength in our epoxy end markets, including wind, adhesives and flooring, and improved Polyurethane Additives volume across most markets. This was offset by Specialty Additives weakness, due to lower oil and gas-related activity and the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil.
Overall, prices were down driven by broader petrochemical driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs.
Performance Materials, EBITDA of $69 million, was up 6%, and operating income of $63 million was up 9%. EBITDA margins of 24.9% was up 130 basis points and operating margins of 22.7% was up 180 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balances.
Please turn to Slide 18. Versum Materials, the planned spinoff of our Electronics Materials business. As I shared with you in June, I'm very excited to be responsible for Versum Materials, a company with solid growth, high margins, low capital intensity and very high free cash flow.
Versum is a very strong business, both from a market leadership and financial perspective. We operate in the semiconductor space, which will present us with exciting and profitable growth opportunities. We are being set up for success. It's a good company that will have the capability to profitably grow organically and inorganically. And finally, our team is very excited about the opportunity to be the best-in-class, pure-play electronic materials company.
On Slide 19, you can see the historical EBITDA margin for our EMD business as reported within our products. As you can see, the sustainable and fundamental changes we made to our business will allow us to deliver strong margins into the future.
Let's take a look at the results for this quarter on Slide 20. Please remember, these financials are for EMD as reported within Air Products. Our team delivered another strong quarter, proving we're staying focused on servicing our customers and driving operational improvements, while we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our customers.
Sales of $243 million were down 8% on 6% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 2% negative currency effect. As you can see, all of the negative volume impact was due to Delivery Systems. As expected, Delivery Systems was down significantly compared to a high level of project activity last year. But this level of activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of last year, so it won't be a significant headwind next quarter.
Overall, materials volumes were flat, as we continue to see growth in our Advanced Materials business, partially offset by softer volumes in our Process Materials. Although the foundry market has been soft in the first part of the year, we're seeing improvements in demand from our foundry customers in the last few months.
EBITDA of $86 million was down 7%, and operating income of $73 million was down 5% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.3% and operating margins of 30% were both up modestly. Pricing, mix and the benefit of our operational improvement actions were more than offset by headwinds from currency and the lower Delivery Systems volumes.
Before I turn the call over to George to discuss our financials, let me just say that we look forward to more discussions with you about our very exciting Versum Materials business in the next few months leading up to our spinoff.
Now let me pass the call over to George Bitto, our future CFO for Versum Materials. George?"

Please turn to Slide 21, where you can see the updated trailing 12 months results for EMD. Remember, this is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any corporate costs that are not business-specific.
Sales of almost $1 billion and EBITDA margins of 36% continued to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins.
As part of our preparation for the spinoff, we filed an update to our Form 10 with the SEC last week. And we provided a few slides today to help you extract the key information from the Form 10. These slides are available on our website.
Given the requirements of the Form 10, there are a few different financial bases, that I wanted to take a moment to explain. First, there are the financials you have seen reported for EMD within Air Products. Again, it's important to remember that Air Products does not allocate any nonbusiness specific corporate costs into the business segments. Second, the Form 10 includes Versum-audited combined financial statements. The most significant difference between these and the EMD financials is the allocation of Air Products' corporate costs to Versum. And finally, the Form 10 also includes Versum unaudited pro forma financial statements for FY '15 and the first half of FY '16, which includes adjustments to reflect Versum on a postseparation basis.
The 2 major areas of adjustments to point out are: a few small product lines that are currently reported in EMD, which will stay with Air Products after the spin. It's about $22 million of sales and about $11 million of profit per year. And the impact of $1.15 billion of debt, down slightly from the $1.25 billion we've talked about in the past.
We continue to believe that Versum will operate very successfully, with an initial debt ratio in the 4x -- 3x to 4x EBITDA range. We will continue to refine our thoughts on the right debt and leverage levels to support Versum's very exciting growth opportunities, as we move closer to the spin.
Now please turn to Slide 22. Given the various financials in a variety of time frames, we suggest that the most relevant cash flow numbers are shown on this slide. As referenced in the footnote, we start with $344 million of EBITDA as reported for EMD for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2016, the same $344 million you saw on the previous slide. We subtract about $20 million of EBITDA for adjustments to get to Versum standalone, including public company costs. This adjustment includes about $15 million of expected new costs and about $5 million that was previously included as a noncash depreciation charge. And then, we take out about $11 million of EBITDA, primarily for products that will stay with Air Products, resulting in a revised trailing 12 months EBITDA of $313 million. Assuming a 6% interest rate on the $1.15 billion of debt and factoring in estimated cash taxes and capital spending, you can see that Versum generates a very high level of free cash flow, about $165 million that we can use to grow our business.

Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business-specific.
Sales were down versus this year on lower LNG project activity, and profits were about flat as lower costs offset the lower sales.
As we've said, we've not seen delays or cancellations of any major equipment orders in our backlog. But the lack of customer decisions on new projects will impact our FY '16 and FY '17 results. This is likely to be about a $0.10 headwind in FY '16 versus FY '15 and will be an additional headwind for us in FY '17.

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earning per share of $1.91 to $2.01. At midpoint, this will be an increase of about 7% over fourth quarter of last year.
Our full year fiscal '16 guidance is now at $7.45 to $7.55. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 14% over our very strong fiscal year 25 [ph] performance and is $0.13 or almost 2% higher than the annual guidance we gave you in October of last year.
We now expect our CapEx to be no more than $1.2 billion for the year.
As you can see from our results, we improved our cash flow by almost $100 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating, that means we pay down debt to make sure that we have an A credit rating; number two, invest in good projects and accretive acquisitions. We are very excited about the opportunities in our core industrial gadgets business. Petrochemical investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, refinery hydrogen plants around the world and oxygen for coal gasification in China present key growth opportunities for us, and we believe Air Products is very well positioned to win profitable leads for these very large plants. And number three priority for use of cash is continuing, as we have, to increase our dividend. And number four, if there is any excess cash available, we are very comfortable in returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. At the end of the day, the cash we generate belongs to our shareholders, and we will only spend it if we have high-return projects or good acquisitions.

So that part's been very -- doing very well in line with our expectations. If you look at Process Materials, I would say two things: one, we had some discontinued operations that we exited. There's the ammonia business in China and some other smaller pieces of business, so that's a little bit of a headwind. And then the volumes, remember, we've been sort of tight on capacity on a lot of major projects -- products. We're expanding and bringing on some debottlenecking in the next few quarters. So it's just really more ups or downs of the different product lines. Overall, if you exclude discontinued business, I would say, our materials business grew in the 1.7% range."

As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY '16 full year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY '17 does not include EMD, and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business. You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior year quarter and full year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations.

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter",1106,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic 5-point plan. 
For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October. As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to note that we have been consistent. 
For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year. That's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to be become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan that we announced 2 years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this plan. The first point of plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business and then we said that we expected to complete that spin-off by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of the spin-off earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful standalone company trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the 1st of October. 
We continue to make progress on the sale of our Performance and Additives Materials to Evonik. And consistent with what we have said before, we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year. I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future, PMD employees will be called to a world-class materials company at Evonik and Versum material employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core industrial gases business, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants.
Now please turn to Slide #7, where you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our 3 key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these 3 metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.
Now please turn to Slide #8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details, but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14% and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year, enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.
On Slide #10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on stream successfully, winning new project, spinning off Versum Materials and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of the commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,403001097,1063136,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest vol",1070,"Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each, while underlying sales increased by 2%, driven by higher volumes in Gases Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia. Operating income increased 16%. Operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1% and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%.
On Slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure, more than EPS, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance in FY '16, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY '16, generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year.
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95 or 14% was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses. Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies, and cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16 and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher, primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project. Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses, as existing projects are completed, while less new projects are added to the backlog.  In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter. Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. 
We delivered significant operating leverage, again, this quarter, as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 and 260 basis points, respectively, as we continue to execute on our 5-point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%.
Now please turn to Slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talked about our focus on cash flow, so we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.17 per share or $44 million pretax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off. Also included this quarter is $14 million for position [ph] eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement cost continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable, as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest, and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02. 
And finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis, and approximately $425 million as part of the debt for debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper. This all occurred us planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of 30 September. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until the 1st of October, Air Products consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to 30 June [ph] Versum and also due to cash generation from our business, including Jazan. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."
248356,403001097,1063136,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.

Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the industrial gas business, and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals.
On Slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our 3 regional businesses in 2016: Up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stayed focused on safety and delivered the benefits from our taking the lead productivity program. 
As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan 2 years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every [ph] matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all 3 of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, U.K. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all North West England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and closed the second older liquifier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits. We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last 2 weeks.
Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our taking the lead productivity efforts across all subregions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. 
North America volumes were lowered overall -- lowered overall Americas volumes by 1% primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages. Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased.
Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year, as the benefits of taking the lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes.
And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with the Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected onstream in the fall of 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the Northern and Central regions of the United States. 
Now please turn to Slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10%, [ph] 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency. Liquid volumes were down in all 4 subregions, with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the other obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter.
Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2%, as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points. Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 20, Gases Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhanced our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits, as we have improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium, there are signs of improvement in the China LOX/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time.
Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is [ph] margin and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation. Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs.
Finally, we just announced earlier this week a new Air Separation Unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth. We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You will recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gases business that are not regional specific. Sales were up as we recognize over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognize profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch-up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017.
Now please turn to Slide 21 and I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results."

On Slide 21, you can see the Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD, continue to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins, all up versus last year.
Please turn to Slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments, and the Versum Materials team will address the results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes, driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year.
Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes, partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by Polyurethane Additives strength in spray, appliance and construction markets, as well as epoxy strength in coatings and nonresidential construction markets. Specialty Additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. 
Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but this is more than offset by lower raw material costs. EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35% and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balance. 
Finally, our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity, and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY '16. We expect a further, approximately, $0.25 headwind in FY '17 versus FY '16.

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarte",691,"Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on 2 basis. One is with our EMD business and the second is without the PMD business. As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operation. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding EMD.
You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter 1 fiscal '16 and total fiscal year '16 so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year. On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also, on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year '17, our guidance is for an earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year. 
We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisitions to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase. I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today. Therefore, it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions.
Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long term. In the last 2 years, we have delivered much more than that, and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year. And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced 2.5 years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million. And in terms of the second $300 million, we delivered over $75 million in 2016, which is twice what we had promised you before, and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost savings in addition to our debt in 2017. Again, ahead of our previous commitments.
To wrap up, please turn to Slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us, and our focus is now on profitable growth.
We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business and large projects around the world, driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements and emerging market growth.
And since we'll have significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities, while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases if the market provides a compelling opportunity.
Let me say, in closing, that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment and the hard work that they are doing every day to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results. 
And now, we will be delighted to answer any questions that you might have."

Therefore, the combination of productivity and organic growth that we see based on the plants that we see coming on stream, that is what gives us the confidence to deliver the results that we are talking about next year because that means that next year, we are not making any assumptions for any significant economic growth in the world wide. We will have a currency headwind, but we feel very good about our productivity programs. Our people did a great job in delivering the $75 million more than that last year. We are confident that we will get that.

So there remains significant overcapacity in the market and there remains probably over 5,000 to 10,000 tons of sort of capacity that's either under in construction, has been idled or people delayed startups. So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while. The positive thing for us has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business and you can see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix. All in all, I would say the pricing environment in LOX/LIN is slightly improved. You don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I just say, we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there. So all in all, though, I'd say that's positive. It's positive for us to be able to get the retail volume growth and I think that's, all in all, a very good thing for Air Products going forward.

And so, a big part of this is motivating the team and keeping ourselves focused on executing across those 10,000 things. I'd say the move towards a regional structure has dramatically improved that, including the operating control in the region and the move to an incentive plan based on that same regional structure has been a big part of those as well.

Year-on-year, that was flat for us, however, sequentially, we were up about 2%, so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat, however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington, what I talk about, but where we did shut down a liquifier and we're able to shift some load the run but also involve shutting some customers. So all in all, I think, perhaps the best indication is just the sequential moving forward, which gave us 2% and I see that as a net positive for us in I think a pretty good reflection of what's going on in North America."

They can change -- if the oil price has significantly changed, they can change their mind, they can't release those and, therefore, we cannot start working on them. So the possibility of that, I don't see being great, but it is possible, yes. But the $0.25 is real and it is based on what we have. So I'm glad you brought that up because if you take that $0.25 into account, then we are actually giving pretty good guidance in terms of growth next year.

As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY '16 full year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY '17 does not include EMD, and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business. You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior year quarter and full year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations.
Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi."

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter",1106,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focus on executing our strategic 5-point plan. 
For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October. As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to note that we have been consistent. 
For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year. That's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to be become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan that we announced 2 years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this plan. The first point of plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business and then we said that we expected to complete that spin-off by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of the spin-off earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful standalone company trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the 1st of October. 
We continue to make progress on the sale of our Performance and Additives Materials to Evonik. And consistent with what we have said before, we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year. I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future, PMD employees will be called to a world-class materials company at Evonik and Versum material employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core industrial gases business, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants.
Now please turn to Slide #7, where you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our 3 key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these 3 metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.
Now please turn to Slide #8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details, but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14% and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year, enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.
On Slide #10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on stream successfully, winning new project, spinning off Versum Materials and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of the commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"
248356,403001097,1063418,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest vol",1072,"Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each, while underlying sales increased by 2%, driven by higher volumes in Gases Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia. Operating income increased 16%. Operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1% and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%.
On Slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure, more than EPS, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance in FY '16, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY '16, generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year.
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95 or 14% was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses. Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies, and cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16 and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher, primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project. Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses, as existing projects are completed, while less new projects are added to the backlog.  In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter. Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. 
We delivered significant operating leverage, again, this quarter, as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 and 260 basis points, respectively, as we continue to execute on our 5-point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%.
Now please turn to Slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talked about our focus on cash flow, so we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.17 per share or $44 million pretax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off. Also included this quarter is $14 million for position eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement cost continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable, as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest, and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02. 
And finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis, and approximately $425 million as part of the debt for debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper. This all occurred us planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of 30 September. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until the 1st of October, Air Products consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to 30 June in part due to Versum and also due to cash generation from our business including Jazan. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the industrial gas business, and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals.
On Slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our 3 regional businesses in 2016: Up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stayed focused on safety and delivered the benefits from our taking the lead productivity program. 
As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan 2 years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every plant matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all 3 of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, U.K. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all North West England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and closed the second older liquifier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits. We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last 2 weeks.
Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our taking the lead productivity efforts across all subregions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. 
North America volumes were lowered overall -- lowered overall Americas volumes by 1% primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages. Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased.
Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year, as the benefits of taking the lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes.
And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with the Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected onstream in the fall of 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the Northern and Central regions of the United States. 
Now please turn to Slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10%, on 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency. Liquid volumes were down in all 4 subregions, with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the other obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter.
Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2%, as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points. Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 20, Gases Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhanced our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits, as we have improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium, there are signs of improvement in the China LOX/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time.
Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is at no margin and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation. Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs.
Finally, we just announced earlier this week a new Air Separation Unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth. We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You will recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gases business that are not regional specific. Sales were up as we recognize over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognize profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch-up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017.
Now please turn to Slide 21 and I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results."

On Slide 21, you can see the Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD, continue to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins, all up versus last year.
Please turn to Slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments, and the Versum Materials team will address the results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes, driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year.
Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes, partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by Polyurethane Additives strength in spray, appliance and construction markets, as well as epoxy strength in coatings and nonresidential construction markets. Specialty Additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. 
Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but this is more than offset by lower raw material costs. EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35% and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balance. 
Finally, our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity, and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY '16. We expect a further, approximately, $0.25 headwind in FY '17 versus FY '16. 
Now please turn to Slide 24, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook."

The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarte",692,"Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on 2 basis. One is with our EMD business and the second is without the PMD business. As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operation. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding EMD.
You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter 1 fiscal '16 and total fiscal year '16 so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year. On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also, on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year '17, our guidance is for an earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year. 
We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisitions to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase. I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today, therefore, it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions.
Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long term. In the last 2 years, we have delivered much more than that, and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year. And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced 2.5 years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million. And in terms of the second $300 million, we delivered over $75 million in 2016, which is twice what we had promised you before, and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost saving in addition to our debt [ph] in 2017. Again, ahead of our previous commitments.
To wrap up, please turn to Slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us and our focus is now on profitable growth.  We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business and large projects around the world, driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements and emerging market growth. And since we'll have significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases if the market provides a compelling opportunity.
Let me say, in closing, that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment and the hard work that they are doing every day to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results. 
And now we will be delighted to answer any questions that you might have."

We will have a currency headwind, but we feel very good about our productivity programs. Our people did a great job in delivering the $75 million more than that last year.

I'm not sure I'm going to go into all of our strategy and want to discuss that in a public setting, but maybe just to give you a little bit more color to it. So there remains significant overcapacity in the market and there remains probably over 5,000 to 10,000 tons of sort of capacity that's either under construction or has been idled or people have delayed startup. So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while. The positive thing for us, has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business. And you could see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix. All in all, I would say the pricing environment in LOX/LIN is slightly improved. You don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I just say, we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there. So all in all, though, I'd say that's positive. It's positive for us to be able to get the retail volume growth. And I think that's, all in all, a very good thing for Air Products going forward.

So LOX/LIN, if we were going to look at that, let's just say the most generic product goes into the most -- the largest number of industries, so it's probably the best sort of bellwether of everything. Year-on-year, that was flat for us. However, sequentially, we were up about 2%, so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat, however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington, the one I talked about where we did shutdown a liquifier and we're able to shift some load around but also involve shutting some customers. So all in all, I think -- perhaps the best indication is just the sequential moving forward, which gave us 2%, and I see that as a net positive for us in -- I think a pretty good reflection of what's going on in North America."

As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY '16 full year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY '17 does not include EMD, and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business. You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior year quarter and full year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations.

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter",1105,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic 5-point plan. 
For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October. As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to know that we have been consistent. 
For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year. That's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan that we announced 2 years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this plan. The first point of plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business and then we said that we expected to complete that spin-off by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of the spin-off earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful standalone company trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the 1st of October. 
We continue to make progress on the sale of our Performance and Additives Materials to Evonik. And consistent with what we have said before, we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year. I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future, PMD employees will be called to a world-class materials company at Evonik and Versum material employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core industrial gases business, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants.
Now please turn to Slide #7, where you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our 3 key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these 3 metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.
Now please turn to Slide #8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details, but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14% and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year, enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.
On Slide #10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on stream successfully, winning new project, spinning off Versum Materials and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of the commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 11.

I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each, while underlying sales increased by 2%, driven by higher volumes in Gases Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia. Operating income increased 16%. Operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1% and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%.
On Slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure, more than EPS, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance in FY '16, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY '16, generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year.
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95 or 14% was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses. Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies, and cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16, and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher, primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project. Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses, as existing projects are completed, while less new projects are added to the backlog.  In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter. Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. 
We delivered significant operating leverage, again, this quarter, as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 and 260 basis points, respectively, as we continue to execute on our 5-point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%.
Now please turn to Slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow, so we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.17 per share or $44 million pretax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off. Also included this quarter is $14 million for position eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable, as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest, and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02. 
And finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis, and approximately $425 million as part of the debt for debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper. This all occurred as planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of 30 September. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until the 1st of October, Air Products' consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to 30 June in part due to Versum and also due to cash generation from our business including Jazan. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the industrial gas business, and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals.
On Slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our 3 regional businesses in 2016: Up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stayed focused on safety and delivered the benefits from our Taking the Lead productivity program. 
As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan 2 years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every plant matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all 3 of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, U.K. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all northwest England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and closed a second older liquefier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits. We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last 2 weeks.
Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our Taking the Lead productivity efforts across all subregions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. 
North America volumes were lowered overall -- lowered overall Americas volumes by 1% primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages. Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased.
Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year, as the benefits of Taking the Lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes.
And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with the Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected onstream in the fall of 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the Northern and Central regions of the United States. 
Now please turn to Slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10%, on 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency. Liquid volumes were down in all 4 subregions, with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter.
Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2%, as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points. Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 20, Gases Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhanced our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits, as we have improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium, there are signs of improvement in the China LOX/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time.
Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is at no margin and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation. Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs.
Finally, we just announced earlier this week a new Air Separation Unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth. We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You will recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business that are not region- specific. Sales were up as we recognized over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognized profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch-up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017.
Now please turn to Slide 21 and I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results."

As I mentioned earlier, we completed the spin-off of our Electronics Materials business as Versum Materials on October 1, and are making progress on the sale of our Performance Materials business to Evonik.

As I mentioned earlier, we completed the spin-off of our Electronics Materials business as Versum Materials on October 1, and are making progress on the sale of our Performance Materials business to Evonik. Both of these businesses are included in Air Products continuing operations for Q4 2016.
On Slide 21, you can see the Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD, continue to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins, all up versus last year.
Please turn to Slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments, and the Versum Materials team will address their results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes, driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year.
Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes, partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by Polyurethane Additives strength in spray, appliance and construction markets, as well as epoxy strength in coatings and nonresidential construction markets. Specialty Additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. 
Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but this is more than offset by lower raw material costs. EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35% and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balance. 
Finally, our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity, and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY '16. We expect a further, approximately, $0.25 headwind in FY '17 versus FY '16. 
Now please turn to Slide 24, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook."
248356,403001097,1063731,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarte",691,"Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on 2 basis. One is with our EMD business and the second is without the PMD business. As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operation. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding PMD.
You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter 1 fiscal '16 and total fiscal year '16 so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year. On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also, on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year '17, our guidance is for an earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year. 
We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisition to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase. I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today, therefore, it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions.
Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long term. In the last 2 years, we have delivered much more than that, and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earning per share growth every year. And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced 2.5 years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million. And in terms of the second $300 million, we delivered over $75 million in 2016, which is twice what we had promised you before, and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost saving in addition to all that in 2017. Again, ahead of our previous commitments.
To wrap up, please turn to Slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us and our focus is now on profitable growth.  We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business and large projects around the world, driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements and emerging market growth. And since we'll have significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases if the market provides a compelling opportunity.
Let me say, in closing, that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment and the hard work that they are doing every day to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results. 
And now we will be delighted to answer any questions that you might have."

So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while. The positive thing for us, has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business. And you can see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix. All in all, I would say the pricing environment in LOX/LIN is slightly improved. You don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I'd just say -- we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there.

Year-on-year, that was flat for us. However, sequentially, we were up about 2%, so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat, however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington, the one I talked about, where we did shut down a liquefier and we were able to shift some load around but it also involve shedding some customers. So all in all, I think -- perhaps the best indication is just the sequential moving forward, which gave us 2%, and I see that as a net positive for us in -- I think a pretty good reflection of what's going on in North America."

As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY '16 full year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY '17 does not include EMD, and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business. You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior year quarter and full year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations.
Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi."
248356,403001097,1064582,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter",1105,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic 5-point plan. 
For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October. As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to know that we have been consistent. 
For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry.
Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year. That's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is 0 accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone.
Now please turn to Slide #4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers.
Now please turn to Slide #5. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company.
Now please turn to Slide #6, our 5-point plan that we announced 2 years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this plan. The first point of plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our Materials Technologies business and then we said that we expected to complete that spin-off by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of the spin-off earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful standalone company trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the 1st of October. 
We continue to make progress on the sale of our Performance and Additives Materials to Evonik. And consistent with what we have said before, we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year. I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the 3 companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future, PMD employees will be called to a world-class materials company at Evonik and Versum material employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long term.
We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core industrial gases business, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants.
Now please turn to Slide #7, where you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our 3 key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these 3 metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward.
Now please turn to Slide #8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details, but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14% and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year, enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds.
Now please turn to Slide #9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.
On Slide #10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on stream successfully, winning new project, spinning off Versum Materials and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of the commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contribution.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?"

I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest vol",1072,"Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 11. In summary for the year, productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each, while underlying sales increased by 2%, driven by higher volumes in Gases Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia. Operating income increased 16%. Operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1% and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%.
On Slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure, more than EPS, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance in FY '16, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY '16, generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year.
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95 or 14% was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses. Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies, and cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16, and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher, primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project. Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses, as existing projects are completed, while less new projects are added to the backlog.  In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases Asia but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter. Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. 
We delivered significant operating leverage, again, this quarter, as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 and 260 basis points, respectively, as we continue to execute on our 5-point plan. All 3 regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%.
Now please turn to Slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow, so we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.17 per share or $44 million pretax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off. Also included this quarter is $14 million for position eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release.
Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable, as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest, and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02. 
And finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis, and approximately $425 million as part of the debt for debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper. This all occurred as planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of 30 September. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until the 1st of October, Air Products' consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to 30 June in part due to Versum and also due to cash generation from our business including Jazan. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning."

Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the industrial gas business, and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals.
On Slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our 3 regional businesses in 2016: Up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stayed focused on safety and delivered the benefits from our Taking the Lead productivity program. 
As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan 2 years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every plant matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all 3 of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, U.K. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all northwest England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and closed a second older liquefier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits. We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last 2 weeks.
Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our Taking the Lead productivity efforts across all subregions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. 
North America volumes were lowered overall -- lowered overall Americas volumes by 1% primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages. Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased.
Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year, as the benefits of Taking the Lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes.
And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with the Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected onstream in the fall of 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the Northern and Central regions of the United States. 
Now please turn to Slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10%, on 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency. Liquid volumes were down in all 4 subregions, with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter.
Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2%, as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points. Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through.
Please turn to Slide 20, Gases Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhanced our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly 2/3 of the volume increase was from new plants, including an increase in energy pass-through revenue.
Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits, as we have improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium, there are signs of improvement in the China LOX/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time.
Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is at no margin and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation. Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs.
Finally, we just announced earlier this week a new Air Separation Unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth. We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record.
I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You will recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Units sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business that are not region- specific. Sales were up as we recognized over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognized profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch-up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017.
Now please turn to Slide 21 and I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results."

As I mentioned earlier, we completed the spin-off of our Electronics Materials business as Versum Materials on October 1, and are making progress on the sale of our Performance Materials business to Evonik. Both of these businesses are included in Air Products continuing operations for Q4 2016.
On Slide 21, you can see the Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD, continue to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins, all up versus last year.
Please turn to Slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments, and the Versum Materials team will address their results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes, driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year.
Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes, partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by Polyurethane Additives strength in spray, appliance and construction markets, as well as epoxy strength in coatings and nonresidential construction markets. Specialty Additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. 
Overall, prices were down given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but this is more than offset by lower raw material costs. EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35% and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points primarily driven by productivity and favorable price raw material balance. 
Finally, our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity, and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY '16. We expect a further, approximately, $0.25 headwind in FY '17 versus FY '16. 
Now please turn to Slide 24, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook."
248356,403001097,1064582,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarte",691,"Thank you, again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our 5-point strategic plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.  As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on 2 basis. One is with our EMD business and the second is without the PMD business. As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operation. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding PMD.
You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter 1 fiscal '16 and total fiscal year '16 so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year. On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also, on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year '17, our guidance is for an earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year. 
We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisition to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase. I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today, therefore, it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions.
Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long term. In the last 2 years, we have delivered much more than that, and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earning per share growth every year. And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced 2.5 years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million. And in terms of the second $300 million, we delivered over $75 million in 2016, which is twice what we had promised you before, and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost saving in addition to all that in 2017. Again, ahead of our previous commitments.
To wrap up, please turn to Slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us and our focus is now on profitable growth.  We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business and large projects around the world, driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements and emerging market growth. And since we'll have significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases if the market provides a compelling opportunity.
Let me say, in closing, that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment and the hard work that they are doing every day to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results. 
And now we will be delighted to answer any questions that you might have."

So we are prepared for competition, but we've remained very optimistic that we have an advantage and -- we have won a lot of projects.

So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while. The positive thing for us, has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business. And you can see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix. All in all, I would say the pricing environment in LOX/LIN is slightly improved. You don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I'd just say -- we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there.

And then on a quarter basis, we do the same approach, just move things sideways. We would have in the first quarter, both sequentially as well as versus prior year in Q1, about a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind, principally driven by the pound."

So LOX/LIN, if we were going to look at that, let's just say it's the most generic product, goes into the most -- the largest number of industries, so it's probably the best sort of bellwether of everything. Year-on-year, that was flat for us. However, sequentially, we were up about 2%, so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat, however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington, the one I talked about, where we did shut down a liquefier and we were able to shift some load around but it also involve shedding some customers. So all in all, I think -- perhaps the best indication is just the sequential moving forward, which gave us 2%, and I see that as a net positive for us in -- I think a pretty good reflection of what's going on in North America."

They can change -- if the oil price has significantly changed, they can change their mind, they can release those and therefore, we cannot start working on them.
