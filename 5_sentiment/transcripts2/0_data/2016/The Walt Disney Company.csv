I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of the Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%, net income was up 32% and a",1240,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of the Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%, net income was up 32% and adjusted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.63, which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. 
We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses with the incredible success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, our studio delivered $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history. Our Parks and Resorts also made history with nearly $1 billion in operating income. And our Consumer Products and interactive business set another record with $816 million NOI. Our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the company and further diversifying our future growth.
Over the last 10 years, we've built an enviable collection of vibrant, valued and admired brands. We've also created, acquired or re-envisioned several of the world's most valuable franchises and we're fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe. 
Of course, nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise, and there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products. It's been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film, The Force Awakens. Audiences and critics alike really love this movie. It's only film in history to ever reach 900 million in domestic box office. And as you may have heard, it crossed $2 billion in global box office over the weekend, more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago. 
Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning. Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded $3 billion, more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q1 of last year. Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games and EA's launch of Star Wars: Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars' history with more than 13 million units sold. 
Building of Star Wars: Episode VIII, the next chapter of the legendary saga has just commenced and will be in theaters December 2017. And production of Episode IX, the 2019 release, has also begun. In the meantime, we'll keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December. It's a compelling and original standalone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans to the Death Star that just prior to the events in the very first Star Wars movie, Episode IV, A New Hope. Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed and we absolutely love what we've seen so far. This is the first of a set of planned standalone stories and we're already in preproduction on our next one for release in May of 2018.
And on the parks from later this year, we'll break ground on spectacular new Star Wars theme land in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Clearly, Q1 saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise, as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire company for the foreseeable future. Given our unparalleled make some of the world's best IP and strongest brands, we're well-positioned for continued growth over the long term regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape.
Now turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately, ESPN and the status of the bundle. In the last couple of months, we've actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs which is encouraging. We're also pleased with what we're hearing from DISH about the response of Sling TV, a light package that includes ESPN. The service appears to be very nicely and is proving very attractive to younger consumers in particular. Significantly over indexing among millennials. And has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay-TV along with new subscribers. Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe and our networks benefit accordingly. The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages and we're currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN.
We will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market. It's interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multichannel households in 2015. Regardless in any market, we believe ESPN is well-positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons, including: the demand for sports programming especially live sports, is undiminished and consumption is at an all-time high. Last year, 95% of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports, and 81% of those viewers watch ESPN content. Across all platforms, more than 200 million adults engaged with ESPN in an average month. In other words, 4 out of 5 adults in this country connected with ESPN on some platform every month, usually more than 1. ESPN has is the sports and most people want. It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined, and it has the most important rights secured to the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports. 
Consumers, advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN. The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multichannel universe and they consistently rank ESPN as the #1 or #2 most valuable channel within it. ESPN's ad revenue continues to grow, thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most. In fact, ESPN's ad sales significantly outpaced the market, growing 3x faster than television advertising overall over the last 6 years. MVPD has just ranked ESPN #1 in perceived value for the 16th year in a row, due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market.
The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers further for the foreseeable future. The competition from new video services and products will only grow. Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing, especially among young people. And many of our brands, including Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and ESPN are tailor-made for over-the-top, direct-to-consumer app-based video products, so expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities.
Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on higher quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix, our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance. We're proud of our achievements, we're excited about the future and we're confident our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire company. 
I'm going to do the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the company, and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q1. Tom?"

As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our Media Networks business. In addition, the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us. They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high-quality content; our investment in and collaboration with Vice; our distributable agreement with AliBaba for DisneyLife in China; and ESPN's undertaking with Tencent in China as well. Our opportunistic approach also led to a successful Marvel series on Netflix, which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach. 
As importantly, after a decade of strategic value-creating acquisitions and capital allocation, our other businesses have grown significantly increasing their impact on our results. This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive long-term potential, along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth, are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago. With branded content from Disney, ESPN, ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high-impact IP in the world, and few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours.
These strategies are bearing significant fruit today continue to guide our path for the future. We've invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our Parks and Resorts business. Those efforts include: the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure; introducing MyMagic+ and doubling the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World; doubling the size of our cruise fleet; and adding 3 new lands in Hong Kong. The record results for the quarter, which include all-time high global attendance, record results for our domestic parks and our best Q1 results ever for Disney Cruise Line, reflect the impacts and value creation of these investments. 
We're already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks as well. Since December, more than 6 million guests of experience new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks. And this year, we're rolling out even more theme attractions from Parks and Resorts around the world, including Star Wars Day at Sea which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month. 
Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland, which will have its grand opening on June 16. Tickets will officially go on sale on March 28. Announcement that has been incredibly well received in China. Bob and I were over there and we couldn't be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going. Thousands of new -- have already been hired. Ride testing has started on the attractions and anticipation is palpable and growing. Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be tremendous source of pride for everyone involved. It's one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our company, which makes it a perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China, as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term.
Our franchise focused strategy is driving growth across the company, including our Consumer Products and Interactive business. Star Wars is obviously a huge driver for Consumer Products interactive results for the quarter but wasn't the only one. We're also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel led by Avengers. As we discussed previously, we have 11 franchises that generate more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales over the last 2 fiscal years, making our Consumer Products business uniquely broad and deep. 
Our positions at Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world. They also brought some of the world's most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney and marking even more creative potential across the company. 
Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films, but that's just one aspect of our incredible studios pipeline. We have 2 films from Disney feature animation this calendar year started with Disney Animation's Zootopia, an incredibly original, charming and very funny movie opening March 4t. This Thanksgiving, we'll release Moana, a comedy adventure with incredible music, very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy from Disney Animation. As you know, a sequel of Frozen is in the works. In the meantime, Disney Animation is creating the first-ever Frozen -- special which will air on ABC during the 2017 holiday season. And following the tradition of Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, we have new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in 2018.
Turning back to animation, we just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition. Pixar, and our incredibly talented colleagues there, have possibility impacted every aspect of our company and contributed mightily to our success. Looking ahead, Pixar has as strong a lineup of films as we've ever seen. Finding Dory, the long-awaited sequel to Pixar's beloved movie, Finding Nemo, opens this June. 2017 will bring us Cars 3, plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Cocoa. In 2018 comes Toy Story 4 followed by Incredibles 2 the 2019. 
From Disney live-action, this April, we'll bring Mougli, Balou and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book. Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass. And again in 2017 as Jack Sparrow for our fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 2017 will also feature Disney's live-action version of Beauty and the Beast. In addition, we have fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade. Captain America and Iron Man face off in an epic battle when Captain America: Civil War opens in May. The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet. In November, we're launching another comparing character to the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Doctor Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch.
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy return next year along with Thor: Ragnarok. And 2018, we'll release 3 more Marvel movies: Black Panther; Avengers: Infinity War; and Ant Man and the Wasp. And with more than 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe, you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue. We're excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive a continued growth and value for our company across our businesses around the world and through platforms, both old and new. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Christine to walk you for our results in more detail. Christine?"

Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comp",1006,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. It's worth noting again. Fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We delivered strong revenue growth, up 14% during the first quarter to a record $15.2 billion. Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 28% to a record $1.63. Studio Entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever, and that's following record full year results in fiscal 2015. Operating income was up 86% to over $1 billion. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter, demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window. 
The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise. Operating income at the recently combined Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media segment was up 23% and segment margins were up over 500 basis points to 45% driven by the growth in the Merchandise Licensing and games primarily on the strength of Star Wars. 
On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up an impressive 23% in the first quarter and that doesn't include the deferred revenue from Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise sold in the fourth quarter of last year. The growth in games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront, partially offset by lower Infinity results. The Disney stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise. However, the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 22% in the first quarter in reflects the favorable timing of the New Year's holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar, which we discussed in last quarter's call. We estimate this shifted about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in 2Q last year. 
Our Domestic operations had another great quarter. We continue to see strong demand from guests, specifically at our Domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our Domestic parks was up 10% in the quarter and per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our Domestic hotels was up 9% and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 92%. Our cruise business had its best Q1 ever, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending, and that's despite a 3-week dry dock of the Disney Dream. Growth in Domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris, which was closed for 4 days in November, as well as preopening spending at Shanghai.
So far this quarter, Domestic resort reservations are pacing up 2% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 4%. 
At Media Networks, operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year. However, operating income would have grown in line with 8% revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the College Football Playoff and an adverse impact from foreign exchange. Results in our cable business were lower in the first quarter as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The higher costs in Q1, which we discussed on our Q4 earnings call, were due to the timing of the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games which aired on ESPN. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Higher programming and production costs also reflects contractual rate increases for key sports rights, including the NFL and College Football, partially offset by the absence of rights costs with NASCAR.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost 25% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of the 6  ball games, as well as a strong advertising marketplace for sports in general. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue would have been up about 14% adjusted for the timing of the ball games, in the absence of NASCAR. Underlying ad trends remain very strong. However, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff, ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investments in Hulu. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 8% in the first quarter due to an increase in units sold, higher rates and shift in the timing of New Year's Eve programming to Q1, offset somewhat may lower rating. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels.
Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in rate, partially offset by roughly a 2 percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a 2 point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average, while cable affiliate revenue, adjusted for FX, was up approximately 3.5%. Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC Network and don't have any major affiliate agreement renewals in fiscal 2016. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 21.1 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased about 35.5 million shares for approximately $3.8 billion. 
Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our strategy of investing in high-quality content supported by the best brands in media continues to pay off. We are mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry and we feel we are well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape due to the strength, depth and diversity of our businesses. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A"

Obviously, we're not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products, but I think you should look at a few things. First of all, the intellectual property cycle is not only robust, but in some cases, really still growing. If you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that. But we've learned incredible pipeline, as Tom outlined earlier, at Pixar and Disney Animated Films and Disney live-action. We also know that those films drive a lot of this is across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products. So I would say that the studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the company, and that includes growth internationally because China continues to grow as a market. Consumer Products is really a great story for this quarter because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars, we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth, notably Marvel which is a great sign. We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didn't materialize. And lastly of the Parks front, we have obviously plan to build out, domestically rebuilding Avatar Land and we are building breaking ground, in fact, soon on Star Wars Land in 2 Domestic parks. And with Shanghai coming on board in June, while there are startup costs this year, you can expect that that's going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come. So we feel really good about how all 4 of our businesses are positioned. And then I think you have to also consider with the media landscape looks like, and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high-quality intellectual property, particularly branded. And there isn't a new platform that launches that is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels are to our intellectual property. And we believe that we're going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms and that will create opportunities for us to grow."

And when we acquired it in 2012 all the way up to September, we continue to see -- we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise, even though a film had not been in the marketplace since 2005. So we knew that when we brought a film out, it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise and not only did it do that, but it did well beyond what our expectations were. Don't forget, we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September 4. And the movie came out in December, so we're still seeing quite a significant tale even in this quarter from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world. And by the way, one thing that's very interesting is, that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And in fact, we saw some pretty interesting Consumer Products is even in markets where the movie didn't perform, as well as either we had hoped or, as well as other markets. So with Rogue One coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars VIII and IX planned for '17 and -- meaning, calendar year, and for '19 there's a standalone film. And then we think that -- while I don't want to predict it's going to be steady state, that we're not seen just something aberrational right now. But what we're seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales."

We believe that we benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of, particularly DISH. But I think you have to conclude that sports is very, very popular in this country. And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and then access it across platforms that access it on ESPN, it's among the most, if not the most, popular programming out there. In fact, if you look at the studies that we've done among distributors, there's #1 and #2 in terms of value creation for them for 16 straight years. If you ask consumers, they say the same thing. It's #1 or #2 in terms of them were valuable channels that they get. So I actually believe and I know you want to know about the force in terms of our agreements, but he actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous. Sports is too popular and it's not just that ESPN, just look at how the Super Bowl bid for instance, which I realize is a penultimate event. But day-after-day, week-after-weak, month-after-month, year-after-year live sports ends up being among the most highest rated programs across television. And ESPN has this incredible, as you know, an incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports, got the best venue out live sports that is out there, so we actually feel good about it. We were trying to do know is we are teaching with virtually all of the traditional platform owners and pushing ESPN into light packages and the success that DISH has experienced we think is a great selling point in that regard. At the same token, we're also looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace. We don't comment on our relationship, with a contractual relationship the distribution is but so we have not really touched on the so-called floor element of those agreements in about 15 years. And we do not foresee, by the way, that the next round of negotiations, whenever they are, are going to be particularly difficult for us because we come to the table just with ESPN along with a product that people love. And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective. ESPN's advertising ad pacing, as Christine mentioned, has been tremendous. And if you look over the last 6 years, is advertising growth is 3x the growth in television advertising. So you have a product that's great for distributors, it's great for consumers and it's great for advertisers. And I believe really -- I guess with great confidence that it's going to thrive in whatever new world media world order we're experiencing."

We fully expect that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth.

So if you look at the profile of the company interestingly enough since 2009 look at the growth profile, the company's grown on a compounded basis by 14%. The Media Networks have driven about 8% compound in the year and the rest of the company grew 23%. So 8% a year is pretty strong, 23% is extraordinary, 14% pretty damn strong, too. I think what that says is really is that over that period of time, we've actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability and that was very purposeful. These investments that we meet in Pixar, in Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that we've made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth.

So I don't really want to address the nature of the growth and other companies the mix is often different in their coming off of different basis as well. So with regard to Hulu. Look, the Hulu business model has evolved the return continues to. We noticed we have noticed they've added subscribers rather nicely. That has not been overly driven by the ad-fee portion of the equation. That's actually a small part of the subscriber base. At this point, were not overly concerned with the impact of that to the ecosystem as a whole. We'll obviously keep our eye on it. And is Bob indicated previously, he take a balanced approach to both those businesses and then also how we think about positioning our programming within them. And we'll continue to do that."

I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%. Net income was up 32% and a",1243,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%. Net income was up 32% and adjusted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.63, which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. With the incredible success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, our studio delivered $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history. Our Parks and Resorts also made history with nearly $1 billion in operating income. And our Consumer Products & Interactive business set another record with $816 million NOI. Our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the company and further diversifying our future growth.
Over the last 10 years, we've built an enviable collection of vibrant, valued and admired brands. We've also created, acquired or re-envisioned several of the world's most valuable franchises, and we're fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe.
Of course, nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise. And there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products. It's been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film, The Force Awakens. Audiences and critics alike really love this movie. It's the only film in history to ever reach 900 million in domestic box office. And as you may have heard, it crossed $2 billion in global box office over the weekend, more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago.
Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning. Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded $3 billion, more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q1 of last year. Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games. And EA's launch of Star Wars: Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars' history with more than 13 million units sold.
Building of Star Wars: Episode VIII, the next chapter of the legendary saga, has just commenced and will be in theaters December 2017. And production of Episode IX, the 2019 release, has also begun. In the meantime, we'll keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December. It's a compelling and original standalone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans to the Death Star set just prior to the events in the very first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed, and we absolutely love what we've seen so far. This is the first of a set of planned standalone stories, and we're already in preproduction on our next one for release in May of 2018.
And on the Parks front, later this year, we'll break ground on a spectacular new Star Wars theme land in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Clearly, Q1 saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire company for the foreseeable future. Given our unparalleled mix of some of the world's best IP and strongest brands, we're well positioned for continued growth over the long term regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape.
Now turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately, ESPN and the status of the bundle. In the last couple of months, we've actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs, which is encouraging. We're also pleased with what we're hearing from DISH about the response to Sling TV, a light package that includes ESPN. The service appears to be growing very nicely and is proving very attractive to young consumers in particular, significantly over-indexing among millennials and has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay-TV along with new subscribers. Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe, and our networks benefit accordingly. The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages, and we're currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN.
We will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market. It's interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multichannel households in 2015. Regardless, in any market, we believe ESPN is well positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons, including: the demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is undiminished and consumption is at an all-time high.
Last year, 95% of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports, and 81% of those viewers watched ESPN content. Across all platforms, more than 200 million adults engaged with ESPN in an average month. In other words, 4 out of 5 adults in this country connect with ESPN on some platform every month, usually more than one. ESPN has the sports that most people want. It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined, and it has the most important rights secured into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports.
Consumers, advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN. The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multichannel universe, and they consistently rank ESPN as the #1 or #2 most valuable channel within it. ESPN's ad revenue continues to grow, thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most. In fact, ESPN's ad sales significantly outpaced the market, growing 3x faster than television advertising overall over the last 6 years. MVPD has just ranked ESPN #1 in perceived value for the 16th year in a row, due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market.
The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers for the foreseeable future. The competition from new video services and products will only grow. Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing, especially among young people. And many of our brands, including Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and ESPN, are tailor-made for over-the-top, direct-to-consumer app-based video products. So expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities.
Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on high-quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix, our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance. We're proud of our achievements. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire company.
I'm going to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the company, and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q1. Tom?"

As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our Media Networks business. In addition, the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us. They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high-quality content; our investment in and collaboration with Vice; our distributable agreement with Alibaba for DisneyLife in China; and ESPN's undertaking with Tencent in China as well. Our opportunistic approach also led to a successful Marvel series on Netflix, which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach.
As importantly, after a decade of strategic value-creating acquisitions and capital allocation, our other businesses have grown significantly, increasing their impact on our results. This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive long-term potential, along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth, are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago. With branded content from Disney, ESPN, ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high-impact IP in the world. And few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours.
These strategies are bearing significant fruit today, continuing to guide our path for the future. We've invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our Parks and Resorts business. Those efforts include: the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure; introducing MyMagic+ and doubling the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World; doubling the size of our cruise fleet; and adding 3 new lands in Hong Kong. The record results for the quarter, which include all-time high global attendance, record results for our domestic parks and our best Q1 results ever for Disney Cruise Line, reflect the impacts in value creation of these investments.
We're already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks as well. Since December, more than 6 million guests have experienced new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks. And this year, we're rolling out even more theme attractions in Parks and Resorts around the world, including Star Wars Day at Sea, which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month.
Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland, which will have its grand opening on June 16. Tickets will officially go on sale on March 28, announcement that has been incredibly well received in China. Bob and I were just over there and we couldn't be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going. Thousands of new cast members have already been hired. Ride testing has started on the attractions, and the anticipation is palpable and growing. Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a tremendous source of pride for everyone involved. It's one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our company, which makes it a perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term.
Our franchise-focused strategy is driving growth across the company, including our Consumer Products & Interactive business. Star Wars is obviously a huge driver for Consumer Products & Interactive results for the quarter but wasn't the only one. We're also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel led by Avengers. As we discussed previously, we have 11 franchises that generate more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales for the last 2 fiscal years, making our Consumer Products business uniquely broad and deep.
Our positions at Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world. They also brought some of the world's most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney, unlocking even more creative potential across the company. 
Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films, but that's just one aspect of our incredible studios pipeline. We have 2 films from Disney Feature Animation this calendar year starting with Disney Animation's Zootopia, an incredibly original, charming and very funny movie opening in March 4. This Thanksgiving, we'll release Moana, a comedy adventure with incredible music, very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy from Disney Animation. As you know, a sequel of Frozen is in the works. In the meantime, Disney Animation is creating the first-ever Frozen television special, which will air on ABC during the 2017 holiday season. And following the tradition of Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, we have new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in 2018.
Turning back to animation. We just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition. Pixar, and our incredibly talented colleagues there, have possibility impacted every aspect of our company and contributed mightily to our success. Looking ahead, Pixar has as strong a lineup of films as we've ever seen. Finding Dory, the long-awaited sequel to Pixar's beloved movie, Finding Nemo, opens this June. 2017 will bring us Cars 3 plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Coco. In 2018 comes Toy Story 4 followed by Incredibles 2 in 2019. 
From Disney live-action, this April, we'll bring Mowgli, Baloo and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book. Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass and again in 2017 as Jack Sparrow for a fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 2017 will also feature Disney's live-action version of Beauty and the Beast.
In addition, we have a fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade. Captain America and Iron Man face off in an epic battle when Captain America: Civil War opens in May. The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet. In November, we're launching another compelling character to the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Doctor Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy will return next year along with Thor: Ragnarok. In 2018, we'll release 3 more Marvel movies: Black Panther; Avengers: Infinity War; and Ant-Man and the Wasp. And with more than 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe, you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue.
We're excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive continued growth and value for our company across our businesses around the world and through platforms, both old and new.
Now I'll turn the call over to Christine to walk you for our results in more detail. Christine?"

Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comp",1007,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. It's worth noting again, fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We delivered strong revenue growth, up 14% during the first quarter to a record $15.2 billion. Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 28% to a record $1.63. Studio Entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever, and that's following record full year results in fiscal 2015. Operating income was up 86% to over $1 billion. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter, demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window.
The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise. Operating income at the recently combined Disney Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment was up 23%, and segment margins were up over 500 basis points to 45%, driven by the growth in the Merchandise Licensing and Games primarily on the strength of Star Wars.
On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up an impressive 23% in the first quarter. And that doesn't include the deferred revenue from Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise sold in the fourth quarter last year. The growth in Games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront, partially offset by lower Infinity results. The Disney stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise. However, the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 22% in the first quarter and reflects the favorable timing of the New Year's holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar, which we discussed on last quarter's call. We estimate this shifted about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in 2Q last year.
Our domestic operations had another great quarter. We continue to see strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in the quarter, and per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 92%. Our cruise business had its best Q1 ever, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. And that's despite a 3-week dry dock of the Disney Dream. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris, which was closed for 4 days in November, as well as preopening spending at Shanghai.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 2% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 4%.
At Media Networks, operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year. However, operating income would have grown in line with the 8% revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the College Football Playoff and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.
Results in our Cable business were lower in the first quarter as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The higher costs in Q1, which we discussed during our Q4 earnings call, were due to the timing of the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games, which aired on ESPN. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Higher programming and production costs also reflects contractual rate increases for key sports rights, including the NFL and College Football, partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost 25% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of the 6 bowl games as well as a strong advertising marketplace for sports in general. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue would have been up about 14% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games and the absence of NASCAR. Underlying ad trends remain very strong. However, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff, ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investments in Hulu. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 8% in the first quarter due to an increase in units sold, higher rates and the shift in the timing of New Year's Eve programming to Q1, offset somewhat by lower rating. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels.
Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in rate, partially offset by roughly a 2 percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a 2 point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average, while Cable affiliate revenue, adjusted for FX, was up approximately 3.5%. Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC Network and don't have any major affiliate agreement renewals in fiscal 2016.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 21.1 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased about 35.5 million shares for approximately $3.8 billion.
Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our strategy of investing in high-quality content supported by the best brands in media continues to pay off. We are mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry, and we feel we are well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape due to the strength, depth and diversity of our businesses.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

Obviously, we're not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products, but I think you should look at a few things. First of all, the intellectual property cycle is not only robust, but in some cases, really still growing, if you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that. But we've got an incredible pipeline, as Tom outlined earlier, at Pixar and Disney Animated Films and Disney live-action. We also know that those films drive a lot of business across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products. So I would say that the Studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the company, and that includes growth internationally because China continues to grow as a market. Consumer Products is really a great story for this quarter because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars, we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth, notably Marvel, which is a great sign. We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didn't materialize. And lastly on the Parks front, we have obviously plans to build out. Domestically, we're building Avatar Land and we're building -- breaking ground, in fact, soon on Star Wars Land in the 2 domestic parks. And with Shanghai coming on board in June, while there are startup costs this year, you can expect that, that's going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come. So we feel really good about how all 4 of our businesses are positioned. And then I think you have to also consider what the media landscape looks like, and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high-quality intellectual property, particularly branded. And there isn't a new platform that launches that is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels or to our intellectual property. And we believe that we're going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms, and that will create opportunities for us to grow."

Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, reducing the loss of subs by some 2 million subscribers -- or 2 million households, I should say, that we concluded that at that point, our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched."

And when we acquired it in 2012 all the way up to September, we continue to see -- we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise even though a film had not been in the marketplace since 2005. So we knew that when we brought a film out, it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise. And not only did it do that, but it did well beyond what our expectations were. Don't forget, we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September 4, and the movie came out in December. So we're still seeing quite a significant tale even in this quarter from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world. And by the way, one thing that's very interesting is that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And in fact, we saw some pretty interesting Consumer Products sale even in markets where the movie didn't perform as well as either we had hoped or as well as other markets. So with Rogue One coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars VIII and IX planned for '17 and -- meaning calendar year, and for '19, there's another standalone film, we think that -- while I don't want to predict it's going to be steady state, that we're not seeing just something aberrational right now. But what we're seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales."

We believe that we benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of, particularly DISH. But I think you have to conclude that sports is very, very popular in this country. And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and then access it -- across platforms rather, then access it on ESPN, it's among the most, if not the most, popular programming out there. In fact, if you look at the studies that we've done among distributors, there's #1 and #2 in terms of value creation for them for 16 straight years. If you ask consumers, they say the same thing. It's #1 or #2 in terms of the most valuable channels that they get. So I actually believe -- and I know you want to know about the floors in terms of our agreements, but I actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous. Sports is too popular. And it's not just at ESPN. Just look at how the Super Bowl did, for instance, which I realize is a penultimate event. But day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month, year-after-year, live sports ends up being among the most highest-rated programs across television. And ESPN has this incredible, as you know, incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports, got the best venue of live sports that is out there. So we actually feel good about it. What we're trying to do now is we're engaging with virtually all of the traditional platform owners and pushing ESPN into light packages, and the success that DISH has experienced, we think, is a great selling point in that regard. At the same token, we're also looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace. We don't comment on our relationship or a contractual relationship with the distributors, but it's safe to assume we have not really touched the so-called floor element of those agreements in about 15 years. And we do not foresee, by the way, that the next round of negotiations, whenever they are, are going to be particularly difficult for us because we come to the table just with ESPN alone with a product that people love. And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective. ESPN's ad pacing, as Christine mentioned, has been tremendous. And if you look over the last 6 years, its advertising growth is 3x the growth of television advertising. So you have a product that's great for distributors, it's great for consumers and it's great for advertisers. And I believe really, I guess, with great confidence that it's going to thrive in whatever new world media world order we're experiencing."

We fully expect that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth. We also are designed as a company to leverage intellectual property across a lot of our businesses or to leverage the collection of brands nicely in the marketplace.

So if you look at the profile of the company, interestingly enough since 2009, look at the growth profile, the company's grown on a compounded basis by 14%. The Media Networks have driven about 8% compounded a year, and the rest of the company grew 23%. So 8% a year is pretty strong; 23% is extraordinary; 14%, pretty damn strong, too. I think what that says is really is that over that period of time, we've actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability. And that was very purposeful. These investments that we made in Pixar, in Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that we've made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth. And that was not just across businesses but really across the world because a lot of these businesses are global in nature unlike some of our media assets."

When I look at the buybacks, I think it was a record dollar amount last quarter and second highest the quarter you just printed. Should investors view that decision to buy back as much stock as you are a function of what you think the intrinsic value of your equity is relative to what it's trading at? Or is it more a function of the very lean balance sheet and the lack of M&A opportunities, i.e., other better uses for your cash?"

And some, like the Studio, are somewhat lumpy in nature, meaning there are good years and there are bad based on the slate. I'm not suggesting that every year we grow because there will be ups and downs in some cases, but they will be much flatter in nature, meaning you can expect that the bottom line contribution from the businesses will continue on essentially on a more consistent basis than they were -- than what you saw in the past."

Most of your peers that have television stations have growth significantly above that in their retransmission fees.

So I don't really want to address the nature of the growth at other companies. The mix is often different and they're coming off of different bases as well. So with regard to Hulu, look, the Hulu business model has evolved over time. It continues to. We've noticed that they have added subscribers rather nicely. That has not been overly driven by the ad free portion of the equation. That's actually a small part of the subscriber base. And at this point, we're not overly concerned with the impact of that to the ecosystem as a whole. We'll obviously keep our eye on it. And as Bob has indicated previously, we take a balanced approach to both those businesses and then also how we think about positioning our programming within them. And we'll continue to do that."

Net income was up 32% and a",1244,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%. Net income was up 32% and adjusted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.63, which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. With the incredible success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, our studio delivered $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history. Our Parks and Resorts also made history with nearly $1 billion in operating income. And our Consumer Products & Interactive business set another record with $860 million NOI. Our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the company and further diversifying our future growth.
Over the last 10 years, we've built an enviable collection of vibrant, valued and admired brands. We've also created, acquired or re-envisioned several of the world's most valuable franchises, and we're fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe.
Of course, nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise. And there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products. It's been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film, The Force Awakens. Audiences and critics alike really love this movie. It's the only film in history to ever reach $900 million in domestic box office. And as you may have heard, it crossed $2 billion in global box office over the weekend, more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago.
Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning. Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded $3 billion, more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q1 of last year. Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games. And EA's launch of Star Wars: Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars' history with more than 13 million units sold.
Building of Star Wars: Episode VIII, the next chapter of the legendary saga, has just commenced and will be in theaters December 2017. And production of Episode IX, a 2019 release, has also begun. In the meantime, we'll keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December. It's a compelling and original standalone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans to the Death Star set just prior to the events in the very first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed, and we absolutely love what we've seen so far. This is the first of a set of planned standalone stories, and we're already in preproduction on our next one for release in May of 2018.
And on the Parks front, later this year, we'll break ground on a spectacular new Star Wars theme land in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Clearly, Q1 saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire company for the foreseeable future. Given our unparalleled mix of some of the world's best IP and strongest brands, we're well positioned for continued growth over the long term regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape.
Now turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately, ESPN and the status of the bundle. In the last couple of months, we've actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs, which is encouraging. We're also pleased with what we're hearing from DISH about the response to Sling TV, a light package that includes ESPN. The service appears to be growing nicely and is proving very attractive to young consumers in particular, significantly over-indexing among millennials and has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay-TV along with new subscribers. Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe, and our networks benefit accordingly. The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages, and we're currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN.
We will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market. It's interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multichannel households in 2015. Regardless, in any market, we believe ESPN is well positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons, including: 
[Audio Gap]
The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is undiminished and consumption is at an all-time high.
Last year, 95% of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports, and 81% of those viewers watched ESPN content. Across all platforms, more than 200 million adults engaged with ESPN in an average month. In other words, 4 out of 5 adults in this country connect with ESPN on some platform every month, usually more than one. ESPN has the sports that most people want. It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined, and it has the most important rights secured into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports.
Consumers, advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN. The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multichannel universe, and they consistently rank ESPN as the #1 or #2 most valuable channel within it. ESPN's ad revenue continues to grow, thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most. In fact, ESPN's ad sales significantly outpace the market, growing 3x faster than television advertising overall over the last 6 years. MVPD has just ranked ESPN #1 in perceived value for the 16th year in a row, due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market.
The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers for the foreseeable future. The competition from new video services and products will only grow. Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing, especially among young people. And many of our brands, including Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and ESPN, are tailor-made for over-the-top, direct-to-consumer app-based video products. So expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities.
Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on high-quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix, our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance. We're proud of our achievements. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire company.
I'm going to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the company, and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q1. Tom?"

As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our Media Networks business. In addition, the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us. They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high-quality content; our investment in and collaboration with Vice; our distribution agreement with Alibaba for DisneyLife in China; and ESPN's undertaking with Tencent in China as well. Our opportunistic approach also led to our successful Marvel series on Netflix, which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach.
As importantly, after a decade of strategic value-creating acquisitions and capital allocation, our other businesses have grown significantly, increasing their impact on our results. This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive long-term potential, along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth, are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago. With branded content from Disney, ESPN, ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high-impact IP in the world. And few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours.
These strategies are bearing significant fruit today, and continue to guide our path for the future. We've invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our Parks and Resorts business. Those efforts include: the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure; introducing MyMagic+ and doubling the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World; doubling the size of our cruise fleet; and adding 3 new lands in Hong Kong. The record results for the quarter, which include all-time high global attendance, record results for our domestic parks and our best Q1 results ever for Disney Cruise Line, reflect the impacts in value creation of these investments.
We're already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks as well. Since December, more than 6 million guests have experienced new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks. And this year, we're rolling out even more theme attractions in Parks and Resorts around the world, including Star Wars Day at Sea, which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month.
Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland, which will have its grand opening on June 16. Tickets will officially go on sale on March 28, announcement that has been incredibly well received in China. Bob and I were just over there and we couldn't be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going. Thousands of new cast members have already been hired. Ride testing has started on the attractions, and the anticipation is palpable and growing. Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a tremendous source of pride for everyone involved. It's one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our company, which makes it a perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term.
Our franchise-focused strategy is driving growth across the company, including our Consumer Products & Interactive business. Star Wars is obviously a huge driver for Consumer Products & Interactive results for the quarter but it wasn't the only one. We're also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel led by Avengers. As we've discussed previously, we have 11 franchises that generated more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales for the last 2 fiscal years, making our Consumer Products business uniquely broad and deep.
Our positions at Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world. They also brought some of the world's most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney, unlocking even more creative potential across the company. 
Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films, but that's just one aspect of our incredible studios pipeline. We have 2 films from Disney Feature Animation this calendar year starting with Disney Animation's Zootopia, an incredibly original, charming and very funny movie opening March 4. This Thanksgiving, we'll release Moana, a comedy adventure with incredible music, very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy from Disney Animation. As you know, a sequel of Frozen is in the works. In the meantime, Disney Animation is creating the first-ever Frozen television special, which will air on ABC during the 2017 holiday season. And following the tradition of Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, we have new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in 2018.
Turning back to animation. We just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition. Pixar, and our incredibly talented colleagues there, have positively impacted every aspect of our company and contributed mightily to our success. Looking ahead, Pixar has as strong a lineup of films as we've ever seen. Finding Dory, the long-awaited sequel to Pixar's beloved movie, Finding Nemo, opens this June. 2017 will bring us Cars 3 plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Coco. In 2018 comes Toy Story 4 followed by Incredibles 2 in 2019. 
From Disney live-action, this April, we'll bring Mowgli, Baloo and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book. Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass and again in 2017 as Jack Sparrow for a fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 2017 will also feature Disney's live-action version of Beauty and the Beast.
In addition, we have a fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade. Captain America and Iron Man face off in an epic battle when Captain America: Civil War opens in May. The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet. In November, we're launching another compelling character into the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Doctor Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy will return next year along with Thor: Ragnarok. In 2018, we'll release 3 more Marvel movies: Black Panther; Avengers: Infinity War; and Ant-Man and the Wasp. And with more than 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe, you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue.
We're excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive continued growth and value for our company across our businesses around the world and through platforms, both old and new.
Now I'll turn the call over to Christine to walk you through our results in more detail. Christine?"

We delivered strong revenue growth, up 14% during the first quarter to a record $15.2 billion. Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 28% to a record $1.63. Studio Entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever, and that's following record full year results in fiscal 2015. Operating income was up 86% to over $1 billion. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter, demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window.
The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise. Operating income at the recently combined Disney Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment was up 23%, and segment margins were up over 500 basis points to 45%, driven by the growth in Merchandise Licensing and Games primarily on the strength of Star Wars.
On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up an impressive 23% in the first quarter. And that doesn't include the deferred revenue from Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise sold in the fourth quarter last year. The growth in Games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront, partially offset by lower Infinity results. The Disney stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise. However, the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 22% in the first quarter and reflects the favorable timing of the New Year's holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar, which we discussed on last quarter's call. We estimate this shifted about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in 2Q last year.
Our domestic operations had another great quarter. We continue to see strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in the quarter, and per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 92%. Our cruise business had its best Q1 ever, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. And that's despite a 3-week dry dock of the Disney Dream. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris, which was closed for 4 days in November, as well as preopening spending at Shanghai.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 2% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 4%.
At Media Networks, operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year. However, operating income would have grown in line with the 8% revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the College Football Playoff and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.
Results in our Cable business were lower in the first quarter as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The higher costs in Q1, which we discussed during our Q4 earnings call, were due to the timing of the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games, which aired on ESPN. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Higher programming and production costs also reflects contractual rate increases for key sports rights, including the NFL and College Football, partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost 25% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of the 6 bowl games as well as a strong advertising marketplace for sports in general. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue would have been up about 14% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games and the absence of NASCAR. Underlying ad trends remain very strong. However, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff, ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investment in Hulu. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 8% in the first quarter due to an increase in units sold, higher rates and a shift in the timing of New Year's Eve programming to Q1, offset somewhat by lower ratings. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels.
Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in rate, partially offset by roughly a 2 percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a 2 point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average, while Cable affiliate revenue, adjusted for FX, was up approximately 3.5%. Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC Network and don't have any major affiliate agreement renewals in fiscal 2016.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 21.1 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased about 35.5 million shares for approximately $3.8 billion.
Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our strategy of investing in high-quality content supported by the best brands in media continues to pay off. We are mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry, and we feel we are well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape due to the strength, depth and diversity of our businesses.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

Obviously, we're not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products, but I think you should look at a few things. First of all, the intellectual property cycle is not only robust, but in some cases, really still growing, if you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that. But we've got an incredible pipeline, as Tom outlined earlier, of Pixar and Disney Animated Films and Disney live-action. We also know that those films drive a lot of business across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products. So I would say that the Studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the company, and that includes growth internationally because China continues to grow as a market. Consumer Products is really a great story for this quarter because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars, we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth, notably Marvel, which is a great sign. We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didn't materialize. And lastly on the Parks front, we have obviously plans to build out. Domestically, we're building Avatar Land and we're building -- breaking ground, in fact, soon on Star Wars Land in the 2 domestic parks. And with Shanghai coming on board in June, while there are startup costs this year, you can expect that, that's going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come. So we feel really good about how all 4 of our businesses are positioned. And then I think you have to also consider what the media landscape looks like, and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high-quality intellectual property, particularly branded. And there isn't a new platform that launches that is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels or to our intellectual property. And we believe that we're going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms, and that will create opportunities for us to grow."

At the time that I made the comments last August, we were seeing some sub erosion from both sides, from skinny bundles and from essentially a decrease in the total number of subs. At the time, because of where -- what Nielsen was telling us, we concluded that most of it was coming from simple loss of subs. Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, reducing the loss of subs by some 2 million subscribers -- or 2 million households, I should say, that we concluded that at that point, our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched."

And when we acquired it in 2012 all the way up to September, we continued to see -- we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise even though a film had not been in the marketplace since 2005. So we knew that when we brought a film out, it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise. And not only did it do that, but it did it well beyond what our expectations were. Don't forget, we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September 4, and the movie came out in December. So we're still seeing quite a significant tail even in this quarter from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world. And by the way, one thing that's very interesting is that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And in fact, we saw some pretty interesting Consumer Products sales even in markets where the movie didn't perform as well as either we had hoped or as well as other markets. So with Rogue One coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars VIII and IX planned for '17 and -- meaning calendar year, and for '19, and another standalone film, we think that -- while I don't want to predict it's going to be steady state, that we're not seeing just something aberrational right now. But what we're seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales."

We believe that we benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of, particularly DISH. But I think you have to conclude that sports is very, very popular in this country. And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and then access it -- across platforms rather, then access it on ESPN, it's among the most, if not the most, popular programming out there. In fact, if you look at the studies that we've done among distributors, there's #1 and #2 in terms of value creation for them for 16 straight years. If you ask consumers, they say the same thing. It's #1 or #2 in terms of the most valuable channels that they get. So I actually believe -- and I know you want to know about the floors in terms of our agreements, but I actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous. Sports is too popular. And it's not just at ESPN. Just look at how the Super Bowl did, as a for instance, which I realize is a penultimate event. But day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month, year-after-year, live sports ends up being among the highest-rated programs across television. And ESPN has this incredible, as you know, incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports, got the best venue of live sports that is out there. So we actually feel good about it. What we're trying to do now is we're engaging with virtually all of the traditional platform owners and pushing ESPN into light packages, and the success that DISH has experienced, we think, is a great selling point in that regard. At the same token, we're also looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace. We don't comment on our relationship or a contractual relationship with the distributors, but it's safe to assume we have not really touched the so-called floor element of those agreements in about 15 years. And we do not foresee, by the way, that the next round of negotiations, whenever they are, are going to be particularly difficult for us because we come to the table just with ESPN alone with a product that people love. And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective. ESPN's ad pacing, as Christine mentioned, has been tremendous. And if you look over the last 6 years, its advertising growth is 3x the growth of television advertising. So you have a product that's great for distributors, it's great for consumers and it's great for advertisers. And I believe really, I guess, with great confidence that it's going to thrive in whatever new media world order we're experiencing."

And then related, Bob, I'm just trying to square the subscriber growth comment with the subscriber headwinds in the Q. I think part of this may be we're talking Nielsen and then paid subs. But are you saying you expect the subscriber headwinds to abate as you move through the next few quarters? Is that what you're saying or am I reading too much into that?"

We fully expect that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth. We also are designed as a company to leverage intellectual property across a lot of our businesses or to leverage the collection of brands nicely in the marketplace. And that also is reflected in the way we operate the businesses from an expense perspective with consolidation in many different areas. So if you look at the profile of the company, interestingly enough since 2009, look at the growth profile, the company's grown on a compounded basis by 14%. The Media Networks have driven about 8% compounded a year, and the rest of the company grew 23%. So 8% a year is pretty strong; 23% is extraordinary; 14%, pretty damn strong, too. I think what that says is really is that over that period of time, we've actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability. And that was very purposeful. These investments that we made in Pixar, in Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that we've made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth. And that was not just across businesses but really across the world because a lot of these businesses are global in nature unlike some of our media assets."

So I don't really want to address the nature of the growth at other companies. The mix is often different and they're coming off of different bases as well. So with regard to Hulu, look, the Hulu business model has evolved over time. It continues to. We've noticed that they have added subscribers rather nicely. That has not been overly driven by the ad free portion of the equation. That's actually a small part of the subscriber base. And at this point, we're not overly concerned with the impact of that to the ecosystem as a whole. We'll obviously keep our eye on it.

Net income was up 32% and a",1244,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to fiscal 2016. Revenue was up 14%. Net income was up 32% and adjusted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.63, which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.
We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. With the incredible success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, our studio delivered $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history. Our Parks and Resorts also made history with nearly $1 billion in operating income. And our Consumer Products & Interactive business set another record with $860 million NOI. Our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the company and further diversifying our future growth.
Over the last 10 years, we've built an enviable collection of vibrant, valued and admired brands. We've also created, acquired or re-envisioned several of the world's most valuable franchises, and we're fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe.
Of course, nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise. And there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products. It's been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film, The Force Awakens. Audiences and critics alike really love this movie. It's the only film in history to ever reach $900 million in domestic box office. And as you may have heard, it crossed $2 billion in global box office over the weekend, more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago.
Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning. Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded $3 billion, more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q1 of last year. Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games. And EA's launch of Star Wars: Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars' history with more than 13 million units sold.
Filming of Star Wars: Episode VIII, the next chapter of the legendary saga, has just commenced and will be in theaters December 2017. And production of Episode IX, a 2019 release, has also begun. In the meantime, we'll keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December. It's a compelling and original standalone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans to the Death Star set just prior to the events in the very first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed, and we absolutely love what we've seen so far. This is the first of a set of planned standalone stories, and we're already in preproduction on our next one for release in May of 2018.
And on the Parks front, later this year, we'll break ground on a spectacular new Star Wars theme land in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Clearly, Q1 saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire company for the foreseeable future. Given our unparalleled mix of some of the world's best IP and strongest brands, we're well positioned for continued growth over the long term regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape.
Now turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately, ESPN and the status of the bundle. In the last couple of months, we've actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs, which is encouraging. We're also pleased with what we're hearing from DISH about the response to Sling TV, a light package that includes ESPN. The service appears to be growing nicely and is proving very attractive to young consumers in particular, significantly over-indexing among millennials and has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay-TV along with new subscribers. Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe, and our networks benefit accordingly. The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages, and we're currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN.
We will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market. It's interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multichannel households in 2015. Regardless, in any market, we believe ESPN is well positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons, including: 
[Audio Gap]
The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is undiminished and consumption is at an all-time high.
Last year, 95% of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports, and 81% of those viewers watched ESPN content. Across all platforms, more than 200 million adults engaged with ESPN in an average month. In other words, 4 out of 5 adults in this country connect with ESPN on some platform every month, usually more than one. ESPN has the sports that most people want. It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined, and it has the most important rights secured into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports.
Consumers, advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN. The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multichannel universe, and they consistently rank ESPN as the #1 or #2 most valuable channel within it. ESPN's ad revenue continues to grow, thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most. In fact, ESPN's ad sales significantly outpace the market, growing 3x faster than television advertising overall over the last 6 years. MVPD has just ranked ESPN #1 in perceived value for the 16th year in a row, due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market.
The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers for the foreseeable future. The competition from new video services and products will only grow. Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing, especially among young people. And many of our brands, including Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and ESPN, are tailor-made for over-the-top, direct-to-consumer app-based video products. So expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities.
Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on high-quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix, our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance. We're proud of our achievements. We're excited about the future, and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire company.
I'm going to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the company, and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q1. Tom?"
191564,321233850,934081,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Hello, everyone. As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our Media Networks business.

As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our Media Networks business. In addition, the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us. They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high-quality content; our investment in and collaboration with Vice; our distribution agreement with Alibaba for DisneyLife in China; and ESPN's undertaking with Tencent in China as well. Our opportunistic approach also led to our successful Marvel series on Netflix, which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach.
As importantly, after a decade of strategic value-creating acquisitions and capital allocation, our other businesses have grown significantly, increasing their impact on our results. This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive long-term potential, along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth, are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago. With branded content from Disney, ESPN, ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high-impact IP in the world. And few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours.
These strategies are bearing significant fruit today, and continue to guide our path for the future. We've invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our Parks and Resorts business. Those efforts include: the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure; introducing MyMagic+ and doubling the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World; doubling the size of our cruise fleet; and adding 3 new lands in Hong Kong. The record results for the quarter, which include all-time high global attendance, record results for our domestic parks and our best Q1 results ever for Disney Cruise Line, reflect the impacts in value creation of these investments.
We're already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks as well. Since December, more than 6 million guests have experienced new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks. And this year, we're rolling out even more theme attractions in Parks and Resorts around the world, including Star Wars Day at Sea, which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month.
Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland, which will have its grand opening on June 16. Tickets will officially go on sale on March 28, announcement that has been incredibly well received in China. Bob and I were just over there and we couldn't be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going. Thousands of new cast members have already been hired. Ride testing has started on the attractions, and the anticipation is palpable and growing. Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a tremendous source of pride for everyone involved. It's one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our company, which makes it a perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term.
Our franchise-focused strategy is driving growth across the company, including our Consumer Products & Interactive business. Star Wars is obviously a huge driver for Consumer Products & Interactive results for the quarter but it wasn't the only one. We're also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel led by Avengers. As we've discussed previously, we have 11 franchises that generated more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales for the last 2 fiscal years, making our Consumer Products business uniquely broad and deep.
Our acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world. They also brought some of the world's most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney, unlocking even more creative potential across the company. 
Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films, but that's just one aspect of our incredible studios pipeline. We have 2 films from Disney Feature Animation this calendar year starting with Disney Animation's Zootopia, an incredibly original, charming and very funny movie opening March 4. This Thanksgiving, we'll release Moana, a comedy adventure with incredible music, very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy of Disney Animation. As you know, a sequel of Frozen is in the works. In the meantime, Disney Animation is creating the first-ever Frozen television special, which will air on ABC during the 2017 holiday season. And following the tradition of Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, we have new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in 2018.
Turning back to animation. We just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition. Pixar, and our incredibly talented colleagues there, have positively impacted every aspect of our company and contributed mightily to our success. Looking ahead, Pixar has as strong a lineup of films as we've ever seen. Finding Dory, the long-awaited sequel to Pixar's beloved movie, Finding Nemo, opens this June. 2017 will bring us Cars 3 plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Coco. In 2018 comes Toy Story 4 followed by Incredibles 2 in 2019. 
From Disney live-action, this April, we'll bring Mowgli, Baloo and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book. Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass and again in 2017 as Jack Sparrow for a fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 2017 will also feature Disney's live-action version of Beauty and the Beast.
In addition, we have a fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade. Captain America and Iron Man face off in an epic battle when Captain America: Civil War opens in May. The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet. In November, we're launching another compelling character into the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Doctor Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy will return next year along with Thor: Ragnarok. In 2018, we'll release 3 more Marvel movies: Black Panther; Avengers: Infinity War; and Ant-Man and the Wasp. And with more than 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe, you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue.
We're excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive continued growth and value for our company across our businesses around the world and through platforms, both old and new.
Now I'll turn the call over to Christine to walk you through our results in more detail. Christine?"

Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comp",1006,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. It's worth noting again, fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We delivered strong revenue growth, up 14% during the first quarter to a record $15.2 billion. Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 28% to a record $1.63. Studio Entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever, and that's following record full year results in fiscal 2015. Operating income was up 86% to over $1 billion. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter, demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window.
The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise. Operating income at the recently combined Disney Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment was up 23%, and segment margins were up over 500 basis points to 45%, driven by the growth in Merchandise Licensing and Games primarily on the strength of Star Wars.
On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up an impressive 23% in the first quarter. And that doesn't include the deferred revenue from Star Wars: Episode VII merchandise sold in the fourth quarter last year. The growth in Games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront, partially offset by lower Infinity results. The Disney stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise. However, the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year.
At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 22% in the first quarter and reflects the favorable timing of the New Year's holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar, which we discussed on last quarter's call. We estimate this shifted about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in 2Q last year.
Our domestic operations had another great quarter. We continue to see strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in the quarter, and per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 92%. Our cruise business had its best Q1 ever, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. And that's despite a 3-week dry dock of the Disney Dream. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris, which was closed for 4 days in November, as well as preopening spending at Shanghai.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 2% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 4%.
At Media Networks, operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year. However, operating income would have grown in line with the 8% revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the College Football Playoff and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.
Results in our Cable business were lower in the first quarter as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The higher costs in Q1, which we discussed during our Q4 earnings call, were due to the timing of the 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl game, including the 2 semifinal games, which aired on ESPN. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Higher programming and production costs also reflects contractual rate increases for key sports rights, including the NFL and College Football, partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost 25% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of the 6 bowl games as well as a strong advertising marketplace for sports in general. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue would have been up about 14% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games and the absence of NASCAR. Underlying ad trends remain very strong. However, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff, ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investment in Hulu. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 8% in the first quarter due to an increase in units sold, higher rates and a shift in the timing of New Year's Eve programming to Q1, offset somewhat by lower ratings. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels.
Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in rate, partially offset by roughly a 2 percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a 2 point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average, while Cable affiliate revenue, adjusted for FX, was up approximately 3.5%. Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC Network and don't have any major affiliate agreement renewals in fiscal 2016.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 21.1 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased about 35.5 million shares for approximately $3.8 billion.
Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our strategy of investing in high-quality content supported by the best brands in media continues to pay off. We are mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry, and we feel we are well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape due to the strength, depth and diversity of our businesses.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

Obviously, we're not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products, but I think you should look at a few things. First of all, the intellectual property cycle is not only robust, but in some cases, really still growing, if you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that. But we've got an incredible pipeline, as Tom outlined earlier, of Pixar and Disney Animated Films and Disney live-action. We also know that those films drive a lot of business across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products. So I would say that the Studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the company, and that includes growth internationally because China continues to grow as a market. Consumer Products is really a great story for this quarter because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars, we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth, notably Marvel, which is a great sign. We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didn't materialize. And lastly on the Parks front, we have obviously plans to build out. Domestically, we're building Avatar Land and we're building -- breaking ground, in fact, soon on Star Wars Land in the 2 domestic parks. And with Shanghai coming on board in June, while there are startup costs this year, you can expect that, that's going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come. So we feel really good about how all 4 of our businesses are positioned. And then I think you have to also consider what the media landscape looks like, and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high-quality intellectual property, particularly branded. And there isn't a new platform that launches that is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels or to our intellectual property. And we believe that we're going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms, and that will create opportunities for us to grow."

And when we acquired it in 2012 all the way up to September, we continued to see -- we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise even though a film had not been in the marketplace since 2005. So we knew that when we brought a film out, it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise. And not only did it do that, but it did it well beyond what our expectations were. Don't forget, we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September 4, and the movie came out in December. So we're still seeing quite a significant tail even in this quarter from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world. And by the way, one thing that's very interesting is that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And in fact, we saw some pretty interesting Consumer Products sales even in markets where the movie didn't perform as well as either we had hoped or as well as other markets. So with Rogue One coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars VIII and IX planned for '17 and -- meaning calendar year, and for '19, and another standalone film, we think that -- while I don't want to predict it's going to be steady state, that we're not seeing just something aberrational right now. But what we're seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales."

We believe that we benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of, particularly DISH. But I think you have to conclude that sports is very, very popular in this country. And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and then access it -- across platforms rather, then access it on ESPN, it's among the most, if not the most, popular programming out there. In fact, if you look at the studies that we've done among distributors, there's #1 and #2 in terms of value creation for them for 16 straight years. If you ask consumers, they say the same thing. It's #1 or #2 in terms of the most valuable channels that they get. So I actually believe -- and I know you want to know about the floors in terms of our agreements, but I actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous. Sports is too popular. And it's not just at ESPN. Just look at how the Super Bowl did, as a for instance, which I realize is a penultimate event. But day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month, year-after-year, live sports ends up being among the highest-rated programs across television. And ESPN has this incredible, as you know, incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports, got the best venue of live sports that is out there. So we actually feel good about it. What we're trying to do now is we're engaging with virtually all of the traditional platform owners in pushing ESPN into light packages, and the success that DISH has experienced, we think, is a great selling point in that regard. At the same token, we're also looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace. We don't comment on our relationship or a contractual relationship with the distributors, but it's safe to assume we have not really touched the so-called floor element of those agreements in about 15 years. And we do not foresee, by the way, that the next round of negotiations, whenever they are, are going to be particularly difficult for us because we come to the table just with ESPN alone with a product that people love. And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective. ESPN's ad pacing, as Christine mentioned, has been tremendous. And if you look over the last 6 years, its advertising growth is 3x the growth of television advertising. So you have a product that's great for distributors, it's great for consumers and it's great for advertisers. And I believe really, I guess, with great confidence that it's going to thrive in whatever new media world order we're experiencing."

We fully expect that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth. We also are designed as a company to leverage intellectual property across a lot of our businesses or to leverage the collection of brands nicely in the marketplace. And that also is reflected in the way we operate the businesses from an expense perspective with consolidation in many different areas. So if you look at the profile of the company, interestingly enough since 2009, look at the growth profile, the company's grown on a compounded basis by 14%. The Media Networks have driven about 8% compounded a year, and the rest of the company grew 23%. So 8% a year is pretty strong; 23% is extraordinary; 14%, pretty damn strong, too. I think what that says is really is that over that period of time, we've actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability. And that was very purposeful. These investments that we made in Pixar, in Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that we've made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth. And that was not just across businesses but really across the world because a lot of these businesses are global in nature unlike some of our media assets."

The only other thing to keep in mind is that as new sports contracts kick in next year as an example, that will sometimes cause a shift in terms of how the growth is coming, but the overall growth story is intact. So I think that gives you what color is available there."

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.",1255,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our financial results this quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, demonstrate once again how the strength of our brands and a relentless focus on creative excellence and execution can continue to drive growth across our businesses and create value for our shareholders. 
Our Studio delivered another great quarter with operating income up 27% versus last year. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the worldwide theatrical success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Disney Animation's Zootopia. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for the Studio, and the first half of fiscal 2016 is off to a record start with over $1.5 billion in operating income due to the phenomenal performance of our film slate. Fiscal year-to-date, Star Wars: The Force Awakens has generated almost $2.1 billion in global box office. Zootopia has generated $960 million, making it the #1 film of the year so far and the second highest grossing Disney Animation Studio film behind Frozen. I'll also note that Zootopia is the #1 animated film of all time in China, grossing over $235 million today. 
The success of our Studio is no accident. It is the result of our strategy of making high-quality branded films and leveraging that success across a number of our integrated businesses. No company does a better job than Disney in creating, cultivating and extending the value of our franchise. As a result, when we have a successful film franchise, we're able to drive industry-leading returns on investment.
At Parks and Resorts, the investment we've made to both maintain a high level of guest experience and to drive demand continue to pay off. In Q2, the segment set new second quarter records in both revenue and operating income. Our domestic operations, in particular, continue to benefit from strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 300 basis points. Attendance at our Domestic parks was comparable to the second quarter last year, and per capita spending was up 8% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5% and occupancy was down 1 percentage point to 88%.
Second quarter results reflect the unfavorable impact of the New Year's holiday shifting into our first fiscal quarter, which was largely offset by the favorable impact of the shift of the Easter holiday. The shift of the Easter holiday period will also have an impact on parks third quarter results as the holiday period fell in the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday period fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, about $90 million in operating income was shifted into Q2 that was recognized in Q3 last year.  Domestic resort reservations for the third quarter are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are down 2%, reflecting the impact of the Easter holiday shift. 
Our cruise business set new second quarter records in revenue and operating income, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. Disney Cruise Line continues to be a market leader in innovation, creativity and guest service. The business achieved record financial performance in 2015, and that strength continues in fiscal 2016 with Disney Cruise Line generating its best first half ever. During the second quarter, we announced plans to build 2 additional ships that will be completed in 2021 and 2023. Our decision to expand the fleet was driven by the outstanding guest response to our product and a business in which we have a strong competitive advantage and where we believe we can drive attractive returns on investment.
Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely excited for the grand opening of the resort, which Bob will discuss in greater detail. 
Operating income at Media Networks was up 9% in the second quarter due to growth in cable, which was primarily driven by higher operating income at ESPN. The higher result at ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs in the second quarter and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming costs and advertising revenue reflect the shift of 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games, including the 2 semifinal games. These games aired during our first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during our second fiscal quarter last year.  The shift in timing of the bowl games had an adverse impact on ESPN's ratings and CPMs in the second quarter, which were partially offset by an increase in units sold. As a result, ESPN's ad revenue was down 13%, but we estimate ad revenue would have been up about 3% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up 5% versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the second quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by lower income from programmed sales compared to prior year as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 5% in the second quarter and benefited from higher rates, but was adversely impacted by lower ratings in the quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing 20% above upfront levels.  Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% adjusted for the adverse impact of foreign exchange and leap day, driven by 4% adjusted affiliate revenue growth at cable and double-digit growth at broadcasting.
At our Consumer Products and Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the quarter. Our Merchandise Licensing business was up in the quarter, but segment results were way down by an adverse impact from foreign exchange as well as lower results from both our Disney stores business and Infinity.  When you look at the segment results, it's important to note our underlying Merchandise Licensing business remains very strong. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 18% in the second quarter. This was driven by strong ongoing demand for Star Wars merchandise, partially offset by the expected difficult year-over-year Frozen comparison. Merchandise Licensing was also impacted by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition in the quarter, which relates to the shift in our fiscal calendar. So while some headwinds and timing related ins and outs impacted second quarter results, we are quite pleased with our first half segment results. Comparable earned licensing revenue was up over 20% for the first half of the fiscal year, which helped drive Merchandise Licensing operating income growth of over 20% and segment operating income growth of 12%.
During the quarter, we took a charge of $147 million in connection with the shutdown of our Infinity console games business. Going forward, our console games strategy will focus solely on licensing our great portfolio of content. 
We continued to actively repurchase our shares, and in the second quarter, we bought back 20.8 million shares for $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we repurchased about 47.3 million shares for approximately $4.9 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Since Christine has already covered our businesses in the quarter, I want to focus on a couple of things we're very excited about: the unbelievable momentum of our Studio and the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Reso",848,"Thanks, Christine, and good afternoon. Since Christine has already covered our businesses in the quarter, I want to focus on a couple of things we're very excited about: the unbelievable momentum of our Studio and the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is now just about a month away. 
Since our acquisition of Pixar, we released 27 movies under the Pixar Disney Animation, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands, with an average global box office of about $770 million each. And as Christine mentioned, the Studio's winning streak continues. This weekend, our 2016 box office total crossed $1 billion domestically, $2 billion internationally and $3 billion globally, reaching those milestones faster than any studio in history. Zootopia's fantastic performance is just the latest in a string of incredibly successful original movies from our animation studios, including Inside Out, Big Hero 6 and Frozen, to name a few.
We're also having tremendous success reimagining Disney classics as exciting live-action movies, most recently with The Jungle Book, a stunning movie pushing the limits of innovation and technology to bring some of our most beloved characters to life in a spectacular new way. It's been gratifying to see the worldwide response. Global box office for The Jungle Book to date is $783 million, including almost $150 million in China. And in India, it's now the highest grossing Hollywood movie in history. And of course, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War just opened around the world to wide acclaim and huge box office. Its domestic debut last weekend generated almost $180 million in box office, making it the fifth biggest opening weekend of all time.  With this success, our Studio has delivered 5 of the top 6 opening weekends on record. Global box office to date for Captain America: Civil War is more than $705 million and climbing. There are now 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe generating almost $10 billion in global box office to date. 
We've got an unprecedented pipeline of terrific movies on the way with major release dates announced through the end of the decade. In the near term, we're looking forward to Alice Through the Looking Glass and Pixar's Finding Dory, which will both be in theaters this summer. 
We are obviously very thrilled with our Studio's performance and its position going forward, but what we're most excited about right now is the grand opening of the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort on June 16. I was there again last week as we were putting the finishing touches on the resort. We began trial operations over the weekend, allowing invited guests to explore the park and enjoy some of the attractions, entertainment and dining experiences. It's incredibly exciting for all of us to see the park truly come alive for the first time, and the initial feedback from guests so far has been absolutely phenomenal. We'll continue to fine-tune everything over the next few weeks to ensure the experience we deliver on opening day is everything we want it to be for our guests.
After 17 years of working on this project, I'm still awed by it. The scale, the detail, the sheer artistry, it's all breathtaking. I find something new to marvel over every time I visit, and I know our guests will do the same. Even though it has all of the Disney details, it's unlike any other destination we've ever created. We set out to build something truly extraordinary, and we've succeeded in a way that far exceeds our most ambitious expectations. We've reimagined everything. Even our most familiar iconic attractions have been elevated and transformed with the help of cutting-edge technology that allows us to take our creativity farther.
Anchoring our first ever pirates themed land, Shanghai's Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure is the first attraction inspired by the blockbuster movie franchise. Its stunning size and incredible technological innovation allow us to immerse our guests in a grand adventure on the high seas like never before. We've also reimagined the Disney Castle, expanding the size and introducing more entertainment, experiences and shopping. And we're introducing new lands in brand-new attraction throughout the park like life cycles. We've taken great care to create a number of stunning features and original experiences, especially for our Chinese guests as well, including some unbelievable entertainment throughout the resort such as our first ever Mandarin production of The Lion King. 
It really is impossible to overstate our excitement about the spectacular resort. It represents the very best that Disney has to offer in a way that is both respectful and relevant to the people of China. Or as we have been saying, it is authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese, and we can't wait to share it with the world. Opening the gates and officially welcoming our first guests will be one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of this phenomenal company, not to mention, a monumental achievement. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Lowell, and Christine and I will be happy to take your questions. Lowell?"

But again, second quarter was very strong at 18%. Star Wars, we all know was a great contributor in Q2, but it didn't have quite the massive contribution it had in Q1. And also remember in Q1, we had the Q4 deferral, the Episode VII merchandise  the revenue associated with at merchandise. So that from Q4 was also moved into Q1, which had a bolstering effect on Q1. We also had a timing issue of guarantee shortfall payments that helped Q1, and they were a drag in Q2 as I mentioned in my comments. And also lastly, I'll mention that Battlefront was a much more significant driver in Q1 than it was in Q2.

Spider-Man is the hottest or is the #1 Marvel character from the consumer merchandise perspective. And reintroducing Spider-Man successfully as we've done and Captain America through the release next year, 2017, of Spider-Man is something that also has to be considered. So it's a kind of business that I think is very difficult to measure in terms of the bottom line success on a quarterly basis. We just don't read it that way."

We feel really good about the opportunity. We are also fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on this strategy. And I also know that there have been questions asked about what the impact of going into the distribution business is on our current distribution partners. And to that, I would respond, even though you didn't ask the question, there are a number of our current distribution partners that are in the content ownership, content creation business, most notably, Comcast and its purchase of NBCUniversal.

We're very encouraged by what we see, but we're not going to disclose what our strategy is going in. question about Hulu, they have -- I don't think they've been specific about when they're going to launch or what their pricing is going to be. But I'll reiterate what I said earlier, and that is we're fully aligned with our partners in 21st Century Fox on plans to launch and what their user interface is and what their approach is in terms of the overall package. We'll have individual negotiations with them for our channels, of course, but we like their strategy from a pricing perspective and in terms of what their ultimate consumer offering our consumer proposition is. I don't think I'll comment much about what we are doing on the SVOD space. Now this is still very dynamic marketplace, and we continue to look for opportunities to sell our content. I will say that we've never seen a better marketplace to sell intellectual property into. And the strategy that we deployed a while ago to invest in the creation of intellectual property is one that we believe in even more today. And we're going to continue to invest more in creating intellectual property. And one of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on 2 of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix. And the fact that Marvel's been in discussions with other distributors as well, and so demand on their products is pretty significant. Plus we're looking at obviously continuing to invest under to the ABC banner, under the Disney banner and potentially under the Lucas banner. So there are many opportunities for us to sell content to a fairly voracious marketplace right now for that content."

There's roughly a $20 differential between peak and off-peak and somewhere in the neighborhood of $76 a day for the peak and $56 for the off-peak. There's also some pricing for children and some pricing for senior citizens. And their reaction to the pricing has actually been quite positive so far as well as reactions to the pricing for our hotels and the pricing for The Lion King show, which is a Mandarin-produced Lion King. It is the full sort of Broadway show, but as a separate ticket. And so far, so good. We've actually had no negative reactions whatsoever to our pricing approach. The value of our intellectual property in China is on the rise. That's obviously as you noted, Jessica, evident in how our movies are doing. It's having a very positive impact on our brand, and our brands that would include Disney and Marvel in particular. We do have Marvel presence in the park. It will grow over time. So there'll be all kinds of opportunities, but it ready for character interaction with Marvel characters. I know that with interest in a recent visit to Disneyland here in California that there was a line early in the morning for our guests to meet Zootopia characters. I can tell you that Zootopia, having done so well in China, there will be Zootopia characters in our park in China sooner than we had originally anticipated. But in general, you're going to find a partner that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property as well as a blend of some original intellectual property, too. We wanted this park to be unique in that it would have things that our other parks and our other locations around the world didn't have, but it's definitely a blend."

On the direct-to-consumer front, we've talked about this often. We're blessed with brands and products that give us the opportunity to take them direct to consumer. It's not always that simple in that we have agreements with distributor, current distributors that have to be considered, although they don't go forever. And obviously, we have to get it right from a technology perspective. I will say that the product that we launched in the U.K., DisneyLife, which was deemed experimental on our part because we really wanted to see not only how consumers behave with a product, but how the pricing should be and whether the technology platform that we created for to put it on would work. And we've been really encouraged by that. We've had great consumer reviews. And we're pleased to say that the transition from basically free to pay has gone really well, too. And so we are looking at other opportunities around the world to distribute that product, too. There's also been great interest in our movies and our television shows on the platform.

Putting her in charge of primetime programming I think is a great move, and I have the utmost confidence in Ben as well. I don't know that there's a big headline here. I've said to Ben what I've said publicly and what -- Ben and I are both in accord on this, and that is you have the look of the business as not just a distribution or network business, but as a content creation business, too. And ABC, under ABC productions, done a great job of creating content that is leveragable beyond the ABC Network into a role that has unbelievable appetite for that content. that's just -- that's just not domestic, that's globally as well. So the goal at ABC is to program the network progressively, but to also support our studio operation aggressively because that is a very, very important, if not integral, component of the value chain. The most obvious that is make great programming. These days, there is so much, there are so many more series that are available to consumers. And it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on programmers not only to make things great, but to make things that make noise, that stand out. And the other thing that and -- that's I think again a given. The other thing that I've mentioned is I don't think we should be held back by any of the old rules. You should think out of the box. The world has changed so much that the old rules just don't always apply. And he needs to, I think, consider that. And that's about it. I've seen all the pilots this year. I have the ability to watch most of them while I was in China last week, believe it or not, and I liked what I see it. As I said earlier I like the marketplace. And I think given the ownership of programming and the fact that a lot of these new shows are ours and a lot of the shows and we put on last year, including Quantico, has done quite well are ours, I feel good about it prospects for that business."

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.",1255,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our financial results this quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, demonstrate once again how the strength of our brands and a relentless focus on creative excellence and execution can continue to drive growth across our businesses and create value for our shareholders.
Our Studio delivered another great quarter, with operating income up 27% versus last year. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the worldwide theatrical success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Disney Animation's Zootopia. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for the Studio, and the first half of fiscal 2016 is off to a record start with over $1.5 billion in operating income due to the phenomenal performance of our film slate. Fiscal year-to-date, Star Wars: The Force Awakens has generated almost $2.1 billion in global box office. Zootopia has generated $960 million, making it the #1 film of the year so far and the second highest grossing Disney Animation Studio film behind Frozen. I'll also note that Zootopia is the #1 animated film of all time in China, grossing over $235 million to date.
The success of our Studio is no accident. It is the result of our strategy of making high-quality branded films and leveraging that success across a number of our integrated businesses. No company does a better job than Disney in creating, cultivating and extending the value of a franchise. As a result, when we have a successful film franchise, we're able to drive industry-leading returns on investment.
At Parks and Resorts, the investment we've made to both maintain a high level of guest experience and to drive demand continue to pay off. In Q2, the segment set new second quarter records in both revenue and operating income. Our domestic operations, in particular, continue to benefit from strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 300 basis points. Attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to the second quarter last year, and per capita spending was up 8% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5% and occupancy was down 1 percentage point to 88%.
Second quarter results reflect the unfavorable impact of the New Year's holiday shifting into our first fiscal quarter, which was largely offset by the favorable impact of the shift of the Easter holiday. The shift of the Easter holiday period will also have an impact on Parks' third quarter results as the holiday period fell in the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday period fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, about $90 million in operating income was shifted into Q2 that was recognized in Q3 last year. Domestic resort reservations for the third quarter are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are down 2%, reflecting the impact of the Easter holiday shift.
Our cruise business set new second quarter records in revenue and operating income, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. Disney Cruise Line continues to be a market leader in innovation, creativity and guest service. The business achieved record financial performance in 2015, and that strength continues in fiscal 2016 with Disney Cruise Line generating its best first half ever. During the second quarter, we announced plans to build 2 additional ships that will be completed in 2021 and 2023. Our decision to expand the fleet was driven by the outstanding guest response to our product and a business in which we have a strong competitive advantage and where we believe we can drive attractive returns on investment.
Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely excited for the grand opening of the resort, which Bob will discuss in greater detail.
Operating income at Media Networks was up 9% in the second quarter due to growth in cable, which was primarily driven by higher operating income at ESPN. The higher result at ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs in the second quarter and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming costs and advertising revenue reflect the shift of 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games, including the 2 semifinal games. These games aired during our first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during our second fiscal quarter last year. The shift in timing of the bowl games had an adverse impact on ESPN's ratings and CPMs in the second quarter, which were partially offset by an increase in units sold. As a result, ESPN's ad revenue was down 13%, but we estimate ad revenue would have been up about 3%, adjusted for the timing of the bowl games. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up 5% versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the second quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by lower income from program sales compared to prior year as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 5% in the second quarter and benefited from higher rates, but was adversely impacted by lower ratings in the quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing 20% above upfront levels. Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5%, adjusted for the adverse impact of foreign exchange and leap day, driven by 4% adjusted affiliate revenue growth at Cable and double-digit growth at Broadcasting.
At our Consumer Products & Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the quarter. Our Merchandise Licensing business was up in the quarter, but segment results were way down by an adverse impact from foreign exchange as well as lower results from both our Disney Stores business and Infinity.  When you look at the segment results, it's important to note our underlying Merchandise Licensing business remains very strong. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 18% in the second quarter. This was driven by strong ongoing demand for Star Wars merchandise, partially offset by the expected difficult year-over-year Frozen comparison. Merchandise Licensing was also impacted by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition in the quarter, which relates to the shift in our fiscal calendar. So while some headwinds and timing-related ins and outs impacted second quarter results, we are quite pleased with our first half segment results. Comparable earned licensing revenue was up over 20% for the first half of the fiscal year, which helped drive Merchandise Licensing operating income growth of over 20% and segment operating income growth of 12%.
During the quarter, we took a charge of $147 million in connection with the shutdown of our Infinity console games business. Going forward, our console game strategy will focus solely on licensing our great portfolio of content.
We continued to actively repurchase our shares, and in the second quarter, we bought back 20.8 million shares for $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased about 47.3 million shares for approximately $4.9 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Since Christine has already covered our businesses in the quarter, I want to focus on a couple of things we're very excited about: The unbelievable momentum of our Studio and the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is now just about a month away.
Since our acquisition of Pixar, we released 27 movies under the Pixar, Disney Animation, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands, with an average global box office of about $770 million each. And as Christine mentioned, the Studio's winning streak continues. This weekend, our 2016 box office total crossed $1 billion domestically, $2 billion internationally and $3 billion globally, reaching those milestones faster than any studio in history. Zootopia's fantastic performance is just the latest in a string of incredibly successful original movies from our animation studios, including Inside Out, Big Hero 6 and Frozen, to name a few.
We're also having tremendous success reimagining Disney classics as exciting live-action movies, most recently with The Jungle Book, a stunning movie pushing the limits of innovation and technology to bring some of our most beloved characters to life in a spectacular new way. It's been gratifying to see the worldwide response. Global box office for The Jungle Book to date is $783 million, including almost $150 million in China. And in India, it's now the highest grossing Hollywood movie in history. And of course, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War just opened around the world to wide acclaim and huge box office. Its domestic debut last weekend generated almost $180 million in box office, making it the fifth biggest opening weekend of all time.  With this success, our Studio has delivered 5 of the top 6 opening weekends on record. Global box office to date for Captain America: Civil War is more than $705 million and climbing. There are now 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe generating almost $10 billion in global box office to date.
We've got an unprecedented pipeline of terrific movies on the way, with major release dates announced through the end of the decade. In the near term, we're looking forward to Alice Through the Looking Glass and Pixar's Finding Dory, which will both be in theaters this summer.
We're obviously very thrilled with our Studio's performance and its position going forward, but what we're most excited about right now is the grand opening of the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort on June 16. I was there again last week as we were putting the finishing touches on the resort. We began trial operations over the weekend, allowing invited guests to explore the park and enjoy some of the attractions, entertainment and dining experiences. It's incredibly exciting for all of us to see the park truly come alive for the first time, and the initial feedback from guests so far has been absolutely phenomenal. We'll continue to fine-tune everything over the next few weeks to ensure the experience we deliver on opening day is everything we want it to be for our guests.
After 17 years of working on this project, I'm still awed by it. The scale, the detail, the sheer artistry, it's all breathtaking. I find something new to marvel over every time I visit, and I know our guests will do the same. Even though it has all of the Disney details, it's unlike any other destination we've ever created. We set out to build something truly extraordinary, and we've succeeded in a way that far exceeds our most ambitious expectations. We've reimagined everything. Even our most familiar iconic attractions have been elevated and transformed with the help of cutting-edge technology that allows us to take our creativity farther.
Anchoring our first ever pirates themed land, Shanghai's Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure is the first attraction inspired by the blockbuster movie franchise. Its stunning size and incredible technological innovation allow us to immerse our guests in a grand adventure on the high seas like never before. We've also reimagined the Disney castle, expanding the size and introducing more entertainment, experiences and shopping. And we're introducing new lands and brand-new attraction throughout the park like the TRON Lightcycles. We've taken great care to create a number of stunning features and original experiences, especially for our Chinese guests as well, including some unbelievable entertainment throughout the resort such as our first ever Mandarin production of The Lion King.
It really is impossible to overstate our excitement about this spectacular resort. It represents the very best that Disney has to offer in a way that is both respectful and relevant to the people of China. Or as we have been saying, it is authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese, and we can't wait to share it with the world. Opening the gates and officially welcoming our first guests will be one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of this phenomenal company, not to mention, a monumental achievement.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Lowell, and Christine and I will be happy to take your questions. Lowell?"

The first quarter growth was 23%, followed by an 8% decline this quarter, and there are several factors that slowed the overall growth rate. The first I'd like to mention is that the earned revenue growth was strong again in Q2 at 18%. Now that compares to an extremely strong growth in Q1 that was 23% in earned revenue growth. But again, second quarter was very strong at 18%. Star Wars, we all know was a great contributor in Q2, but it didn't have quite the massive contribution it had in Q1. And also remember in Q1, we had the Q4 deferral, the Episode VII merchandise, the revenue associated with at merchandise. So that, from Q4 was also moved into Q1, which had a bolstering effect on Q1. We also have a timing issue of guarantee shortfall payments that helped in Q1, and they were a drag in Q2 as I mentioned in my comments. And also lastly, I'll mention that Battlefront was a much more significant driver in Q1 than it was in Q2. And I think if you look at those, that -- those are good contributing factors to the quarter-to-quarter decline."

Now not all is leverageable as Star Wars and Frozen is, for instance, but when you look at Zootopia and you look at Jungle Book, somewhat small so far, but Captain America won't be, and the impact of Captain America long term on that business and the other Marvel properties, the reintroduction of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is the hottest or is the #1 Marvel character from a consumer merchandise perspective. And reintroducing Spider-Man successfully as we've done in Captain America through the release next year, 2017, of Spider-Man is something that also has to be considered. So it's a kind of business that I think is very difficult to measure in terms of the bottom line success on a quarterly basis. We just don't run it that way."

I don't want to speak for them fully, but what they are looking at is a best-of-cable approach, which I guess in response specifically to your question, would put them between the big expanded basic bundle category and some of the lightest packages that are available like some of what Sling has put out. We feel really good about the opportunity. We're also fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on this strategy. And I also know that there have been questions asked about what the impact of going into the distribution business is on our current distribution partners.

We're not going to get into details in terms of our strategy going to the upfront, except that we would agree with what you said. We see a very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront ahead both for our broadcast network for ABC and for ESPN. We're very encouraged with what we see, but we're not going to disclose what our strategy is going in. Your question about Hulu, they have -- I don't think they've been specific about when they're going to launch or what their pricing is going to be. But I'll reiterate what I said earlier, and that is we're fully aligned with our partners in 21st Century Fox on plans to launch, on what their user interface is, on what their approach is in terms of the overall package. We'll have individual negotiations with them for our channels, of course, but we like their strategy from a pricing perspective and in terms of what their ultimate consumer offering or consumer proposition is. I don't think I'll comment much about what we're doing on the SVOD space. Now this is still a very dynamic marketplace, and we continue to look for opportunities to sell our content. I will say that we've never seen a better marketplace to sell intellectual property into. And the strategy that we deployed a while ago to invest in the creation of intellectual property is one that we believe in even more today, and we're going to continue to invest more in creating intellectual property. And one of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on 2 of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix. And the fact that Marvel's been in discussions with other distributors as well, and so demand on their products is pretty significant. Plus we're looking at obviously continuing to invest under to the ABC banner, under the Disney banner and potentially under the Lucas banner. So there are many opportunities for us to sell content to a fairly voracious marketplace right now for that content."

There's roughly a $20 differential between peak and off-peak and somewhere in the neighborhood of $76 a day for the peak and $56 for the off-peak. There's also some pricing for children and some pricing for senior citizens. And the reaction to the pricing has actually been quite positive so far as well as reaction to the pricing for our hotels and the pricing for The Lion King show, which is a Mandarin-produced Lion King. It is the full sort of Broadway show but is a separate ticket. And so far, so good. We've actually had no negative reactions whatsoever to our pricing approach. The value of our intellectual property in China is on the rise. That's obviously as you noted, Jessica, evident in how our movies are doing. It's having a very positive impact on our brand. And our brands, that would include Disney and Marvel in particular. We do have Marvel presence in the park. It will grow over time. So there'll be all kinds of opportunities, particularly for character interaction with Marvel characters. I know that with interest in a recent visit to Disneyland here in California, that there was a line early in the morning for our guests to meet Zootopia characters. I can tell you that Zootopia, having done so well in China, there will be Zootopia characters in our park in China sooner than we had initially anticipated. But in general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property as well as a blend of some original intellectual property, too. We wanted this park to be unique in that it would have things that our other parks and our other locations around the world didn't have, but it's definitely a blend."

It's not always that simple in that we have agreements with distributor -- current distributors that have to be considered, although they don't go forever. And obviously, we have to get it right from a technology perspective. I will say that the product that we launched in the U.K., DisneyLife, which was deemed experimental on our part because we really wanted to see not only how consumers behave with the product but what the pricing should be and whether the technology platform that we created for to put it on would work. And we've been really encouraged by that. We've had great consumer reviews. And we're pleased to say that the transition from basically free to pay has gone really well, too. And so we're looking at other opportunities around the world to distribute that product, too. There's also been great interest in our movies and our television shows on the platform.

But that business is a changing business, and we did not have enough confidence in the business in terms of it being stable enough to stay in it from a self-publishing perspective. You know that you take on substantially more risk, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and managing the inventory, the toy inventory of that business. And in fact, as Christine noted, a good part of the write-off that we just announced comes from having to write off that inventory that we took responsibility for when we went in the publishing business. And we just feel that it's a changing space and that we're just better off at managing the risk that, that business delivers by licensing instead of publishing. It's just that simple. We did fine with the product initially. We actually made a good product. I give the developers a lot of credit for the product that they made. It was extremely well received, but we knew going in that there'd be a lot of risk with this product. And in fact, we did so well initially, gave us the confidence to continue with it.

I've known Channing Dungey for a long time. Putting her in charge of prime time programming I think is a great move, and I have the utmost confidence in Ben, as well. I don't know that there's a big headline here. I've said to Ben what I've said publicly and what -- and Ben and I are both in accord on this, and that is that you have to look at the business as not just a distribution or a network business, but as a content creation business, too. And ABC, under ABC productions, has done a great job of creating content that is leverageable beyond the ABC Network into a world that has an unbelievable appetite for that content. And that's just -- that's not just domestic, that's globally, as well. So the goal at ABC is to program the network aggressively, but to also support our studio operation aggressively because that is a very, very important, if not integral, component of the value chain. The obvious is -- the most obvious in that is make great programming. These days, there is so much, there are so many more series that are available to consumers, and it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on programmers not only to make things great, but to make things that make noise, that stand out. And the other thing that I -- and that's I think again a given. The other thing that I'd mention is I don't think you should be held back by any of the old rules. You should think out of the box. The world has changed so much that the old rules just don't always apply. And he needs to, I think, consider that. And that's about it. I have seen all the pilots this year. I had the ability to watch most of them while I was in China last week, believe it or not, and I like what I see it. As I said earlier, I like the marketplace. And I think given the ownership of programming and the fact that a lot of these new shows are ours and a lot of the shows that we've put on last year, including Quantico, that has done quite well are ours, I feel good about the prospects for that business."

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.",1254,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our financial results this quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, demonstrate once again how the strength of our brands and a relentless focus on creative excellence and execution can continue to drive growth across our businesses and create value for our shareholders.
Our Studio delivered another great quarter, with operating income up 27% versus last year. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the worldwide theatrical success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Disney Animation's Zootopia. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for the Studio, and the first half of fiscal 2016 is off to a record start with over $1.5 billion in operating income due to the phenomenal performance of our film slate. Fiscal year-to-date, Star Wars: The Force Awakens has generated almost $2.1 billion in global box office. Zootopia has generated $960 million, making it the #1 film of the year so far and the second highest grossing Disney Animation Studio film behind Frozen. I'll also note that Zootopia is the #1 animated film of all time in China, grossing over $235 million to date.
The success of our Studio is no accident. It is the result of our strategy of making high-quality branded films and leveraging that success across a number of our integrated businesses. No company does a better job than Disney in creating, cultivating and extending the value of a franchise. As a result, when we have a successful film franchise, we're able to drive industry-leading returns on investment.
At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made to both maintain a high level of guest experience and to drive demand continue to pay off. In Q2, the segment set new second quarter records in both revenue and operating income. Our domestic operations, in particular, continue to benefit from strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 300 basis points. Attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to the second quarter last year, and per capita spending was up 8% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5% and occupancy was down 1 percentage point to 88%.
Second quarter results reflect the unfavorable impact of the New Year's holiday shifting into our first fiscal quarter, which was largely offset by the favorable impact of the shift of the Easter holiday. The shift of the Easter holiday period will also have an impact on Parks' third quarter results as the holiday period fell in the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday period fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, about $90 million in operating income was shifted into Q2 that was recognized in Q3 last year. Domestic resort reservations for the third quarter are pacing up 5% compared to prior-year levels, while booked rates are down 2%, reflecting the impact of the Easter holiday shift.
Our cruise business set new second quarter records in revenue and operating income, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. Disney Cruise Line continues to be a market leader in innovation, creativity and guest service. The business achieved record financial performance in 2015, and that strength continues in fiscal 2016 with Disney Cruise Line generating its best first half ever. During the second quarter, we announced plans to build 2 additional ships that will be completed in 2021 and 2023. Our decision to expand the fleet was driven by the outstanding guest response to our product and a business in which we have a strong competitive advantage and where we believe we can drive attractive returns on investment.
Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely excited for the grand opening of the resort, which Bob will discuss in greater detail.
Operating income at Media Networks was up 9% in the second quarter due to growth in cable, which was primarily driven by higher operating income at ESPN. The higher result at ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs in the second quarter and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming costs and advertising revenue reflect the shift of 6 New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games, including the 2 semifinal games. These games aired during our first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during our second fiscal quarter last year. The shift in timing of the bowl games had an adverse impact on ESPN's ratings and CPMs in the second quarter, which were partially offset by an increase in units sold. As a result, ESPN's ad revenue was down 13%, but we estimate ad revenue would have been up about 3%, adjusted for the timing of the bowl games. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up 5% versus prior year.
Broadcasting operating income was down in the second quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by lower income from program sales compared to prior year, as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up 5% in the second quarter and benefited from higher rates, but was adversely impacted by lower ratings in the quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing 20% above upfront levels. Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 5%, adjusted for the adverse impact of foreign exchange and leap day, driven by 4% adjusted affiliate revenue growth at Cable and double-digit growth at Broadcasting.
At our Consumer Products & Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the quarter. Our Merchandise Licensing business was up in the quarter, but segment results were way down by an adverse impact from foreign exchange, as well as lower results from both our Disney Stores business and Infinity. When you look at the segment results, it's important to note our underlying Merchandise Licensing business remains very strong. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 18% in the second quarter. This was driven by strong ongoing demand for Star Wars merchandise, partially offset by the expected difficult year-over-year Frozen comparison. Merchandise Licensing was also impacted by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition in the quarter, which relates to the shift in our fiscal calendar. So while some headwinds and timing-related ins and outs impacted second quarter results, we are quite pleased with our first half segment results. Comparable earned licensing revenue was up over 20% for the first half of the fiscal year, which helped drive Merchandise Licensing operating income growth of over 20% and segment operating income growth of 12%.
During the quarter, we took a charge of $147 million in connection with the shutdown of our Infinity console games business. Going forward, our console game strategy will focus solely on licensing our great portfolio of content.
We continued to actively repurchase our shares, and in the second quarter, we bought back 20.8 million shares for $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased about 47.3 million shares for approximately $4.9 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Since Christine has already covered our businesses in the quarter, I want to focus on a couple of things we're very excited about: The unbelievable momentum of our Studio and the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is now just about a month away.
Since our acquisition of Pixar, we've released 27 movies under the Pixar, Disney Animation, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands, with an average global box office of about $770 million each. And as Christine mentioned, the Studio's winning streak continues. This weekend, our 2016 box office total crossed $1 billion domestically, $2 billion internationally and $3 billion globally, reaching those milestones faster than any studio in history. Zootopia's fantastic performance is just the latest in a string of incredibly successful original movies from our animation studios, including Inside Out, Big Hero 6 and Frozen, to name a few.
We're also having tremendous success reimagining Disney classics as exciting live-action movies, most recently with The Jungle Book, a stunning movie pushing the limits of innovation and technology to bring some of our most beloved characters to life in a spectacular new way. It's been gratifying to see the worldwide response. Global box office for The Jungle Book to date is $783 million, including almost $150 million in China. And in India, it's now the highest grossing Hollywood movie in history. And of course, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War just opened around the world to wide acclaim and huge box office. Its domestic debut last weekend generated almost $180 million in box office, making it the fifth biggest opening weekend of all time.  With this success, our Studio has delivered 5 of the top 6 opening weekends on record. Global box office to date for Captain America: Civil War is more than $705 million and climbing. There are now 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe generating almost $10 billion in global box office to date.
We've got an unprecedented pipeline of terrific movies on the way, with major release dates announced through the end of the decade. In the near term, we're looking forward to Alice Through the Looking Glass and Pixar's Finding Dory, which will both be in theaters this summer.
We're obviously very thrilled with our Studio's performance and its position going forward, but what we're most excited about right now is the grand opening of the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort on June 16. I was there again last week as we were putting the finishing touches on the resort. We began trial operations over the weekend, allowing invited guests to explore the park and enjoy some of the attractions, entertainment and dining experiences. It's incredibly exciting for all of us to see the park truly come alive for the first time, and the initial feedback from guests so far has been absolutely phenomenal. We'll continue to fine-tune everything over the next few weeks to ensure the experience we deliver on opening day is everything we want it to be for our guests.
After 17 years of working on this project, I'm still awed by it. The scale, the detail, the sheer artistry, it's all breathtaking. I find something new to marvel over every time I visit, and I know our guests will do the same. Even though it has all of the Disney details, it's unlike any other destination we've ever created. We set out to build something truly extraordinary, and we've succeeded in a way that far exceeds our most ambitious expectations. We've reimagined everything. Even our most familiar iconic attractions have been elevated and transformed with the help of cutting-edge technology that allows us to take our creativity farther.
Anchoring our first ever pirates themed land, Shanghai's Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure is the first attraction inspired by the blockbuster movie franchise. Its stunning size and incredible technological innovation allow us to immerse our guests in a grand adventure on the high seas like never before. We've also reimagined the Disney castle, expanding the size and introducing more entertainment, experiences and shopping. And we're introducing new lands and brand-new attractions throughout the park like the TRON Lightcycles. We've taken great care to create a number of stunning features and original experiences, especially for our Chinese guests as well, including some unbelievable entertainment throughout the resort such as our first ever Mandarin production of The Lion King.
It really is impossible to overstate our excitement about this spectacular resort. It represents the very best that Disney has to offer in a way that is both respectful and relevant to the people of China. Or as we have been saying, it is authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese, and we can't wait to share it with the world. Opening the gates and officially welcoming our first guests will be one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of this phenomenal company, not to mention, a monumental achievement.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Lowell, and Christine and I will be happy to take your questions. Lowell?"

The first quarter growth was 23%, followed by an 8% decline this quarter, and there are several factors that slowed the overall growth rate. The first I'd like to mention is that the earned revenue growth was strong again in Q2 at 18%. Now that compares to an extremely strong growth in Q1 that was 23% in earned revenue growth, but again, second quarter was very strong at 18%. Star Wars, we all know was a great contributor in Q2, but it didn't have quite the massive contribution it had in Q1. And also remember in Q1, we had the Q4 deferral, the Episode VII merchandise, the revenue associated with that merchandise. So that from Q4 was also moved into Q1, which had a bolstering effect on Q1. We also have a timing issue of guarantee shortfall payments that helped in Q1, and they were a drag in Q2 as I mentioned in my comments. And also lastly, I'll mention that Battlefront was a much more significant driver in Q1 than it was in Q2. And I think if you look at those, that -- those are good contributing factors to the quarter-to-quarter decline."

Now, not all is leverageable as Star Wars and Frozen is, for instance, but when you look at Zootopia and you look at Jungle Book, somewhat small so far, but Captain America won't be, and the impact of Captain America long term on that business and the other Marvel properties, the reintroduction of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is the hottest -- or is the #1 Marvel character from a consumer merchandise perspective. And reintroducing Spider-Man successfully as we've done in Captain America through the release next year, 2017, of Spider-Man is something that also has to be considered. So it's a kind of business that I think is very difficult to measure in terms of the bottom line success on a quarterly basis. We just don't run it that way."

I don't want to speak for them fully, but what they are looking at is a best-of-cable approach, which I guess in response specifically to your question, would put them between the big expanded basic bundle category and some of the lightest packages that are available like some of what Sling has put out. We feel really good about the opportunity. We're also fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on this strategy. And I also know that there have been questions asked about what the impact of going into the distribution business is on our current distribution partners.

But I'll reiterate what I said earlier, and that is we're fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on plans to launch, on what their user interface is, on what their approach is in terms of the overall package. We'll have individual negotiations with them for our channels, of course, but we like their strategy from a pricing perspective and in terms of what their ultimate consumer offering or consumer proposition is. I don't think I'll comment much about what we're doing on the SVOD space. Now this is still a very dynamic marketplace, and we continue to look for opportunities to sell our content. I will say that we've never seen a better marketplace to sell intellectual property into. And the strategy that we deployed a while ago to invest in the creation of intellectual property is one that we believe in even more today, and we're going to continue to invest more in creating intellectual property. And one of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on 2 of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix. And the fact that Marvel's been in discussions with other distributors as well, and so demand on their products is pretty significant. Plus we're looking at obviously continuing to invest under to the ABC banner, under the Disney banner and potentially under the Lucas banner. So there are many opportunities for us to sell content to a fairly voracious marketplace right now for that content."

There's roughly a $20 differential between peak and off-peak and somewhere in the neighborhood of $76 a day for the peak and $56 for the off-peak. There's also some pricing for children and some pricing for senior citizens. And the reaction to the pricing has actually been quite positive so far, as well as reactions to the pricing for our hotels and the pricing for The Lion King show, which is a Mandarin-produced Lion King. It is the full sort of Broadway show but is a separate ticket and so far, so good. We've actually had no negative reactions whatsoever to our pricing approach. The value of our intellectual property in China is on the rise. That's obviously as you noted, Jessica, evident in how our movies are doing. It's having a very positive impact on our brand and our brands, that would include Disney and Marvel in particular. We do have Marvel presence in the park. It will grow over time. So there'll be all kinds of opportunities, particularly for character interaction with Marvel characters. I noted with interest in a recent visit to Disneyland here in California, that there was a line early in the morning for our guests to meet Zootopia characters. I can tell you that Zootopia, having done so well in China, there will be Zootopia characters in our park in China sooner than we had initially anticipated. But in general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property, as well as a blend of some original intellectual property, too. We wanted this park to be unique in that it would have things that our other parks in our other locations around the world didn't have, but it's definitely a blend."

I know there's been some press reports about your potential interest in MLB's BAM unit. I wonder whether you could, a, perhaps comment on that if you care to. But just maybe more broadly, could you maybe update us on your thinking on potentially taking some of the contracts or content that you have control over and taking it direct-to-consumer?"

I will say that we've been very impressed with their product. It's obviously quite evident if you engage with Major League Baseball on digital platforms, it's probably among the best out there. On the direct-to-consumer front, we've talked about this often. We're blessed with brands and products that give us the opportunity to take them direct-to-consumer. It's not always that simple in that we have agreements with distributor -- current distributors that have to be considered, although they don't go forever. And obviously, we have to get it right from a technology perspective. I will say that the product that we launched in the U.K., DisneyLife, which was deemed experimental on our part because we really wanted to see not only how consumers behaved with the product but what the pricing should be and whether the technology platform that we created for to put it on would work. And we've been really encouraged by that. We've had great consumer reviews. And we're pleased to say that the transition from basically free to pay has gone really well, too. And so we're looking at other opportunities around the world to distribute that product to. There's also been great interest in our movies and our television shows on the platform. But interestingly enough, as time has passed and people are using it more, we're finding they're going to our books, our games, our music, as well. So it's a good product, it seems to be working and we think there are more opportunities for it."

Obviously, with the discussion that's been in the marketplace about the shifting dynamics of distribution and to some extent, some of the sub erosion, that would perhaps call some of that into question. But we would still take our hand in terms of being more subscription-centric than advertising-centric because of -- that we still believe there's much more certainty in that than advertising, which, as you know, has tended to be somewhat cyclical in nature, at times can be fickle in nature based on a variety of other conditions. And as we look at distribution, we still think that there's huge demand for these channels, particularly in the United States, but worldwide, as well.

But that business is a changing business, and we did not have enough confidence in the business in terms of it being stable enough to stay in it from a self-publishing perspective. You know that you take on substantially more risk, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and managing the inventory, the toy inventory of that business. And in fact, as Christine noted, a good part of the write-off that we just announced comes from having to write off that inventory that we took responsibility for when we went in the publishing business. And we just feel that it's a changing space and that we're just better off at managing the risk that, that business delivers by licensing instead of publishing. It's just that simple. We did fine with the product initially. We actually made a good product. I give the developers a lot of credit for the product that they made. It was extremely well received, but we knew going in that there'd be a lot of risk with this product. And the fact that we did so well initially, gave us the confidence to continue with it.

I don't know that there's a big headline here. I've said to Ben what I've said publicly and what -- and Ben and I are both in accord on this, and that is that you have to look at the business as not just a distribution or a network business, but as a content-creation business, too. And ABC, under ABC Productions, has done a great job of creating content that is leverageable beyond the ABC Network into a world that has an unbelievable appetite for that content. And that's just -- that's not just domestic, that's globally, as well. So the goal at ABC is to program the network aggressively, but to also support our studio operation aggressively because that is a very, very important, if not integral, component of the value chain. The obvious is -- the most obvious in that is make great programming. These days, there's so much -- there are so many more series that are available to consumers, and it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on programmers not only to make things great, but to make things that make noise, that stand out. And the other thing that I -- and that's I think again a given. The other thing that I'd mention is I don't think you should be held back by any of the old rules. And you should think out of the box as the world has changed so much that the old rules just don't always apply. And he needs to, I think, consider that. And that's about it. I have seen all the pilots this year. I had the ability to watch most of them while I was in China last week, believe it or not, and I like what I see it. And as I said earlier, I like the marketplace. And I think given the ownership of programming and the fact that a lot of these new shows are ours and a lot of the shows that we've put on last year, including Quantico, that has done quite well are ours, I feel good about the prospects for that business."

I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's resul",1344,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results are continued evidence that the Walt Disney Company's asset mix, especially our brands and franchises, is strong, as is our ability to execute and brand enhancing and value-creating place. We're thrilled with our performance and energized by the great hand of intellectual property and talent that we currently have. But we are also very focused on the challenges and opportunities as the media world continues to evolve and change. As we look at our businesses and the marketplace, 2 things are clear: the multichannel bundle delivers the most value to us and remains a great value proposition to consumers. Therefore, our top priority is to support it and to do what we can to maintain or enhance its value to customers. We also know that new platforms and new entrants in the digital video space are offering consumers more flexibility and variety through exciting new products and impressive user experiences; and we must create or take advantage of these new opportunities in ways that are complementary to the multichannel offering.
With that in mind, earlier today, we announced a significant investment that provides us the technology infrastructure took you to quickly scale and monetize our streaming capabilities at ESPN and across our entire company. We're acquiring a 33% stake in BAMTech, the industry leader in video streaming, data analytics and commerce management. We have the option to acquire majority ownership in the future and through this investment, we plan to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN branded multisports subscription streaming service. Like many others, we're very impressed with the BAMTech platform and investing in joining forces with the BAMTech team will enable us to make a major leap into the direct-to-consumer video space that will also provide countless new opportunities to expand into this space as the marketplace evolves.
Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remains strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape. BAMTech is a critical component of this strategy and the specifics of our investment are provided in our press release about the deal. We continue to work with a wide range of distributors to make our content accessible to consumers in more ways than ever, and I'm pleased to announce that AT&T DIRECTV, the largest distributor in the country, will feature ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior in all subscription packages offered in its upcoming DIRECTV Now OTT service.
A few other notes about ESPN. We just had one of the most exciting and successful NBA Finals ever. And as we began a new contractual term with the NBA, we're enthusiastic about our expanded rights package to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. ESPN also recently announced a new arrangement with the ACC, and starting this month, ESPN subscribers can stream more than 600 exclusive live ACC events through ACC Network Extra on ESPN3, Watch ESPN and ESPN app. And in 2019, we will launch a dedicated linear channel covering all things ACC.
Turning to another area of significant investment for the future, our grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort was a spectacular success by any measure. More than 70 million people in China watched the opening ceremony live on television or digital streaming it after working on this project for more than 17 years, I can't even begin to tell you how thrilled it was to see the park come live with people who are all having a fantastic time. We welcomed well over 1 million guests since we officially opened the gates on June 16, and their reaction has been everything we hoped for and more Ticket are strong. People are staying in the park longer than we ever imagined they would and hotel occupancy is holding steady at 95%. Guest feedback is overwhelmingly positive and people are sharing their experiences widely on social media so guests are now coming to the park with a better understanding of what to expect and how to have the most fun while they're there.
And we have every reason to expect the excitement and enthusiasm will continue. In Shanghai, awareness of our park is virtually universal and intent to visit is extremely high. It's obviously far too early to identify trends to make forecasts or projections, but Shanghai Disney Resort is clearly off to a strong start. Before the gates even opened, we were already planning for the future. Our first expansion is now under construction, and we have plenty of room to add new lands, attractions, hotels and more.
Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to note that our studio is having an absolutely phenomenal year so far, continuing a decade of stunning achievement. Since our 2006 acquisition of Pixar, we have released 29 films under the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animation banners. The average global box office for these movies is about $800 million. 29 films with an average box office of almost $800 million is an astonishing achievement and further testament to our dedication to quality, as well as the immense talent of our studio team and their ability to execute at the highest level. And the box office performance is only part of the equation. We generate substantial added value from these great films across consumer products, television and Parks and Resorts. And we had plenty of great new movies in the pipeline, with the releases scheduled well into the next decade.
Today, I'd like to briefly mentioned 3 major releases still to come in calendar 2016: Moana,  Marvel's Doctor Strange and Rogue One. Moana is an animated musical comedy, fantasy adventure. In other words, another great movie from Disney Animation. In addition to great storytelling and an extraordinary test, Moana also features original music from Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and it will be in theaters at Thanksgiving. Moana follows an incredibly impressive run of films from Disney Animation including Tangled, Wreck it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.
On the Marvel front, the November release of Doctor Strange marks the debut of another incredible character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Judging from the reaction to the cast and the trailer we showed at Comic-Con, fans are as excited about this movie as we are. Actually, fans are pretty excited about everything Marvel shared with them. They've got a lot of great movies to look forward to.
We're also thrilled by the way Star Wars fans are embracing Rogue One, our first standalone Star Wars movie telling the story outside the epic saga. We shared some exclusive footage at the Star Wars celebration event in London last month and the reaction was unbelievable. The level of fan enthusiasm we're seeing for Rogue One is roughly on par with what we saw for The Force Awakens at similar points in the marketing campaign. For example, views for the first Rogue One trailer were about even with the first trailer for The Force Awakens when it debuted, which tells us there's a lot of interest and growing excitement about this movie.
We've also just finished filming Star Wars Episode VIII, we began production on Episode IX and work on 2 more standalone movies as well underway. This kind of great storytelling will always be our first priority, but bringing great stories to consumers in innovative ways is a very close second. So even as we continue to invest for growth as we have for Shanghai Disney Resort, we're also aggressively investing for change with BAMTech being the latest example. We'll continue to use the strength of our incomparable brands: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC and Lucasfilm, as well as our coveted content to lead the way forward driving change and creating value.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to share the details of our Q3 results. Christine?"
191564,371825290,1031802,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results.

I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue for the third fiscal quarter was up 9% compared to the prior year and earnings per share, excluding items of affecting comparability, were up 12% to $1.62. Our studio continues to enjoy unprecedented creative success, which has driven tremendous results at the box office and record financial performance. This calendar year, we've already set new industry records by reaching $2 billion in domestic box office and $5 billion in global box office, faster than any studio in history. Disney holds 4 of the top 5 domestic releases so far in calendar 2016, including Finding Dory, which is #1 with $475 million; and the top 4 global releases, with Captain America: Civil War at approximately $1.2 billion; Zootopia at over $1 billion; The Jungle Book at $940 million; and Finding Dory at $875 million. All of these films were incredibly well reviewed, which is a testament to the creative excellence and incredible execution of the teams behind these films.
The creative and financial success of our studio is truly unprecedented, which was evident once again during the third quarter. Studio operating income was $766 million, over 60% higher during than in third quarter last year and was driven by increases in worldwide theatrical and worldwide home entertainment results. Higher theatrical results reflect the strong performances of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Zootopia, and higher home entertainment results were driven primarily by strong sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia.
The studio segment has generated $2.3 billion in operating income during the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016, which is already surpassed the record full year results the studio delivered during all of fiscal 2015.
Parks and Resorts had another great quarter as segment revenue and operating income set all-time records. These results are particularly notable, given the quarter was negatively impacted by both the timing of the Easter holiday period, which fell on our fiscal second quarter this year compared to our fiscal third quarter last year as well as significant preopening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. This quarter also marked the 21st consecutive year-over-year growth in operating income, which is evidence that our Parks and Resorts business, particularly on the domestic side, is operating at a high level and continues to benefit from key investments supporting world-class intellectual properties, successful execution and prudent cost management.
Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 400 basis points, driven by continued growth in domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 4% in the third quarter, with most of that decline due the adverse impact of the shift in the Easter holiday period. The impact from lower domestic attendance was more than offset by the impact of strong per capita spending, which was up 8% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was down slightly. However, occupancy was 3 percentage points higher at 90%.
Domestic resort reservations for the fourth quarter, excluding the 53rd-week in Q4 fiscal 2015 are pacing up 1% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are pacing up 2%. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened towards the end of the third quarter. As Bob mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. At our other international parks, operating income is lower at Disneyland Paris but we saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income in the third quarter was comparable to Q3 last year as modest growth in cable was offset by a decline at Broadcasting. At cable, we saw nice operating income growth at ESPN driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Growth in affiliate revenue at ESPN resulted from increases in contractual rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ESPN ad revenue was up 5% in the third quarter driven by an increase in units sold. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down compared to prior year. The lower ad sales pacing reflects the difficult comp versus Q4 last year, which included an extra week. Also as expected, we're seeing in some impact in the quarter from the presence of the Olympics.
Disney Channels generated lower income from program sales compared to Q3 last year, which was partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Cable equity income was down in the quarter due primarily to lower income from our investment in A&E. Broadcasting operating income was down in the third quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were more than offset by higher equity losses from our investment in Hulu and lower network ad revenue as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down 4% in the third quarter, as the benefit of higher rates was more than offset by lower ratings compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network continues to be very strong, pacing about 30% above upfront levels. Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Cable affiliate revenue was up 3.5% and would have been about 1 percentage point higher if not for a negative FX impact. Broadcasting affiliate revenue continued to grow nicely and was up double digits for the quarter.
At our Consumer Products and Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the third quarter as decreases in our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses were partially offset by an increase in our games business. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter as growth in licensing revenue from sales of Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen in the prior year and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher revenue share with the studio completed to the prior year. Results in our games business improved compared to third quarter last year due to a reduction in cost as a result of our exiting the Infinity Games business.
As we look ahead, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal fourth quarter results will reflect 1 less week of operations compared to Q4 of last year when we had a 53rd-week due to our fiscal calendar. The extra week essentially drives sporadic increase in annual operating income for the company. However, the impact varies by segment. We estimate last year our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts segments disproportionately benefited from the 53rd week. We continue to actively repurchase our shares and in the third quarter, we bought back 15.2 million shares for $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 65 million shares for approximately $6.6 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

Sony certainly have that experience when it launched Sony Vue without ESPN and then it included it later after the launch and it saw its subs go up substantially. So clearly, we believe by that by putting our products on these platforms, the platform stands a chance of growing faster than they would have without it. Whether it represents -- whether it will result, I guess, in a huge shift, I don't know, I think the consumer has largely been a dictate that but I think it's important to point out that by us being on these platforms, the prices that make sense to us were really quite neutral in terms of shifting from a traditional MVPD consumer to an over-the-top consumer. Meaning the pricing of our networks is similar on the over-the-top networks than it is in the on the MVPD platforms. I guess I could add that -- and I guess the DIRECTV AT&T platform, DIRECTV Now is a great example of this. We think Hulu will be as well. These platforms provide -- will provide great user interface and functionality. And the better the user interface, the better it is for us because we think that this would customer's going to be more engaged and is likely to consume at higher levels, which can only be good for us. So I'd say, look. It's meaningful probably that we're going to be on these platforms. What it means in terms of the distribution of them, we can't say yet meaning its impact on this is going to shift from traditional to more modern forms of distribution. On the other -- on the parks business, I think there's a lot that can be said about the parks business. We clearly have had incredible strength domestically, both at Disneyland and at Disney World. We've had softness in Paris as we've cited. Actually Hong Kong has strengthened. We feel good about the launch of the park in Shanghai, and our cruise ship business is also which is in the parks business, has it been an incredibly strong. We mentioned earlier no impact from Zika. Interestingly enough where there is a paramount concern about the international tourist, the mix of international tourist to our domestic parks hasn't really shifted some that much. We've had shifts market to market. Brazil has had some big issues in the last years for instance. But the mix from international versus domestic attendance is basically in line with what we've seen. And interestingly enough, Great Britain has been fairly strong, which given what's gone on there, particularly the headlines and the Brexit issue, you'd expect otherwise and, of course, also the down versus the dollar. But business is quite stronger. So we think that we've got product domestically and we're continuing to add to that. Avatar great will open in 2017, as well the rest of the buildout of Animal Kingdom. We're investing with our Star Wars IP in both California and in Florida, so that bodes well long term. And we're building 2 new cruise ships, so we feel bullish about the business. And I think that the launch of Shanghai should not go unnoticed in the sense that we built something that was pretty complex and very large and it opened flawlessly. And we know from what we've seen that consumers they're really loves we do have the product, which is evidenced by the fact that they're staying much longer per visit than we ever expected. So we feel good about the business overall. There've been some foreign exchange issues that we've seen but -- and clearly what's happened in Europe on the terrorism front has put a damper on the Paris results. But I think the long-term trajectory of this business is quite strong."

In terms of the international rollout, I don't think we've gotten that specific nor have we gotten specific about pricing. But I think what you'll see over time is that we're going to create a form of dynamic pricing or pricing that is determined in part by the consumer, where the consumer actually has a voice in the nature of the package that they buy. There'll be so much product on that you can buy the whole thing or you can buy parts of the whole and that obviously will have an impact on pricing.

And where we monetize, where we can monetize the most is where the content will go. And right now, the reason MVPD -- multichannel MVPD product is there for your priorities that's where we're monetizing the most. By the way, the same thing is true with other types of products like our movie output deal with Netflix for instance and some of the other deals we've made with Netflix and, Hulu, Amazon other distributors. What will be interesting is long-term to what extent do we hold that product to put on services that are ours that we're selling direct to consumer this is third-party distributors. But it's really premature to get into all of that because right now, we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms for multiple parties, and we're starting to move some product in the direct to consumer fashion like what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife, which again is a complementary service to other subscriptions. In the U.K.'s case, Sky would be the great best example of that where the product it is on DisneyLife is complementary in a way to what is on Sky, and does not really rob or deprive Sky of product because we're monetizing so much better from Sky. I have nothing really new to add on the succession front except that we have a really strong Disney board. They're very focused on the subject of succession and committed to it. They have an ongoing process and we're all confident that it will result in a good decision for the Walt Disney Company and its shareholders long term."

I mean, maybe by way of 1 example, the ACC deal that you talked about in the prepared remarks, the deal that ESPN just signed, will ESPN be able to make available any of that ACC content for example in the over-the-top direct-to-consumer BAMTech ESPN platform, or are those rights at least partially or entirely tied to the linear ESPN where you would need to go back and ask the ACC for the digital rights therefore needing to incrementally invests in the rights to put it on the new platform?

I'm curious if you could tell us a bit more about your visitation there.

I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai, although I'm not going to give you too many numbers. We expected an opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai. And actually, we've been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region. But it's come from all over China. One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit. Now a visitation from Shanghai has also been strong. We did some research and it was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai, and well over 70% intent to visit from the people in Shanghai. So that's really -- those are incredible statistics. I mentioned earlier on the call, that people who are coming and staying almost 2 hours longer than we expected. That's a very good thing because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product, and that in fact is the case because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high. We won't get very specific with you about per caps except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side. And we're also doing very well with our hotels, 95%, 96% occupancy. And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well booked. So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people, not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced. Clearly the marketing has worked and the product is performing really well. And with that in mind, we're already expanding. We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park. We've not announced exactly what it is that we're building, but we're already building to expand. And we have plenty of property, I should remind everyone, so we have an opportunity to build out new lands, new gate, new hotels, new restaurants, et cetera. All very positive."

This quarter's resul",1336,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results are continued evidence that The Walt Disney Company's asset mix, especially our brands and franchises, is strong, as is our ability to execute in brand-enhancing and value-creating ways. 
We're thrilled with our performance and energized by the great hand of intellectual property and talent that we currently have, but we are also very focused on challenges and opportunities as the media world continues to evolve and change. As we look at our businesses and the marketplace, 2 things are clear: the multichannel bundle delivers the most value to us, and it remains great value proposition to consumers. Therefore, our top priority is to support it and to do what we can to maintain or enhance its value to customers. We also know that new platforms and new entrants in the digital video space are offering consumers more flexibility and variety with exciting new products and impressive user experiences, and we must create or take advantage of these new opportunities in ways that are complementary to the multichannel offering.
With that in mind, earlier today, we announced a significant investment that provides us the technology infrastructure to quickly scale and monetize our streaming capabilities at ESPN and across our entire company. We're acquiring a 33% stake in BAMTech, the industry leader in video streaming, data analytics and commerce management. We have the option to acquire majority ownership in the future. And through this investment, we plan to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded multi-sports subscription streaming service. Like many others, we're very impressed with the BAMTech platform, and investing in joining forces with the BAMTech team will enable us to make a major leap into the direct-to-consumer video space that will also provide countless new opportunities to expand into this space as the marketplace evolves. Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remains strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape. BAMTech is a critical component of this strategy, and the specifics of our investment are provided in our press release about the deal. 
We continue to work with a wide range of distributors to make our content accessible to consumers in more ways than ever, and I am pleased to announce that AT&T-DIRECTV, the largest distributor in the country, will feature ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior in all subscription packages offered in its upcoming DIRECTV Now OTT service.
A few other notes about ESPN. We just had one of the most exciting and successful NBA Finals ever. And as we begin a new contractual term with the NBA, we're enthusiastic about our expanded rights package for a sport that continues to grow in popularity. ESPN also recently announced a new arrangement with the ACC. And starting this month, ESPN subscribers can stream more than 600 exclusive live ACC events through ACC Network Extra on ESPN3, WatchESPN and ESPN app. And in 2019, we will launch a dedicated linear channel covering all things ACC.
Turning to another area of significant investment for the future, our grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort was a spectacular success by any measure. More than 70 million people in China watched the opening ceremony live on television or digital streaming. And after working on this project for more than 17 years, I can't even begin to tell you how thrilling it was to see the park come alive with people who are all having a fantastic time. We welcomed well over 1 million guests since we officially opened the gates on June 16, and their reaction has been everything we hoped for and more. Ticket sales are strong. People are staying in the park longer than we ever imagine they would, and hotel occupancy is holding steady at 95%. Guest feedback is overwhelmingly positive, and people are sharing their experiences widely on social media, so guests are now coming to the park with a better understanding of what to expect and how to have the most fun while they're there. And we have every reason to expect the excitement and enthusiasm will continue. In Shanghai, awareness of our park is virtually universal, and intent to visit is extremely high. It's obviously far too early to identify trends and make forecasts or projections, but Shanghai Disney Resort is clearly off to a strong start. Before the gates even opened, we were already planning for the future. Our first expansion is now under construction, and we have plenty of room to add new lands, attractions, hotels and more.
Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to note that our Studio is having an absolutely phenomenal year so far, continuing a decade of stunning achievement. Since our 2006 acquisition of Pixar, we've released 29 films under the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animation banners. The average global box office for these movies is about $800 million. 29 films with an average box office of almost $800 million is an astonishing achievement and further testament to our dedication to quality as well as the immense talent of our Studio team and their ability to execute at the highest level. And the box office performance is only part of the equation. We generate substantial added value from these great films across Consumer Products, television and Parks and Resorts. And we had plenty of great new movies in the pipeline with the releases scheduled well into the next decade.
Today, I'd like to briefly mention 3 major releases still to come in calendar 2016: Moana, Marvel's Doctor Strange and Rogue One. Moana is an animated musical comedy, fantasy adventure. In other words, another great movie from Disney Animation. In addition to great storytelling and an extraordinary test, Moana also features original music from Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and will be in theaters at Thanksgiving. Moana follows an incredibly impressive run of films from Disney Animation, including Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.
On the Marvel front, the November release of Doctor Strange marks the debut of another incredible character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Judging from the reaction to the cast and the trailer we showed at Comic-Con, fans are as excited about this movie as we are. Actually, fans were pretty excited about everything Marvel shared with them. They got a lot of great movies to look forward to.
We're also thrilled by the way Star Wars fans are embracing Rogue One, our first standalone Star Wars movie, telling the story outside the epic saga. We shared some exclusive footage at the Star Wars Celebration event in London last month, and the reaction was unbelievable. The level of fan enthusiasm we're seeing for Rogue One is roughly on par with what we saw for The Force Awakens at similar points in the marketing campaign. For example, views for the first Rogue One trailer were about even with the first trailer for The Force Awakens when it debuted, which tells us there's a lot of interest and growing excitement about this movie. We've also just finished filming Star Wars: Episode VIII. We began production on Episode IX, and work on 2 more standalone movies is well underway. 
This kind of great storytelling will always be our first priority, but bringing great stories to consumers in innovative ways is a very close second. So even as we continue to invest for growth as we have with Shanghai Disney Resort, we're also aggressively investing for change with BAMTech being the latest example. We'll continue to use the strength of our incomparable brands: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC and Lucasfilm as well as our coveted content to lead the way forward driving change and creating value.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to share the details of our Q3 results. Christine?"

I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue for the third fiscal quarter was up 9% compared to prior year; and earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 12% to $1.62. 
Our Studio continues to enjoy unprecedented creative success, which has driven tremendous results at the box office and record financial performance. This calendar year, we've already set new industry records by reaching $2 billion in domestic box office and $5 billion in global box office, faster than any studio in history. Disney holds 4 of the top 5 domestic releases so far in calendar 2016, including Finding Dory, which is #1 with $475 million; and the top 4 global releases with Captain America: Civil War at approximately $1.2 billion; Zootopia at over $1 billion; The Jungle Book at $940 million; and Finding Dory at $875 million. All of these films were incredibly well reviewed, which is a testament to the creative excellence and incredible execution of the teams behind these films.
The creative and financial success of our Studio is truly unprecedented, which was evident once again during the third quarter. Studio operating income was $766 million, over 60% higher than in third quarter last year and was driven by increases in worldwide theatrical and worldwide home entertainment results. Higher theatrical results reflect the strong performances of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Zootopia, and higher home entertainment results were driven primarily by strong sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia. The Studio segment has generated $2.3 billion in operating income during the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016, which has already surpassed the record full year results the Studio delivered during all of fiscal 2015.
Parks and Resorts had another great quarter as segment revenue and operating income set all-time records. These results are particularly notable, given the quarter was negatively impacted by both the timing of the Easter holiday period, which fell on our fiscal second quarter this year, compared to our fiscal third quarter last year as well as significant preopening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. This quarter also marked the 21st consecutive year-over-year growth in operating income, which is evidence that our Parks and Resorts business, particularly on the domestic side, is operating at a high level and continues to benefit from key investments supporting world-class intellectual properties, successful execution and prudent cost management.
Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 400 basis points, driven by continued growth in domestic parks and Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 4% in the third quarter with most of that decline due to the adverse impact of the shift in the Easter holiday period. The impact from lower domestic attendance was more than offset by the impact of strong per capita spending, which was up 8% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was down slightly. However, occupancy was 3 percentage points higher at 90%.
Domestic resort reservations for the fourth quarter, excluding the 53rd week in Q4 of fiscal 2015 are pacing up 1% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are pacing up 2%. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened toward the end of the third quarter. As Bob mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. At our other international parks, operating income is lower at Disneyland Paris, but we saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income in the third quarter was comparable to Q3 last year as modest growth in cable was offset by a decline at broadcasting. At cable, we saw nice operating income growth at ESPN, driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Growth in affiliate revenue at ESPN resulted from increases in contractual rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ESPN ad revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, driven by an increase in units sold. So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales are pacing down compared to prior year. The lower ad sales pacing reflects a difficult comp versus Q4 last year, which included an extra week. Also as expected, we're seeing some impact in the quarter from the presence of the Olympics.
Disney Channels generated lower income from program sales compared to Q3 last year, which was partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Cable equity income was down in the quarter, due primarily to lower income from our investment in A&E. Broadcasting operating income was down in the third quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were more than offset by higher equity losses from our investment in Hulu and lower network ad revenue as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down 4% in the third quarter as the benefit of higher rates was more than offset by lower ratings compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network continues to be very strong, pacing about 30% above upfront levels. Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Cable affiliate revenue was up 3.5% and would have been about 1 percentage point higher if not for a negative FX impact. Broadcasting affiliate revenue continued to grow nicely and was up double digits for the quarter.
At our Consumer Products & Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the third quarter as decreases in our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses were partially offset by an increase in our Games business. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter as growth in licensing revenue from sales of Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen in the prior year and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher revenue share with the Studio compared to prior year. Results in our Games business improved compared to third quarter last year due to a reduction in costs as a result of our exiting the Infinity games business.
As we look ahead, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal fourth quarter results will reflect 1 less week of operations compared to Q4 of last year when we had a 53rd week due to our fiscal calendar. The extra week essentially drives a sporadic increase in annual operating income for the company. However, the impact varies by segment. We estimate last year, our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts segments disproportionately benefited from the 53rd week. 
We continue to actively repurchase our shares. And in the third quarter, we bought back 15.2 million shares for $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 65 million shares for approximately $6.6 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

And if so, sort of how does that impact Disney's strategy or business at all? And then I just have a follow-up on the Parks business, which is continue to be so strong and so impressive.

Sony certainly had that experience when it launched Sony Vue without ESPN, and then it included it later after the launch, and it saw its subs go up substantially. So clearly, we believe that by putting our product on these platforms, the platform stands a chance of growing faster than they would have without it. Whether it represents -- whether it will result, I guess, in a huge shift, I don't know. I think the consumer is largely going to dictate that. But I think it's important to point out that by us being on these platforms of prices that are -- that makes sense to us were really quite neutral in terms of shifting from a traditional MVPD consumer to a over-the-top consumer. Meaning the pricing of our networks is similar on the over-the-top networks than it is in the -- on the MVPD platforms. I guess I could add that -- and I guess the DIRECTV-AT&T platform or DIRECTV Now is a great example of this. We think Hulu will be as well. These platforms provide -- will provide great user interface and functionality. And the better the user interface, the better it is for us because we think that customer is going to be more engaged and is likely to consume at higher levels, which could only be good for us. So I'd say, look, it's meaningful probably that we're going to be on these platforms. What it means in terms of the distribution of them, we can't say yet, meaning its impact on a shift from traditional to more modern forms of distribution. On the other -- on the Parks business, I think there's a lot can be said about the Parks business. We clearly have had incredible strength domestically, both at Disneyland and at Disney World. We've had softness in Paris, as we've cited. Actually Hong Kong has strengthened. We feel great about the launch of the park in Shanghai, and our cruise ship business is also, which is in the Parks business, has been an incredibly strong. We mentioned earlier we've not seen an impact from Zika. Interestingly enough, while there's a fair amount of concern about the international tourist, the mix of international tourist to our domestic parks is -- hasn't really shifted that much. We had shifts market to market. Brazil has had some big issues in the last years for instance. But the mix from international versus domestic attendance is basically in line with what we've seen. And interestingly enough, Great Britain has been fairly strong, which given what's going on there, particularly the headlines and the Brexit issue, you'd expect otherwise and also, of course, the pound versus the dollar. But business is quite strong there. So we're thinking we've got product domestically. We're continuing to add to that. Avatar will open in 2017 as well the rest of the build-out of Animal Kingdom. We're investing with our Star Wars IP in both California and in Florida, so that bodes well long term. And we're building 2 new cruise ships, so we feel bullish about the business. And I think that the launch of Shanghai should not go unnoticed in the sense that we built something that was very complex and very large, and it opened flawlessly. And we know from what we've seen that consumers there really loved the product, which is evidenced by the fact that they're staying much longer per visit than we ever expected. So we feel good about the business overall. There have been some foreign exchange issues that we've seen, but -- and clearly, what's happened in Europe on the terrorism front has put a damper on the Paris results. But I think the long-term trajectory of this business is quite strong."

In terms of the international rollout, I don't think we've gotten that specific nor have we gotten specific about pricing. But I think what you'll see over time is that we're going to create a form of dynamic pricing or pricing that is determined in part by the consumer, which -- where the consumer actually has a voice in the nature of the package that they buy. There'll be so much product on that you can buy the whole thing or you can buy parts of the whole, and that obviously will have an impact on pricing.

And where we monetize -- where we can monetize the most is where the content will go. And right now, the reason the MVPD, multichannel MVPD product is the priority is that's where we're monetizing the most. And by the way, the same thing is true with other types of products like our movie output deal with Netflix, for instance, and some of the other sales that we've made to Netflix with Hulu, Amazon, other distributors. What will be interesting is long term to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we are selling direct to consumer versus third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because right now we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms for multiple parties, and we're starting to move some product in a direct-to-consumer fashion like what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife, which again is a complementary service to other subscriptions. In U.K.'s case, Sky would be the best example of that, where the product it is on DisneyLife is complementary in a way to what is on Sky and does not really rob or deprive Sky of product because we're monetizing so much better from Sky. I have nothing really new to add on the succession front except that we have a really strong Disney board. They're very focused on the subject of succession and committed to it. They have an ongoing process, and we're all confident that it will result in a good decision for The Walt Disney Company and its shareholders long term."

Well, I don't know if you'll comment on Big Ten specifically or not, but just maybe at a high level as we think about rights, fees, growth over time.

And when Brexit occurred, we were already 85% hedged for fiscal '17, so the impact from those currency shifts post-Brexit were very muted for us.

And then of course, we've recently, with Zootopia, had some real success at Disney Animation, which gives us kind of a new franchise to mind, admittedly not nearly as big as some of the other franchises. So there's a lot of activity there. And if you look at the film slate over the next number of years, there's a significant amount of IP. Beauty and the Beast is another coming out in March from the Studio that Consumer Products can mind. Also, let's also recognize the fact that Consumer Products has doubled its earnings over the last 4 years.

We said it's going to be dilutive but very -- in a very modest way, and it's obviously not been a public company, but we're not going to -- we're just not going to get specific about that. I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai although not going to give you too many numbers. We expected an opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai. And actually, we've been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region, but it's come from all over China. One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit. Now a visitation from Shanghai has also been strong. We did some research, and it was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai, and well over 70% intend to visit from the people in Shanghai. So that's really -- those are incredible statistics. I mentioned earlier on the call that people who are coming are staying almost 2 hours longer than we expected. That's a very good thing because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product, and that, in fact, is the case because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high. We won't get very specific with you about per caps except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side. And we're also doing very well with our hotels, 95%, 96% occupancy. And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well booked. So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people, not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced. Clearly, the marketing has worked, and the product is performing really well. And with that in mind, we're already expanding. We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park. We've not announced exactly what it is that we're building, but we're already building to expand. And we have plenty of property, I should remind everyone, so we have an opportunity to build out new lands, new gate, new hotels, new restaurants, et cetera. All very positive."

I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's resul",1336,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results are continued evidence that The Walt Disney Company's asset mix, especially our brands and franchises, is strong, as is our ability to execute in brand-enhancing and value-creating ways. 
We're thrilled with our performance and energized by the great hand of intellectual property and talent that we currently have, but we are also very focused on challenges and opportunities as the media world continues to evolve and change. As we look at our businesses and the marketplace, 2 things are clear: the multichannel bundle delivers the most value to us, and it remains great value proposition to consumers. Therefore, our top priority is to support it and to do what we can to maintain or enhance its value to customers. We also know that new platforms and new entrants in the digital video space are offering consumers more flexibility and variety with exciting new products and impressive user experiences, and we must create or take advantage of these new opportunities in ways that are complementary to the multichannel offering.
With that in mind, earlier today, we announced a significant investment that provides us the technology infrastructure to quickly scale and monetize our streaming capabilities at ESPN and across our entire company. We're acquiring a 33% stake in BAMTech, the industry leader in video streaming, data analytics and commerce management. We have the option to acquire majority ownership in the future. And through this investment, we plan to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded multi-sports subscription streaming service. Like many others, we're very impressed with the BAMTech platform, and investing and joining forces with the BAMTech team will enable us to make a major leap into the direct-to-consumer video space that will also provide countless new opportunities to expand into this space as the marketplace evolves. Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remain strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape. BAMTech is a critical component of this strategy, and the specifics of our investment are provided in our press release about the deal. 
We continue to work with a wide range of distributors to make our content accessible to consumers in more ways than ever, and I am pleased to announce that AT&T-DIRECTV, the largest distributor in the country, will feature ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior in all subscription packages offered in its upcoming DIRECTV Now OTT service.
A few other notes about ESPN. We just had one of the most exciting and successful NBA Finals ever. And as we begin a new contractual term with the NBA, we're enthusiastic about our expanded rights package for a sport that continues to grow in popularity. ESPN also recently announced a new arrangement with the ACC. And starting this month, ESPN subscribers can stream more than 600 exclusive live ACC events through ACC Network Extra on ESPN3, WatchESPN and ESPN app. And in 2019, we will launch a dedicated linear channel covering all things ACC.
Turning to another area of significant investment for the future, our grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort was a spectacular success by any measure. More than 70 million people in China watched the opening ceremony live on television or digital streaming. And after working on this project for more than 17 years, I can't even begin to tell you how thrilling it was to see the park come alive with people who were all having a fantastic time. We welcomed well over 1 million guests since we officially opened the gates on June 16, and their reaction has been everything we've hoped for and more. Ticket sales are strong. People are staying in the park longer than we ever imagined they would, and hotel occupancy is holding steady at 95%. Guest feedback is overwhelmingly positive, and people are sharing their experiences widely on social media, so guests are now coming to the park with a better understanding of what to expect and how to have the most fun while they're there. 
And we have every reason to expect the excitement and enthusiasm will continue. In Shanghai, awareness of our park is virtually universal, and intent to visit is extremely high. It's obviously far too early to identify trends and make forecasts or projections, but Shanghai Disney Resort is clearly off to a strong start. Before the gates even opened, we were already planning for the future. Our first expansion is now under construction, and we have plenty of room to add new lands, attractions, hotels and more.
Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to note that our Studio is having an absolutely phenomenal year so far, continuing a decade of stunning achievement. Since our 2006 acquisition of Pixar, we've released 29 films under the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animation banners. The average global box office for these movies is about $800 million. 29 films with an average box office of almost $800 million is an astonishing achievement and further testament to our dedication to quality as well as the immense talent of our Studio team and their ability to execute at the highest level. And the box office performance is only part of the equation. We generate substantial added value from these great films across Consumer Products, television and Parks and Resorts. And we had plenty of great new movies in the pipeline with the releases scheduled well into the next decade.
Today, I'd like to briefly mention 3 major releases still to come in calendar 2016: Moana, Marvel's Doctor Strange and Rogue One. Moana is an animated musical comedy, fantasy adventure. In other words, another great movie from Disney Animation. In addition to great storytelling and an extraordinary cast, Moana also features original music from Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and will be in theaters at Thanksgiving. Moana follows an incredibly impressive run of films from Disney Animation, including Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.
On the Marvel front, the November release of Doctor Strange marks the debut of another incredible character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Judging from the reaction to the cast and the trailer we showed at Comic-Con, fans are as excited about this movie as we are. Actually, fans were pretty excited about everything Marvel shared with them. They've got a lot of great movies to look forward to.
We're also thrilled by the way Star Wars fans are embracing Rogue One, our first standalone Star Wars movie, telling the story outside the epic saga. We shared some exclusive footage at the Star Wars Celebration event in London last month, and the reaction was unbelievable. The level of fan enthusiasm we're seeing for Rogue One is roughly on par with what we saw for The Force Awakens at similar points in the marketing campaign. For example, views for the first Rogue One trailer were about even with the first trailer for The Force Awakens when it debuted, which tells us there's a lot of interest and growing excitement about this movie. We've also just finished filming Star Wars: Episode VIII. We began production on Episode IX, and work on 2 more standalone movies is well underway. 
This kind of great storytelling will always be our first priority, but bringing great stories to consumers in innovative ways is a very close second. So even as we continue to invest for growth as we have with Shanghai Disney Resort, we're also aggressively investing for change with BAMTech being the latest example. We'll continue to use the strength of our incomparable brands: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC and Lucasfilm as well as our coveted content to lead the way forward driving change and creating value.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to share the details of our Q3 results. Christine?"
191564,371825290,1032242,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results.

I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue for the third fiscal quarter was up 9% compared to prior year; and earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 12% to $1.62. 
Our Studio continues to enjoy unprecedented creative success, which has driven tremendous results at the box office and record financial performance. This calendar year, we've already set new industry records by reaching $2 billion in domestic box office and $5 billion in global box office, faster than any studio in history. Disney holds 4 of the top 5 domestic releases so far in calendar 2016, including Finding Dory, which is #1 with $475 million; and the top 4 global releases with Captain America: Civil War at approximately $1.2 billion; Zootopia at over $1 billion; The Jungle Book at $940 million; and Finding Dory at $875 million. All of these films were incredibly well reviewed, which is a testament to the creative excellence and incredible execution of the teams behind these films.
The creative and financial success of our Studio is truly unprecedented, which was evident once again during the third quarter. Studio operating income was $766 million, over 60% higher than in third quarter last year and was driven by increases in worldwide theatrical and worldwide home entertainment results. Higher theatrical results reflect the strong performances of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Zootopia, and higher home entertainment results were driven primarily by strong sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia. The Studio segment has generated $2.3 billion in operating income during the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016, which has already surpassed the record full year results the Studio delivered during all of fiscal 2015.
Parks and Resorts had another great quarter as segment revenue and operating income set all-time records. These results are particularly notable, given the quarter was negatively impacted by both the timing of the Easter holiday period, which fell on our fiscal second quarter this year, compared to our fiscal third quarter last year as well as significant preopening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. This quarter also marked the 21st consecutive year-over-year growth in operating income, which is evidence that our Parks and Resorts business, particularly on the domestic side, is operating at a high level and continues to benefit from key investments supporting world-class intellectual properties, successful execution and prudent cost management.
Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 400 basis points, driven by continued growth in domestic parks and Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 4% in the third quarter with most of that decline due to the adverse impact of the shift in the Easter holiday period. The impact from lower domestic attendance was more than offset by the impact of strong per capita spending, which was up 8% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was down slightly. However, occupancy was 3 percentage points higher at 90%.
Domestic resort reservations for the fourth quarter, excluding the 53rd week in Q4 of fiscal 2015 are pacing up 1% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are pacing up 2%. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened toward the end of the third quarter. As Bob mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. At our other international parks, operating income is lower at Disneyland Paris, but we saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income in the third quarter was comparable to Q3 last year as modest growth in cable was offset by a decline at broadcasting. At cable, we saw nice operating income growth at ESPN, driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Growth in affiliate revenue at ESPN resulted from increases in contractual rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ESPN ad revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, driven by an increase in units sold. So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales are pacing down compared to prior year. The lower ad sales pacing reflects a difficult comp versus Q4 last year, which included an extra week. Also as expected, we're seeing some impact in the quarter from the presence of the Olympics.
Disney Channels generated lower income from program sales compared to Q3 last year, which was partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Cable equity income was down in the quarter, due primarily to lower income from our investment in A&E. Broadcasting operating income was down in the third quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were more than offset by higher equity losses from our investment in Hulu and lower network ad revenue as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down 4% in the third quarter as the benefit of higher rates was more than offset by lower ratings compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network continues to be very strong, pacing about 30% above upfront levels. Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Cable affiliate revenue was up 3.5% and would have been about 1 percentage point higher if not for a negative FX impact. Broadcasting affiliate revenue continued to grow nicely and was up double digits for the quarter.
At our Consumer Products & Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the third quarter as decreases in our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses were partially offset by an increase in our Games business. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter as growth in licensing revenue from sales of Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen in the prior year and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher revenue share with the Studio compared to prior year. Results in our Games business improved compared to third quarter last year due to a reduction in costs as a result of our exiting the Infinity games business.
As we look ahead, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal fourth quarter results will reflect 1 less week of operations compared to Q4 of last year when we had a 53rd week due to our fiscal calendar. The extra week essentially drives a pro rata increase in annual operating income for the company. However, the impact varies by segment. We estimate last year, our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts segments disproportionately benefited from the 53rd week. 
We continue to actively repurchase our shares. And in the third quarter, we bought back 15.2 million shares for $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 65 million shares for approximately $6.6 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

As we consider that and we look at the marketplace and we look at general growth in Internet-delivered video, particularly live, we think this is a really smart investment for the company, and we really think it's smart strategically because we obviously need this capability to take product like ESPN, Disney and other Disney IP onto similar platforms. So we feel great about that. There is some very slight dilution from this 33% acquisition, however, but we feel really good about the trajectory of this business, obviously by adding IP from the company.

Sony certainly had that experience when it launched Sony Vue without ESPN, and then it included it later after the launch, and it saw its subs go up substantially. So clearly, we believe that by putting our product on these platforms, the platform stands a chance of growing faster than they would have without it. Whether it represents -- whether it will result, I guess, in a huge shift, I don't know. I think the consumer is largely going to dictate that. But I think it's important to point out that by us being on these platforms at prices that are -- that makes sense to us were really quite neutral in terms of shifting from a traditional MVPD consumer to an over-the-top consumer. Meaning the pricing of our networks is similar on the over-the-top networks than it is in the -- on the MVPD platforms. I guess I could add that -- and I guess the DIRECTV-AT&T platform or DIRECTV Now is a great example of this. We think Hulu will be as well. These platforms provide -- will provide great user interface and functionality. And the better the user interface, the better it is for us because we think that customer is going to be more engaged and is likely to consume at higher levels, which could only be good for us. So I'd say, look, it's meaningful probably that we're going to be on these platforms. What it means in terms of the distribution of them, we can't say yet, meaning its impact on a shift from traditional to more modern forms of distribution. On the other -- on the Parks business, I think there's a lot can be said about the Parks business. We clearly have had incredible strength domestically, both at Disneyland and at Disney World. We've had softness in Paris, as we've cited. Actually Hong Kong has strengthened. We feel great about the launch of the park in Shanghai, and our cruise ship business is also, which is in the Parks business, has been an incredibly strong. We mentioned earlier we've not seen an impact from Zika. Interestingly enough, while there's a fair amount of concern about the international tourists, the mix of international tourist to our domestic parks is -- hasn't really shifted that much. We had shifts market to market. Brazil has had some big issues in the last year as a for instance. But the mix from international versus domestic attendance is basically in line with what we've seen. And interestingly enough, Great Britain has been fairly strong, which given what's going on there, particularly the headlines and the Brexit issue, you'd expect otherwise and also, of course, the pound versus the dollar. But business is quite strong there. So we're thinking we've got product domestically. We're continuing to add to that. Avatar will open in 2017 as well the rest of the build-out of Animal Kingdom. We're investing with our Star Wars IP in both California and in Florida, so that bodes well long term. And we're building 2 new cruise ships, so we feel bullish about the business. And I think that the launch of Shanghai should not go unnoticed in the sense that we built something that was very complex and very large, and it opened flawlessly. And we know from what we've seen that consumers there really loved the product, which is evidenced by the fact that they're staying much longer per visit than we ever expected. So we feel good about the business overall. There have been some foreign exchange issues that we've seen, but -- and clearly, what's happened in Europe on the terrorism front has put a damper on the Paris results. But I think the long-term trajectory of this business is quite strong."

In terms of the international rollout, I don't think we've gotten that specific nor have we gotten specific about pricing. But I think what you'll see over time is that we're going to create a form of dynamic pricing or pricing that is determined in part by the consumer, which -- where the consumer actually has a voice in the nature of the package that they buy. There'll be so much product on that you can buy the whole thing or you can buy parts of the whole, and that obviously will have an impact on pricing.

And where we monetize -- where we can monetize the most is where the content will go. And right now, the reason the MVPD, multichannel MVPD product is the priority is that's where we're monetizing the most. And by the way, the same thing is true with other types of products like our movie output deal with Netflix, for instance, and some of the other sales that we've made to Netflix with Hulu, Amazon, other distributors. What will be interesting is long term to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we are selling direct to consumer versus third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because right now we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms for multiple parties, and we're starting to move some product in a direct-to-consumer fashion like what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife, which again is a complementary service to other subscriptions. In U.K.'s case, Sky would be the best example of that, where the product it is on DisneyLife is complementary in a way to what is on Sky and does not really rob or deprive Sky of product because we're monetizing so much better from Sky. I have nothing really new to add on the succession front except that we have a really strong Disney board. They're very focused on the subject of succession and committed to it. They have an ongoing process, and we're all confident that it will result in a good decision for The Walt Disney Company and its shareholders long term."

So it sounds like the answer is no because it's leveraging existing rights that BAM has and that ESPN has, but I just want to make sure that I'm as clear as possible on that. I mean, maybe by way of one example, the ACC deal that you talked about in the prepared remarks, the deal that ESPN just signed, will ESPN be able to make available any of that ACC content, for example, in the over-the-top direct-to-consumer BAMTech, ESPN platform?

Obviously, we're going to be launching an ACC channel and a platform, and we're going to be mindful of the product that we put on that as we go to the distribution world and seek distribution for that. I will say that long term there may be an opportunity to purchase additional rights to put onto this service because the technology is so robust that we actually believe that it does enable us to potentially expand our sports offering, which is something long term down the road we will consider.

I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai although not going to give you too many numbers. We expected, at opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai. And actually, we've been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region, but it's come from all over China. One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit. Now a visitation from Shanghai has also been strong. We did some research, and it was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai, and well over 70% intent to visit from the people in Shanghai. So that's really -- those are incredible statistics. I mentioned earlier on the call that people who are coming are staying almost 2 hours longer than we expected. That's a very good thing because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product, and that, in fact, is the case because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high. We won't get very specific with you about per caps except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side. And we're also doing very well with our hotels, 95%, 96% occupancy. And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well booked. So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people, not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced. Clearly, the marketing has worked, and the product is performing really well. And with that in mind, we're already expanding. We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park. We've not announced exactly what it is that we're building, but we're already building to expand.

This quarter's resul",1336,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share up 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results are continued evidence that The Walt Disney Company's asset mix, especially our brands and franchises, is strong, as is our ability to execute in brand-enhancing and value-creating ways. 
We're thrilled with our performance and energized by the great hand of intellectual property and talent that we currently have, but we are also very focused on challenges and opportunities as the media world continues to evolve and change. As we look at our businesses and the marketplace, 2 things are clear: the multichannel bundle delivers the most value to us, and it remains great value proposition to consumers. Therefore, our top priority is to support it and to do what we can to maintain or enhance its value to customers. We also know that new platforms and new entrants in the digital video space are offering consumers more flexibility and variety with exciting new products and impressive user experiences, and we must create or take advantage of these new opportunities in ways that are complementary to the multichannel offering.
With that in mind, earlier today, we announced a significant investment that provides us the technology infrastructure to quickly scale and monetize our streaming capabilities at ESPN and across our entire company. We're acquiring a 33% stake in BAMTech, the industry leader in video streaming, data analytics and commerce management. We have the option to acquire majority ownership in the future. And through this investment, we plan to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded multi-sports subscription streaming service. Like many others, we're very impressed with the BAMTech platform, and investing and joining forces with the BAMTech team will enable us to make a major leap into the direct-to-consumer video space that will also provide countless new opportunities to expand into this space as the marketplace evolves. Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remain strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape. BAMTech is a critical component of this strategy, and the specifics of our investment are provided in our press release about the deal. 
We continue to work with a wide range of distributors to make our content accessible to consumers in more ways than ever, and I am pleased to announce that AT&T-DIRECTV, the largest distributor in the country, will feature ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior in all subscription packages offered in its upcoming DIRECTV Now OTT service.
A few other notes about ESPN. We just had one of the most exciting and successful NBA Finals ever. And as we begin a new contractual term with the NBA, we're enthusiastic about our expanded rights package for a sport that continues to grow in popularity. ESPN also recently announced a new arrangement with the ACC. And starting this month, ESPN subscribers can stream more than 600 exclusive live ACC events through ACC Network Extra on ESPN3, WatchESPN and ESPN app. And in 2019, we will launch a dedicated linear channel covering all things ACC.
Turning to another area of significant investment for the future, our grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort was a spectacular success by any measure. More than 70 million people in China watched the opening ceremony live on television or digital streaming. And after working on this project for more than 17 years, I can't even begin to tell you how thrilling it was to see the park come alive with people who were all having a fantastic time. We welcomed well over 1 million guests since we officially opened the gates on June 16, and their reaction has been everything we've hoped for and more. Ticket sales are strong. People are staying in the park longer than we ever imagined they would, and hotel occupancy is holding steady at 95%. Guest feedback is overwhelmingly positive, and people are sharing their experiences widely on social media, so guests are now coming to the park with a better understanding of what to expect and how to have the most fun while they're there. 
And we have every reason to expect the excitement and enthusiasm will continue. In Shanghai, awareness of our park is virtually universal, and intent to visit is extremely high. It's obviously far too early to identify trends and make forecasts or projections, but Shanghai Disney Resort is clearly off to a strong start. Before the gates even opened, we were already planning for the future. Our first expansion is now under construction, and we have plenty of room to add new lands, attractions, hotels and more.
Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to note that our Studio is having an absolutely phenomenal year so far, continuing a decade of stunning achievement. Since our 2006 acquisition of Pixar, we've released 29 films under the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animation banners. The average global box office for these movies is about $800 million. 29 films with an average box office of almost $800 million is an astonishing achievement and further testament to our dedication to quality as well as the immense talent of our Studio team and their ability to execute at the highest level. And the box office performance is only part of the equation. We generate substantial added value from these great films across Consumer Products, television and Parks and Resorts. And we had plenty of great new movies in the pipeline with the releases scheduled well into the next decade.
Today, I'd like to briefly mention 3 major releases still to come in calendar 2016: Moana, Marvel's Doctor Strange and Rogue One. Moana is an animated musical comedy, fantasy adventure. In other words, another great movie from Disney Animation. In addition to great storytelling and an extraordinary cast, Moana also features original music from Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and will be in theaters at Thanksgiving. Moana follows an incredibly impressive run of films from Disney Animation, including Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.
On the Marvel front, the November release of Doctor Strange marks the debut of another incredible character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Judging from the reaction to the cast and the trailer we showed at Comic-Con, fans are as excited about this movie as we are. Actually, fans were pretty excited about everything Marvel shared with them. They've got a lot of great movies to look forward to.
We're also thrilled by the way Star Wars fans are embracing Rogue One, our first standalone Star Wars movie, telling the story outside the epic saga. We shared some exclusive footage at the Star Wars Celebration event in London last month, and the reaction was unbelievable. The level of fan enthusiasm we're seeing for Rogue One is roughly on par with what we saw for The Force Awakens at similar points in the marketing campaign. For example, views for the first Rogue One trailer were about even with the first trailer for The Force Awakens when it debuted, which tells us there's a lot of interest and growing excitement about this movie. We've also just finished filming Star Wars: Episode VIII. We began production on Episode IX, and work on 2 more standalone movies is well underway. 
This kind of great storytelling will always be our first priority, but bringing great stories to consumers in innovative ways is a very close second. So even as we continue to invest for growth as we have with Shanghai Disney Resort, we're also aggressively investing for change with BAMTech being the latest example. We'll continue to use the strength of our incomparable brands: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC and Lucasfilm as well as our coveted content to lead the way forward driving change and creating value.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to share the details of our Q3 results. Christine?"

I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue for the third fiscal quarter was up 9% compared to prior year; and earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 12% to $1.62. 
Our Studio continues to enjoy unprecedented creative success, which has driven tremendous results at the box office and record financial performance. This calendar year, we've already set new industry records by reaching $2 billion in domestic box office and $5 billion in global box office, faster than any studio in history. Disney holds 4 of the top 5 domestic releases so far in calendar 2016, including Finding Dory, which is #1 with $475 million; and the top 4 global releases with Captain America: Civil War at approximately $1.2 billion; Zootopia at over $1 billion; The Jungle Book at $940 million; and Finding Dory at $875 million. All of these films were incredibly well reviewed, which is a testament to the creative excellence and incredible execution of the teams behind these films.
The creative and financial success of our Studio is truly unprecedented, which was evident once again during the third quarter. Studio operating income was $766 million, over 60% higher than in third quarter last year and was driven by increases in worldwide theatrical and worldwide home entertainment results. Higher theatrical results reflect the strong performances of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Zootopia, and higher home entertainment results were driven primarily by strong sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia. The Studio segment has generated $2.3 billion in operating income during the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016, which has already surpassed the record full year results the Studio delivered during all of fiscal 2015.
Parks and Resorts had another great quarter as segment revenue and operating income set all-time records. These results are particularly notable, given the quarter was negatively impacted by both the timing of the Easter holiday period, which fell on our fiscal second quarter this year, compared to our fiscal third quarter last year as well as significant preopening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. This quarter also marked the 21st consecutive year-over-year growth in operating income, which is evidence that our Parks and Resorts business, particularly on the domestic side, is operating at a high level and continues to benefit from key investments supporting world-class intellectual properties, successful execution and prudent cost management.
Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 400 basis points, driven by continued growth in domestic parks and Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 4% in the third quarter with most of that decline due to the adverse impact of the shift in the Easter holiday period. The impact from lower domestic attendance was more than offset by the impact of strong per capita spending, which was up 8% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was down slightly. However, occupancy was 3 percentage points higher at 90%.
Domestic resort reservations for the fourth quarter, excluding the 53rd week in Q4 of fiscal 2015 are pacing up 1% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are pacing up 2%. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened toward the end of the third quarter. As Bob mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. At our other international parks, operating income is lower at Disneyland Paris, but we saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland.
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income in the third quarter was comparable to Q3 last year as modest growth in cable was offset by a decline at broadcasting. At cable, we saw nice operating income growth at ESPN, driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Growth in affiliate revenue at ESPN resulted from increases in contractual rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ESPN ad revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, driven by an increase in units sold. So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales are pacing down compared to prior year. The lower ad sales pacing reflects a difficult comp versus Q4 last year, which included an extra week. Also as expected, we're seeing some impact in the quarter from the presence of the Olympics.
Disney Channels generated lower income from program sales compared to Q3 last year, which was partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Cable equity income was down in the quarter, due primarily to lower income from our investment in A&E. Broadcasting operating income was down in the third quarter as growth in affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were more than offset by higher equity losses from our investment in Hulu and lower network ad revenue as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down 4% in the third quarter as the benefit of higher rates was more than offset by lower ratings compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network continues to be very strong, pacing about 30% above upfront levels. Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Cable affiliate revenue was up 3.5% and would have been about 1 percentage point higher if not for a negative FX impact. Broadcasting affiliate revenue continued to grow nicely and was up double digits for the quarter.
At our Consumer Products & Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the third quarter as decreases in our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses were partially offset by an increase in our Games business. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter as growth in licensing revenue from sales of Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen in the prior year and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher revenue share with the Studio compared to prior year. Results in our Games business improved compared to third quarter last year due to a reduction in costs as a result of our exiting the Infinity games business.
As we look ahead, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal fourth quarter results will reflect 1 less week of operations compared to Q4 of last year when we had a 53rd week due to our fiscal calendar. The extra week essentially drives a pro rata increase in annual operating income for the company. However, the impact varies by segment. We estimate last year, our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts segments disproportionately benefited from the 53rd week. 
We continue to actively repurchase our shares. And in the third quarter, we bought back 15.2 million shares for $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 65 million shares for approximately $6.6 billion.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for questions."

As we consider that and we look at the marketplace and we look at general growth in Internet-delivered video, particularly live, we think this is a really smart investment for the company, and we really think it's smart strategically because we obviously need this capability to take product like ESPN, Disney and other Disney IP onto similar platforms. So we feel great about that.

Sony certainly had that experience when it launched Sony Vue without ESPN, and then it included it later after the launch, and it saw its subs go up substantially. So clearly, we believe that by putting our product on these platforms, the platform stands a chance of growing faster than they would have without it. Whether it represents -- whether it will result, I guess, in a huge shift, I don't know. I think the consumer is largely going to dictate that. But I think it's important to point out that by us being on these platforms at prices that are -- that makes sense to us were really quite neutral in terms of shifting from a traditional MVPD consumer to an over-the-top consumer. Meaning the pricing of our networks is similar on the over-the-top networks than it is in the -- on the MVPD platforms. I guess I could add that -- and I guess the DIRECTV-AT&T platform or DIRECTV Now is a great example of this. We think Hulu will be as well. These platforms provide -- will provide great user interface and functionality. And the better the user interface, the better it is for us because we think that customer is going to be more engaged and is likely to consume at higher levels, which could only be good for us. So I'd say, look, it's meaningful probably that we're going to be on these platforms. What it means in terms of the distribution of them, we can't say yet, meaning its impact on a shift from traditional to more modern forms of distribution. On the other -- on the Parks business, I think there's a lot can be said about the Parks business. We clearly have had incredible strength domestically, both at Disneyland and at Disney World. We've had softness in Paris, as we've cited. Actually Hong Kong has strengthened. We feel great about the launch of the park in Shanghai, and our cruise ship business is also, which is in the Parks business, has been an incredibly strong. We mentioned earlier we've not seen an impact from Zika. Interestingly enough, while there's a fair amount of concern about the international tourists, the mix of international tourist to our domestic parks is -- hasn't really shifted that much. We had shifts market to market. Brazil has had some big issues in the last year as a for instance. But the mix from international versus domestic attendance is basically in line with what we've seen. And interestingly enough, Great Britain has been fairly strong, which given what's going on there, particularly the headlines and the Brexit issue, you'd expect otherwise and also, of course, the pound versus the dollar. But business is quite strong there. So we're thinking we've got product domestically. We're continuing to add to that. Avatar will open in 2017 as well the rest of the build-out of Animal Kingdom. We're investing with our Star Wars IP in both California and in Florida, so that bodes well long term. And we're building 2 new cruise ships, so we feel bullish about the business. And I think that the launch of Shanghai should not go unnoticed in the sense that we built something that was very complex and very large, and it opened flawlessly. And we know from what we've seen that consumers there really loved the product, which is evidenced by the fact that they're staying much longer per visit than we ever expected. So we feel good about the business overall. There have been some foreign exchange issues that we've seen, but -- and clearly, what's happened in Europe on the terrorism front has put a damper on the Paris results. But I think the long-term trajectory of this business is quite strong."

The goal is not to take product off ESPN's current channels but to use sports and product that ESPN has already licensed that's not appearing on the channels, and so we view this as a complementary service to what ESPN is already providing as part of their multichannel package, obviously in an over-the-top, direct-to-consumer fashion. In terms of the international rollout, I don't think we've gotten that specific nor have we gotten specific about pricing. But I think what you'll see over time is that we're going to create a form of dynamic pricing or pricing that is determined in part by the consumer, which -- where the consumer actually has a voice in the nature of the package that they buy. There'll be so much product on that you can buy the whole thing or you can buy parts of the whole, and that obviously will have an impact on pricing.

And where we monetize -- where we can monetize the most is where the content will go. And right now, the reason the MVPD, multichannel MVPD product is the priority is that's where we're monetizing the most. And by the way, the same thing is true with other types of products like our movie output deal with Netflix, for instance, and some of the other sales that we've made to Netflix with Hulu, Amazon, other distributors. What will be interesting is long term to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we are selling direct to consumer versus third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because right now we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms for multiple parties, and we're starting to move some product in a direct-to-consumer fashion like what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife, which again is a complementary service to other subscriptions. In U.K.'s case, Sky would be the best example of that, where the product it is on DisneyLife is complementary in a way to what is on Sky and does not really rob or deprive Sky of product because we're monetizing so much better from Sky. I have nothing really new to add on the succession front except that we have a really strong Disney board. They're very focused on the subject of succession and committed to it. They have an ongoing process, and we're all confident that it will result in a good decision for The Walt Disney Company and its shareholders long term."

The new NBA deal that kicks in, we feel great about, even though there's a substantial increase in rights from the last year of the old deal to the first year of the new. We're expanding our rights package with the NBA, and we believe that it's still a sport that's on the rise in terms of popularity. Because live sports is very attractive to distributors to advertisers to consumers, we don't really see the cost abating. There's just a lot of competition for it. There's a lot of demand for the quality that sports represents. And we know that we can't buy everything, so we've made some tough decisions. But we can't look you in the eye and say that costs are going to go down because it's still among the most valuable product that's out there."

So looking -- and you're probably referring to the impact of Brexit and did that have any significant impact, either on '16 or looking forward. On '16, it did not because we were 100% hedged for the year. So changes during this year did not impact our foreign currency exposure. And when Brexit occurred, we were already 85% hedged for fiscal '17, so the impact from those currency shifts post-Brexit were very muted for us.

So -- and we also have Spider-Man being released by Sony but being made by us as well as Thor in calendar 2017, and so we have a lot of Marvel activity as well. And then of course, we've recently, with Zootopia, had some real success at Disney Animation, which gives us kind of a new franchise to mine, admittedly not nearly as big as some of the other franchises. So there's a lot of activity there. And if you look at the film slate over the next number of years, there's a significant amount of IP. Beauty and the Beast is another coming out in March from the Studio that Consumer Products can mine. Also, let's also recognize the fact that Consumer Products has doubled its earnings over the last 4 years. I mean, that's just tremendous, tremendous growth, and it would be hard to top that over the next number of years.

I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai although not going to give you too many numbers. We expected, at opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai. And actually, we've been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region, but it's come from all over China. One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit. Now a visitation from Shanghai has also been strong. We did some research, and it was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai, and well over 70% intent to visit from the people in Shanghai. So that's really -- those are incredible statistics. I mentioned earlier on the call that people who are coming are staying almost 2 hours longer than we expected. That's a very good thing because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product, and that, in fact, is the case because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high. We won't get very specific with you about per caps except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side. And we're also doing very well with our hotels, 95%, 96% occupancy. And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well booked. So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people, not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced. Clearly, the marketing has worked, and the product is performing really well. And with that in mind, we're already expanding. We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park. We've not announced exactly what it is that we're building, but we're already building to expand. And we have plenty of property, I should remind everyone, so we have an opportunity to build out new lands, new gate, new hotels, new restaurants, et cetera. All very positive."

We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.
Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the history of our company: the phenomenal return of Star Wars and the spectacular opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely proud of these accomplishments, which will drive long-term growth for our company.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens exceeded $2 billion in global box office, making it the third highest grossing movie of all time, and we're only just beginning to reap the benefits of our Lucasfilm acquisition.
Next up, we have Rogue One, a fantastic original Star Wars story, opening in December. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be in theaters December of 2017, followed by a stand-alone movie about young Han Solo in 2018. And we'll release Episode IX the following year. Work on all those movies is already underway, and we're thrilled with what we've seen so far.
The magnitude of our Studio's success in fiscal '16 is simply stunning. We released 4 films that broke $1 billion in worldwide box office: The Force Awakens, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia. And Jungle Book came very close with $966 million. Our Studio slate topped a record breaking $7.5 billion in total box office for the year. Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm all contributed to this remarkable achievement, and their creative momentum continues.
Doctor Strange just opened to great numbers, Marvel's 14th consecutive movie to open at #1 at the U.S. box office, and it has already surpassed $377 million worldwide. Our next animated musical, Moana, is already generating great buzz ahead of its opening later this month, and we expect it will join the pantheon of recent hits from Disney Animation alongside Zootopia and Frozen.
Turning to our success in Shanghai. We welcomed 4 million guests in our first 4 months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Some of you may infer from this early performance that we could achieve 10 million in attendance in the park's first year, a number we would be thrilled with, but we're not providing any annual guidance at this point.
I was there last week, and the place looks fantastic. It's very clear our guests are thoroughly enjoying it. They're enthusiastically embracing our stories and characters. Classics like Mickey Mouse are fan favorites, but they love our new IP, too, like Zootopia. And we recently announced we're already expanding the park with the addition of Toy Story Land.
Shanghai Disneyland is now a national tourist destination. More than half our guests come from outside Shanghai, and millions of people across China are developing a much greater awareness and affinity for our brand, which will certainly help drive our growth in that huge market over the long term.
Turning to Media Networks. ESPN grew in fiscal '16, and we expect that growth to continue over the long term. As we saw in [ph] the World Series, people love the excitement, the immediacy and the sheer entertainment of live sports, and ESPN has the richest collection of sports rights in the business, including the NBA, College Football, the College Football Championship, Major League Baseball, College Basketball and the NFL. Our new NBA deal runs through the 2024-2025 season, securing long-term rights to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. The agreement gives us more inventory and more rights than we've ever had and will serve ESPN very well in the years to come.
Maintaining the unequal scope and quality of ESPN's programming is a top priority and so is distributing that valuable content as broadly as possible. And we've made significant strides in that direction, particularly when it comes to licensing ESPN's programming to over-the-top distributors.
In addition to our deals with Sony and Sling, we've recently closed deals with Hulu as well as AT&T Direct, which features ESPN among the 100 channels offered on the new DIRECTV Now service. We believe these new services will ultimately move more millennials into the pay-TV universe, and we're currently in negotiations with other distributors to further expand our presence on these new platforms.
Our recent investment in BAMTech is also targeted at expanding our reach, and we're excited about rolling out our first ESPN-branded content direct to consumers via this platform in 2017. BAMTech is also expanding its business into Europe through a new deal with Discovery.
Over the last several years, we've repeatedly expressed our strong belief that our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets gives us the strongest hand and the best strategic position in the media industry. Our sustained performance clearly demonstrates our ability to use the strength of our incredible assets to drive value, and we are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth.
With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine will detail, fiscal '17 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. We fully expect to return to more robust growth in fiscal '18 and beyond, particularly given the powerful upcoming slate from our Studio. In fiscal '18 alone, we have 4 new Marvel movies, 3 animated films from Pixar and Disney Animation and 2 Star Wars releases, including Episode VIII, which will also benefit our Consumer Products. We have always managed this company for the long term, and our sustained performance reflects the enduring strength of our strategy, the increasing value of our tremendous brands and franchises and our unique ability to consistently leverage creative success across our entire company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to go over the details of our quarter and trends that may impact fiscal '17. Christine?"

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company. Excluding items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter and $5.72 for the full year. We've been able to deliver solid results year-after-year while maintaining a strong balance sheet, which, combined with record operating cash flow of $13.2 billion in fiscal '16, provides tremendous flexibility to make key investments to expand our existing businesses, capitalize on new growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders.
Before I discuss our segment's fourth quarter results, I want to remind you that our Q4 results last year included the benefit of an additional week of operations compared to this year. This 53rd week in our fiscal 2015 calendar makes comparisons of our results a little challenging. While there is an element of imprecision in quantifying the impact, we are going to give you our best assessment of how the 53rd week affected key segments and drivers.
As we've previously discussed, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to our Q4 fiscal '15 results was approximately $350 million in operating income or about $0.13 in earnings per share with the majority of the impact at cable, followed by Parks and Resorts and to a lesser extent, Consumer Products. At Media Networks, we estimate the 53rd week had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about 12 percentage points. As a result, operating income was down 8% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by a decline at cable. The year-over-year change in cable operating income was weighed down in Q4 by about 14 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which adversely affected results at ESPN and Disney Channels and led to a 13% decline in cable operating income for the quarter.
Lower results at ESPN were driven by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to 3 factors: a significant decrease in daily Fantasy advertising, an additional week of ad revenue in Q4 last year and the impact of ad dollars being diverted to Olympics programming.
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing down compared to last year, mostly reflecting the timing of key college football bowl games. This year, ESPN will air only 3 of the new year's 6 ballgames during our fiscal Q1, whereas all 6 games aired during the first fiscal quarter last year. Affiliate revenue was lower in the quarter as higher contractual rates were more than offset by the impact of the 53rd week and a decrease in subscribers.
Turning to Broadcasting. Operating income was higher in the quarter due to growth in affiliate revenue and higher operating income from program sales, partially offset by lower advertising, higher programming costs and an increase in equity losses. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by higher contractual rates. Higher program sales were driven by sales of Luke Cage and Quantico during the quarter.
Programming expenses were up in the quarter as a result of higher cost for network programming, the addition of the Emmy Awards and higher cost for political news coverage. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was adversely impacted by an estimated 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which was the primary driver of the 5% decline in ad revenue during the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 24% above upfront levels.
Turning to affiliate revenue. We estimate the 53rd week and FX had an 8 percentage point adverse impact to Media Networks' affiliate revenue growth, which was down 3% in the quarter. Growth in total cable affiliate revenue was adversely impacted by 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week and FX, which drove a 5% decline in the quarter. During Q4, we also saw solid growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, which once again was up double digits.
At Parks and Resorts, we estimate the 53rd week had a 12 percentage point adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income, which was down 5% in the fourth quarter.
Our underlying domestic business had another great quarter. We estimate the 53rd week created a 16 percentage point headwind to growth and operating income, yet growth in OI at our domestic operations was still up 2%. Operating margins at our domestic operations were up 120 basis points compared to Q4 last year despite an adverse impact of about 120 basis points due to the 53rd week.
Attendance at our domestic parks was down 10% in the quarter, reflecting the additional week of operations in Q4 last year. On a comparable fiscal period basis, attendance was down about 3% as higher attendance at Walt Disney World was more than offset by lower attendance at Disneyland, which was comping against a very strong attendance in Q4 2015 during the park's 60th anniversary celebration.
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1%, and occupancy was up over 2 percentage points to 86%.
While the underlying performance of our domestic business was quite strong in the quarter, operating income at our international operations was lower, driven by about a $100 million decline at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a positive contribution from a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort.
Disneyland Paris continued to experience softness in the quarter due to the lingering effect of terrorism and economic and political uncertainty. While we're disappointed with Disneyland Paris' results in the quarter, we expect to see near-term improvement in connection with the 25th anniversary celebration, which begins in spring 2017.
As Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operation were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year.
At the Studio, operating income was lower for the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year due to lower worldwide theatrical results, partially offset by higher operating income from television distribution. Lower theatrical results reflect the performance of Pete's Dragon and Queen of Katwe in the quarter compared to Ant-Man in Q4 last year as well as higher marketing spending for films yet to be released.
To put things in perspective, while Q4 results were lower compared to last year, our Studio had a phenomenal year with operating income up 37% to a record $2.7 billion.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, we estimate the 53rd week, which weighed on our licensing result, had an adverse impact on segment operating income of about 9 percentage points. As a result, segment operating income declined by 5% due to lower results in our licensing and games businesses. While we continued to see strong sales of Finding Dory merchandise in the fourth quarter, this was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q4 last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased about 16.6 million shares for $1.6 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased about 73.8 million shares for $7.5 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 6.1 million shares for approximately $560 million, and we expect to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year.
As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver modest EPS growth for the year due to some comparability factors. Let's start with cable, where we expect fiscal '17 programming cost to be up about 8% versus fiscal '16, driven primarily by the first year of our new NBA contract, which accounts for $600 million of that increase.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is positioned for continued growth in 2017 due, in part, to the opening of Avatar Land at Walt Disney World and a full year of results from Shanghai Disney Resort.
There are 3 parks comparability items I'd like to mention: First, Hurricane Matthew disrupted our operations at Walt Disney World in early October, which resulted in the closure of our park for about 1.5 days. We estimate the impact of the hurricane on Q1 operating income to be approximately $40 million.  Second, due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the conversion of rooms at Wilderness Lodge to Vacation Club units, Q1 total domestic resort reservations are pacing down about 2%, while booked rates are pacing up 3%; and third, I'd like to point out that 1 week of the winter holiday period will fall in Q2, whereas the entire holiday fell in Q1 last year. As a result, this will shift about $20 million of OI from Q1 into Q2.
Turning to the Studio. Bob discussed the strength of our slate in Q1, and it's worth mentioning, we will also release Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 during the year. While we remain thrilled with our Studio business and the great films we have in the pipeline, I'll remind everyone that results in fiscal '17 will comp against a record breaking 2016 due in part to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while we expect operating income growth for the full year, we expect OI to be down more than 20% in the first quarter due to the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise licensing and our licensed Star Wars: Battlefront game in Q1 last year.
And finally, results in fiscal 2017 will be adversely impacted by about $175 million due to FX rates and higher pension expense. Also, in terms of net interest expense, the $100 million you saw in the fourth quarter represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for the year.
We're very pleased with our fiscal 2016 results, which once again demonstrates that our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content, coupled with great execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation, continues to generate solid earnings growth. Once again, we expect to deliver modest earnings growth in fiscal 2017, and as Bob said, we feel extremely confident that we'll return to more robust earnings growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

I mentioned in my comments the popularity and there are certainly recent examples like the world series of live sports, so I feel really good about their programming. I feel good about their continued ability to drive solid advertising. We have a good sense of what their rate structure is in terms of existing deals with distributors. But we have some opportunities and some new deals to improve the rate structure even more. We have taken a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's sub base. We think that while we were candid a few years -- a year ago in sub losses, we believe that to some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages. But we also believe that new entrants in the marketplace, particularly DMV, digital MVPDs, I should say, our going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, because of their pricing, their user interface, their mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more millennials to either stay in the multichannel ecosystem of subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past. So we just generally feel bullish about ESPN's future. We are, I'd say, realistic about what we've seen with the recent sub trends and again have been I think fairly candid about that. And I think the long-term prospects for the reason I cited for ESPN are good. The other thing that ESPN has, which we've talked about a lot, is the ability to take product out direct to consumer. And that's why we invested in them. And we think that gives us a really interesting opportunity to create a new product. It gives us an interesting opportunity to create product that is more user-friendly and therefore is likely to gain more consumption, and it gives us an ability to mine data from that user consumption that can improve our advertising prospect and give us the ability to tailor the product in a more customized way for those consumers."

Very successfully. And I mentioned 2 things in my earlier comments. One, just the sheer number of people that have come in. But we are also have a fair amount of data already about guest satisfaction. We know that consumers are staying longer. Obviously that's the result of them liking it. And the other thing that's really interesting to us is what a national product this has become. We expected that attendance would be primarily from the Shanghai area, at least in the early months and maybe a couple of years, as word of mouth spread across the country. But the fact that 50% of attendance already is from outside of Shanghai, tells us that this is a product that's resonating across China. And obviously given the population base that China represents, that bodes very well for us. So the product is working. People are coming. They're staying longer. We like the trends that we're seeing generally about spending. Our hotel occupancy is extremely high. We can get into details there but I can tell you that it's very, very high off the bat. We've already made a decision about expansion and that's already begun. And so our outlook for this, and what we even see happening in 2017, is quite positive."

And we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously, when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. But we believe that there are a number of tools we have available to us on the revenue yield management side to create more revenue out of the attendance that we're getting. We also have other kinds of expansion opportunities like hotels for instance, where not only do we have the property, but we've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California that we believe that it would be smart for us to build out more hotels out. We've no announcements to make per se but build more hotels out at both sites and take advantage of what we're seeing there. That clearly is very beneficial to us. And then we've only just begun to mine some of the critical IP that we have created in the last few years, Star Wars being the biggest one. We're building 2 of the biggest lands we've ever built in Orlando and in California. And we think that -- I know you talked about what we've done already, but there's so much more that we can do and so much more we are doing. And I think usually when we talk about the studio, we talk about the studio results that relates to box office and the bottom line for that business. But you also have to think about it in terms of how we mine these assets, not just in the United States but globally at our parks and in Consumer Products. I was in Shanghai last week, and it was just thrilling to see the reaction people are having to those franchises. We have 11 franchises at Consumer Products last year that did $1 billion or more in global retail sales, but you really see that resonating when you go to the Theme Parks. And not just Mickey Mouse and core characters and pirates and things you'd expect, but the lines from characters from Zootopia in Shanghai was significant. So I think there -- we're at a time in that product cycle that the ability to increase profitability from it is really just kicking in."

On the parks question that you asked, we haven't seen a negative impact at Hong Kong due to Shanghai at all. In fact there was some uptick initially on Hong Kong attendance when Shanghai opened. It seems to be an interesting growth in pride locally in Hong Kong in that part. I guess there competitive spirits have somehow rather been stimulated. In terms of what we're seeing in Shanghai, attendance-wise, the makeup of the visitor weekday or post-summer, it's really kind of too early to tell. I will say we've been there last week on 2 weekdays. I was surprised at how many kids are at the park. They were younger kids but there were many more of them when we expected. And we are seeing some interesting patterns already been visitation. I cited 1 just in terms of where we are sourcing the visitors geographically. I don't want to get into too many of the others yet because this will only 4 months in. But the strength of certain days of the week that we didn't expect and some days of the week, there's slightly less strong than we thought initially. But so far, I can say so good. Meaning we really are happy with how this product has launched. Another thing that they haven't really addressed here, but one of the things that we wanted to be incredibly sensitive about and be really good at was the whole notion of entering a new market with this product under what I'll call culturally-sensitive or culturally-correct circumstances.

We have though been exerting Washington, both the executive and the legislative branches, to take a look at the current tax policy of a manic states, particularly the corporate tax rate. And to close more loopholes but lower the corporate tax rate. We are no longer competitive for the rest of the world in that regard, and that must be addressed. And it's possible that given what's gone on this week, that that's likely to be addressed sooner rather than later. That's obviously a good thing. It's also a good thing I think for the market and for most businesses that the transition is already off to what appears to be fairly smooth start. Meaning it looks like there's cordiality, which we have not seen in a long time. And there is an attempt by both sides, the incumbent and the President-elect, to approach this in a rational, cordial I guess the best way -- effective and polite way. That can only be good for business and for the country. And smooth transitions are good. I will say on the smooth transition front, we're going through a smooth transition as well.

But year-over-year, we expect there to be growth in that segment. We also, last quarter, I got a question on Frozen comparisons and I just want to mention it because it still is trickling through in our results.

So I can't really add much except to say that between what Hulu's doing, what Sling has done, what AT&T direct is doing, what others are doing that we're already in negotiation with, we believe that you're going to see a number of different packages brought out, meaning different prices, different bundles. In all cases, we believe the user interface and the technology is going to be very contemporary, and and will be very mobile-friendly. And we think given the pricing and the nature of the product that is coming out, that the opportunity to either keep millennials in as subscribers or to attract them, meaning cause them to subscribe earlier than they may have, is actually very encouraging. And that's one of the reasons why we're more bullish about the future of multichannel TV than perhaps either the marketplace or others are. It doesn't mean there isn't going to be a shift either away from the giant expanded basic bundle or away from some of the traditional distributors. But we believe that there will be plenty of other opportunity. And the other thing that we have to note, which we've said before, is these new entrants in the marketplace are very, very interested in distributing our product. They know the popularity of sports, and in particular ESPN, and they know that it is in their best interest to license that product to launch their service more effectively. And that -- we've seen that time after time after time, negotiation after negotiation, and the pricing to us is also good."

It's the same 8% adjustment for 5% growth. Now, as you know, we'll be filing our 10-K in a couple of weeks, which will provide the affiliate revenue growth drivers for the full year, but let me give you some context now on Q4 affiliate growth. So the 53rd week was a 7-point drag on the Q4 affiliate revenue growth rate or 6-point benefit to that Q4 affiliate growth. Subs were a 2-point drag in the quarter, which is consistent with what we saw last quarter and consistent with what you'll see in the 10-K as the full year impact of subscriber declines.

We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the histor",958,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.
Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the history of our company: the phenomenal return of Star Wars and the spectacular opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely proud of these accomplishments, which will drive long-term growth for our company.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens exceeded $2 billion in global box office, making it the third highest grossing movie of all time, and we're only just beginning to reap the benefits of our Lucasfilm acquisition.
Next up, we have Rogue One, a fantastic original Star Wars story, opening in December. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be in theaters December of 2017, followed by a stand-alone movie about young Han Solo in 2018. And we'll release Episode IX the following year. Work on all those movies is already underway, and we're thrilled with what we've seen so far.
The magnitude of our Studio's success in fiscal '16 is simply stunning. We released 4 films that broke $1 billion in worldwide box office: The Force Awakens, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia. And Jungle Book came very close with $966 million. Our Studio slate topped a record breaking $7.5 billion in total box office for the year. Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm all contributed to this remarkable achievement, and their creative momentum continues.
Doctor Strange just opened to great numbers, Marvel's 14th consecutive movie to open at #1 at the U.S. box office, and it has already surpassed $377 million worldwide. Our next animated musical, Moana, is already generating great buzz ahead of its opening later this month, and we expect it will join the pantheon of recent hits from Disney Animation alongside Zootopia and Frozen.
Turning to our success in Shanghai. We welcomed 4 million guests in our first 4 months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Some of you may infer from this early performance that we could achieve 10 million in attendance in the park's first year, a number we would be thrilled with, but we're not providing any annual guidance at this point.
I was there last week, and the place looks fantastic. It's very clear our guests are thoroughly enjoying it. They're enthusiastically embracing our stories and characters. Classics like Mickey Mouse are fan favorites, but they love our new IP, too, like Zootopia. And we recently announced we're already expanding the park with the addition of Toy Story Land.
Shanghai Disneyland is now a national tourist destination. More than half our guests come from outside Shanghai, and millions of people across China are developing a much greater awareness and affinity for our brand, which will certainly help drive our growth in that huge market over the long term.
Turning to Media Networks. ESPN grew in fiscal '16, and we expect that growth to continue over the long term. As we saw in the World Series, people love the excitement, the immediacy and the sheer entertainment of live sports, and ESPN has the richest collection of sports rights in the business, including the NBA, College Football, the College Football Championship, Major League Baseball, College Basketball and the NFL. Our new NBA deal runs through the 2024-2025 season, securing long-term rights to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. The agreement gives us more inventory and more rights than we've ever had and will serve ESPN very well in the years to come.
Maintaining the unequal scope and quality of ESPN's programming is a top priority and so is distributing that valuable content as broadly as possible. And we've made significant strides in that direction, particularly when it comes to licensing ESPN's programming to over-the-top distributors.
In addition to our deals with Sony and Sling, we've recently closed deals with Hulu as well as AT&T Direct, which features ESPN among the 100 channels offered on the new DIRECTV Now service. We believe these new services will ultimately move more millennials into the pay-TV universe, and we're currently in negotiations with other distributors to further expand our presence on these new platforms.
Our recent investment in BAMTech is also targeted at expanding our reach, and we're excited about rolling out our first ESPN-branded content direct to consumers via this platform in 2017. BAMTech is also expanding its business into Europe through a new deal with Discovery.
Over the last several years, we've repeatedly expressed our strong belief that our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets gives us the strongest hand and the best strategic position in the media industry. Our sustained performance clearly demonstrates our ability to use the strength of our incredible assets to drive value, and we are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth.
With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine will detail, fiscal '17 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. We fully expect to return to more robust growth in fiscal '18 and beyond, particularly given the powerful upcoming slate from our Studio. In fiscal '18 alone, we have 4 new Marvel movies, 3 animated films from Pixar and Disney Animation and 2 Star Wars releases, including Episode VIII, which will also benefit our Consumer Products. We have always managed this company for the long term, and our sustained performance reflects the enduring strength of our strategy, the increasing value of our tremendous brands and franchises and our unique ability to consistently leverage creative success across our entire company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to go over the details of our quarter and trends that may impact fiscal '17. Christine?"

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company. Excluding items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter and $5.72 for the full year. We've been able to deliver solid results year-after-year while maintaining a strong balance sheet, which, combined with record operating cash flow of $13.2 billion in fiscal '16, provides tremendous flexibility to make key investments to expand our existing businesses, capitalize on new growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders.
Before I discuss our segment's fourth quarter results, I want to remind you that our Q4 results last year included the benefit of an additional week of operations compared to this year. This 53rd week in our fiscal 2015 calendar makes comparisons of our results a little challenging. While there is an element of imprecision in quantifying the impact, we are going to give you our best assessment of how the 53rd week affected key segments and drivers.
As we've previously discussed, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to our Q4 fiscal '15 results was approximately $350 million in operating income or about $0.13 in earnings per share with the majority of the impact at cable, followed by Parks and Resorts and to a lesser extent, Consumer Products. At Media Networks, we estimate the 53rd week had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about 12 percentage points. As a result, operating income was down 8% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by a decline at cable. The year-over-year change in cable operating income was weighed down in Q4 by about 14 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which adversely affected results at ESPN and Disney Channels and led to a 13% decline in cable operating income for the quarter.
Lower results at ESPN were driven by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to 3 factors: a significant decrease in daily Fantasy advertising, an additional week of ad revenue in Q4 last year and the impact of ad dollars being diverted to Olympics programming.
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing down compared to last year, mostly reflecting the timing of key college football bowl games. This year, ESPN will air only 3 of the new year's 6 ballgames during our fiscal Q1, whereas all 6 games aired during the first fiscal quarter last year. Affiliate revenue was lower in the quarter as higher contractual rates were more than offset by the impact of the 53rd week and a decrease in subscribers.
Turning to Broadcasting. Operating income was higher in the quarter due to growth in affiliate revenue and higher operating income from program sales, partially offset by lower advertising, higher programming costs and an increase in equity losses. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by higher contractual rates. Higher program sales were driven by sales of Luke Cage and Quantico during the quarter.
Programming expenses were up in the quarter as a result of higher cost for network programming, the addition of the Emmy Awards and higher cost for political news coverage. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was adversely impacted by an estimated 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which was the primary driver of the 5% decline in ad revenue during the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 24% above upfront levels.
Turning to affiliate revenue. We estimate the 53rd week and FX had an 8 percentage point adverse impact to Media Networks' affiliate revenue growth, which was down 3% in the quarter. Growth in total cable affiliate revenue was adversely impacted by 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week and FX, which drove a 5% decline in the quarter. During Q4, we also saw solid growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, which once again was up double digits.
At Parks and Resorts, we estimate the 53rd week had a 12 percentage point adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income, which was down 5% in the fourth quarter.
Our underlying domestic business had another great quarter. We estimate the 53rd week created a 16 percentage point headwind to growth and operating income, yet growth in OI at our domestic operations was still up 2%. Operating margins at our domestic operations were up 120 basis points compared to Q4 last year despite an adverse impact of about 120 basis points due to the 53rd week.
Attendance at our domestic parks was down 10% in the quarter, reflecting the additional week of operations in Q4 last year. On a comparable fiscal period basis, attendance was down about 3% as higher attendance at Walt Disney World was more than offset by lower attendance at Disneyland, which was comping against a very strong attendance in Q4 2015 during the park's 60th anniversary celebration.
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1%, and occupancy was up over 2 percentage points to 86%.
While the underlying performance of our domestic business was quite strong in the quarter, operating income at our international operations was lower, driven by about a $100 million decline at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a positive contribution from a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort.
Disneyland Paris continued to experience softness in the quarter due to the lingering effect of terrorism and economic and political uncertainty. While we're disappointed with Disneyland Paris' results in the quarter, we expect to see near-term improvement in connection with the 25th anniversary celebration, which begins in spring 2017.
As Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operation were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year.
At the Studio, operating income was lower for the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year due to lower worldwide theatrical results, partially offset by higher operating income from television distribution. Lower theatrical results reflect the performance of Pete's Dragon and Queen of Katwe in the quarter compared to Ant-Man in Q4 last year as well as higher marketing spending for films yet to be released.
To put things in perspective, while Q4 results were lower compared to last year, our Studio had a phenomenal year with operating income up 37% to a record $2.7 billion.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, we estimate the 53rd week, which weighed on our licensing result, had an adverse impact on segment operating income of about 9 percentage points. As a result, segment operating income declined by 5% due to lower results in our licensing and games businesses. While we continued to see strong sales of Finding Dory merchandise in the fourth quarter, this was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q4 last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased about 16.6 million shares for $1.6 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased about 73.8 million shares for $7.5 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 6.1 million shares for approximately $560 million, and we expect to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year.
As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver modest EPS growth for the year due to some comparability factors. Let's start with cable, where we expect fiscal '17 programming cost to be up about 8% versus fiscal '16, driven primarily by the first year of our new NBA contract, which accounts for $600 million of that increase.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is positioned for continued growth in 2017 due in part to the opening of Avatar Land at Walt Disney World and a full year of results from Shanghai Disney Resort.
There are 3 parks comparability items I'd like to mention: First, Hurricane Matthew disrupted our operations at Walt Disney World in early October, which resulted in the closure of our park for about 1.5 days. We estimate the impact of the hurricane on Q1 operating income to be approximately $40 million.  Second, due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the conversion of rooms at Wilderness Lodge to Vacation Club units, Q1 total domestic resort reservations are pacing down about 2%, while booked rates are pacing up 3%; and third, I'd like to point out that 1 week of the winter holiday period will fall in Q2, whereas the entire holiday fell in Q1 last year. As a result, this will shift about $20 million of OI from Q1 into Q2.
Turning to the Studio. Bob discussed the strength of our slate in Q1, and it's worth mentioning, we will also release Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 during the year. While we remain thrilled with our Studio business and the great films we have in the pipeline, I'll remind everyone that results in fiscal '17 will comp against a record breaking 2016 due in part to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while we expect operating income growth for the full year, we expect OI to be down more than 20% in the first quarter due to the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise licensing and our licensed Star Wars: Battlefront game in Q1 last year.
And finally, results in fiscal 2017 will be adversely impacted by about $175 million due to FX rates and higher pension expense. Also, in terms of net interest expense, the $100 million you saw in the fourth quarter represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for the year.
We're very pleased with our fiscal 2016 results, which once again demonstrates that our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content, coupled with great execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation, continues to generate solid earnings growth. Once again, we expect to deliver modest earnings growth in fiscal 2017, and as Bob said, we feel extremely confident that we'll return to more robust earnings growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

I mentioned in my comments the popularity, and there are certainly recent examples like the World Series of live sports. So I feel really good about their programming. I feel good about their continued ability to drive solid advertising. We have a good sense of what their rate structure is in terms of existing deals with distributors, but we have some opportunities and some new deals to improve the rate structure even more. We have taken a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's sub base. We think that while we were candid a few years -- a year ago in sub losses, we believe that, to some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages. But we also believe that new entrants in the marketplace, particularly DMVDs -- digital MVPDs, I should say, are going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, because of their pricing, the user interface, their mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more millennials to either stay in the multi-channel ecosystem of subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past. So we just generally feel bullish about ESPN's future. We are, I'd say, realistic about what we've seen in -- with recent sub trends and again, have been, I think, fairly candid about that. And we think the long-term prospects for the reason I cited for ESPN are good. The other thing that ESPN has, which we've talked about a lot, is the ability to take product out direct to consumer, and that's why we invested in BAM. And we think that gives us a really interesting opportunity to create a new product. It gives us an interesting opportunity to create product that is more user friendly and therefore, is likely to gain more consumption, and it gives us an ability to mine data from that user consumption that can improve our advertising prospects and give us the ability to tailor the product more -- in a more customized way for those consumers."

Christine may want to address it a little bit from a financial perspective, but this has opened very successfully, very successfully. And I mentioned 2 things in my earlier comments: one, just the sheer number of people that have come in, but we also have a fair amount of data already about guest satisfaction. We know that consumers are staying longer. Obviously, that's the result of them liking it. And the other thing that's really interesting to us is what a national product this has become. We expected that attendance would be primarily from the Shanghai area at least in the early months and maybe a couple of years as word of mouth spread across the country. But the fact that 50% of attendance already is from outside of Shanghai tells us that this is a product that's resonating across China. And obviously, given the population base that China represents, that bodes very well for us. So the product is working. People are coming. They're staying longer. We like the trends that we're seeing generally about spending. Our hotel occupancy is extremely high. We can get into details there, but I can tell you that it's very, very high off the bat. We've already made a decision about expansion, and that's already begun. And so our outlook for this and what we even see happening in 2017 is quite positive."

And we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously, when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. But we believe that there are a number of tools we have available to us on the revenue yield management side to create more revenue out of the attendance that we're getting. We also have other kinds of expansion opportunities like hotels, for instance, where not only do we have the property, but when we've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California that we believe that it would be smart for us to build more hotels out. We have no announcements to make per se but build more hotels out at both sites and take advantage of what we're seeing there. That clearly is very beneficial to us. And then we've only just begun to mine some of the critical IP that we have created in the last few years, Star Wars being the biggest one. We're building 2 of the biggest lands we've ever built in Orlando and in California. And we think that -- I know you talked about what we've done already, but there's so much more that we can do and so much more we are doing. And I think, usually when we talk about the Studio, we talk about the Studio results that relates to box office and the bottom line for that business, but you also have to think about it in terms of how we mine these assets not just in the United States but globally at our parks and in Consumer Products. I was in Shanghai last week, and it was just thrilling to see the reaction people are having to those franchises. Look, we had 11 franchises at Consumer Products last year that did $1 billion or more in global retail sales, but you really see that resonating when you go to the theme parks. And not just Mickey Mouse and core characters and pirates and things you'd expect but the line for characters from Zootopia in Shanghai was significant. So I think there -- and we're at a time in that product cycle that the ability to increase profitability from it is really just kicking in."

But I think it would be -- it's far too early for us to suggest that we're concerned. It's still the highest rated sports programming that's out there, and we think we're lucky that we've got it licensed on a long-term basis. Look, it's clear also, the most important thing the NFL can do is to maintain quality. And it just could be that what we're seeing among the contributors is that the matchups or the strength of certain teams, particularly some of the teams that have done extremely well in the past is not what it was, and that could just be aberrational.

Let's use the parks as an example of what we're doing at Imagineering, where the significant investment in new technology to improve the guest experience -- and that, by the way, includes how guests buy access to our parks, the whole online sale or e-commerce experience as -- for instance. We're redoing disneystore.com using basically better technological tools, another example. BAM, clearly, was what I was mostly referring to because that is an investment in a technology platform aimed at strengthening our technology capabilities so that we can strengthen our business. On the parks question that you asked, we haven't seen a negative impact at Hong Kong due to Shanghai at all. In fact, there was some uptick initially on Hong Kong attendance when Shanghai opened, and it seems to be an interesting growth in pride locally in Hong Kong in that park. I guess, their competitive spirits have somehow rather been stimulated. In terms of what we're seeing in Shanghai attendance wise and the makeup of the visitor weekday or post summer, it's really kind of too early to tell. I will say, having been there last week on 2 weekdays, I was surprised at how many kids were in the park. They were younger kids, but there were many more of them what we expected. And we are seeing some interesting patterns already with visitation. I cited one just in terms of where we're sourcing visitors geographically. I don't want to get into too many of the others yet because this -- we're only 4 months in. But the strength of certain days of the week that we didn't expect and some days of the week are slightly less strong than we thought initially. But so far, I can say so good, meaning we really are happy with how this product has launched. Another thing that I haven't really addressed here but one of the things that we wanted to be incredibly sensitive about and be really good at was the whole notion of entering a new market with this product under what I'll call culturally sensitive or culturally correct circumstances, opening something that the people of China actually -- that resonated with them in terms of their experience, and that has been letter-perfect."

And it's possible that given what's gone on this week, that, that's likely to be addressed sooner rather than later. That's obviously a good thing. It's also a good thing, I think, for the market and for most businesses that the transition is already off to what appears to be fairly smooth start, meaning it looks like there's cordiality, which we have not seen in a long time, and there is an attempt by both sides, the incumbent and the President-elect, to approach this in a rational, cordial, I guess, the best way -- effective and polite way.

And the other thing that we have to note, which we said before, is these new entrants in the marketplace are very, very interested in distributing our product.

We thought the Nielsen numbers, when they were released -- we continue to think this by the way, are an anomaly in terms of what the industry overall is seeing. And further, they contradicted what other respected third-party observers and experts had been saying and telling us. So we've exhorted Nielsen to take a very careful look at their -- basically their methodology. They're obviously an important business to us because of the service they provide, particularly on the advertising side. But given the fact that what they provided was an anomaly and given the fact that it contradicted what other observers were seeing, we think it's important that more scrutiny is given to it. In addition to that, Nielsen is currently not measuring digital subs. We've talked to them about the need to do that, and they have talked about doing it. But we believe, given the growth in these digital platforms, that needs to happen on a much more timely, faster basis than it has been happening. That basically, I think, is in a nutshell."

We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the histor",957,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.
Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the history of our company: the phenomenal return of Star Wars and the spectacular opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely proud of these accomplishments, which will drive long-term growth for our company.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens exceeded $2 billion in global box office, making it the third highest grossing movie of all time, and we're only just beginning to reap the benefits of our Lucasfilm acquisition.
Next up, we have Rogue One, a fantastic original Star Wars story, opening in December. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be in theaters December of 2017, followed by a stand-alone movie about young Han Solo in 2018. And we'll release Episode IX the following year. Work on all those movies is already underway, and we're thrilled with what we've seen so far.
The magnitude of our Studio's success in fiscal '16 is simply stunning. We released 4 films that broke $1 billion in worldwide box office: The Force Awakens, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia. And Jungle Book came very close with $966 million. Our Studio slate topped a record-breaking $7.5 billion in total box office for the year. Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm all contributed to this remarkable achievement, and their creative momentum continues.
Doctor Strange just opened to great numbers, Marvel's 14th consecutive movie to open at #1 at the U.S. box office, and it has already surpassed $377 million worldwide. Our next animated musical, Moana, is already generating great buzz ahead of its opening later this month, and we expect it will join the pantheon of recent hits from Disney Animation alongside Zootopia and Frozen.
Turning to our success in Shanghai. We welcomed 4 million guests in our first 4 months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Some of you may infer from this early performance that we could achieve 10 million in attendance in the park's first year, a number we would be thrilled with, but we're not providing any annual guidance at this point.
I was there last week, and the place looks fantastic. It's very clear our guests are thoroughly enjoying it. They're enthusiastically embracing our stories and characters. Classics like Mickey Mouse are fan favorites, but they love our new IP, too, like Zootopia. And we recently announced we're already expanding the park with the addition of Toy Story Land.
Shanghai Disneyland is now a national tourist destination. More than half our guests come from outside Shanghai, and millions of people across China are developing a much greater awareness and affinity for our brand, which will certainly help drive our growth in that huge market over the long term.
Turning to Media Networks. ESPN grew in fiscal '16, and we expect that growth to continue over the long term. As we saw with the World Series, people love the excitement, the immediacy and the sheer entertainment of live sports, and ESPN has the richest collection of sports rights in the business, including the NBA, College Football, the College Football Championship, Major League Baseball, College Basketball and the NFL. Our new NBA deal runs through the 2024-2025 season, securing long-term rights to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. The agreement gives us more inventory and more rights than we've ever had and will serve ESPN very well in the years to come.
Maintaining the unequaled scope and quality of ESPN's programming is a top priority and so is distributing that valuable content as broadly as possible. And we've made significant strides in that direction, particularly when it comes to licensing ESPN's programming to over-the-top distributors.
In addition to our deals with Sony and Sling, we've recently closed deals with Hulu as well as AT&T Direct, which features ESPN among the 100 channels offered on the new DIRECTV Now service. We believe these new services will ultimately move more millennials into the pay-TV universe, and we're currently in negotiations with other distributors to further expand our presence on these new platforms.
Our recent investment in BAMTech is also targeted at expanding our reach, and we're excited about rolling out our first ESPN-branded content direct to consumers via this platform in 2017. BAMTech is also expanding its business into Europe through a new deal with Discovery.
Over the last several years, we've repeatedly expressed our strong belief that our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets gives us the strongest hand and the best strategic position in the media industry. Our sustained performance clearly demonstrates our ability to use the strength of our incredible assets to drive value, and we are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth.
With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine will detail, fiscal '17 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. We fully expect to return to more robust growth in fiscal '18 and beyond, particularly given the powerful upcoming slate from our Studio. In fiscal '18 alone, we have 4 new Marvel movies, 3 animated films from Pixar and Disney Animation and 2 Star Wars releases, including Episode VIII, which will also benefit our Consumer Products. We have always managed this company for the long term, and our sustained performance reflects the enduring strength of our strategy, the increasing value of our tremendous brands and franchises and our unique ability to consistently leverage creative success across our entire company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to go over the details of our quarter and trends that may impact fiscal '17. Christine?"

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company. Excluding items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter and $5.72 for the full year. We've been able to deliver solid results year-after-year while maintaining a strong balance sheet, which, combined with record operating cash flow of $13.2 billion in fiscal '16, provides tremendous flexibility to make key investments to expand our existing businesses, capitalize on new growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders.
Before I discuss our segment's fourth quarter results, I want to remind you that our Q4 results last year included the benefit of an additional week of operations compared to this year. This 53rd week in our fiscal 2015 calendar makes comparisons of our results a little challenging. While there is an element of imprecision in quantifying the impact, we are going to give you our best assessment of how the 53rd week affected key segments and drivers.
As we've previously discussed, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to our Q4 fiscal '15 results was approximately $350 million in operating income or about $0.13 in earnings per share with the majority of the impact at cable, followed by Parks and Resorts and to a lesser extent, Consumer Products. At Media Networks, we estimate the 53rd week had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about 12 percentage points. As a result, operating income was down 8% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by a decline at cable. The year-over-year change in cable operating income was weighed down in Q4 by about 14 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which adversely affected results at ESPN and Disney Channels and led to a 13% decline in cable operating income for the quarter.
Lower results at ESPN were driven by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to 3 factors: a significant decrease in daily Fantasy advertising, an additional week of ad revenue in Q4 last year and the impact of ad dollars being diverted to Olympics programming.
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing down compared to last year, mostly reflecting the timing of key college football bowl games. This year, ESPN will air only 3 of the new year's 6 ballgames during our fiscal Q1, whereas all 6 games aired during the first fiscal quarter last year. Affiliate revenue was lower in the quarter as higher contractual rates were more than offset by the impact of the 53rd week and a decrease in subscribers.
Turning to Broadcasting. Operating income was higher in the quarter due to growth in affiliate revenue and higher operating income from program sales, partially offset by lower advertising, higher programming cost and an increase in equity losses. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by higher contractual rates. Higher program sales were driven by sales of Luke Cage and Quantico during the quarter.
Programming expenses were up in the quarter as a result of higher costs for network programming, the addition of the Emmy Awards and higher costs for political news coverage. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was adversely impacted by an estimated 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which was the primary driver of the 5% decline in ad revenue during the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 24% above upfront levels.
Turning to affiliate revenue. We estimate the 53rd week and FX had an 8 percentage point adverse impact to Media Networks' affiliate revenue growth, which was down 3% in the quarter. Growth in total cable affiliate revenue was adversely impacted by 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week and FX, which drove a 5% decline in the quarter. During Q4, we also saw solid growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, which once again was up double digits.
At Parks and Resorts, we estimate the 53rd week had a 12 percentage point adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income, which was down 5% in the fourth quarter.
Our underlying domestic business had another great quarter. We estimate the 53rd week created a 16 percentage point headwind to growth and operating income, yet growth in OI at our domestic operations was still up 2%. Operating margins at our domestic operations were up 120 basis points compared to Q4 last year despite an adverse impact of about 120 basis points due to the 53rd week.
Attendance at our domestic parks was down 10% in the quarter, reflecting the additional week of operations in Q4 last year. On a comparable fiscal period basis, attendance was down about 3% as higher attendance at Walt Disney World was more than offset by lower attendance at Disneyland, which was comping against a very strong attendance in Q4 2015 during the park's 60th anniversary celebration.
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1%, and occupancy was up over 2 percentage points to 86%.
While the underlying performance of our domestic business was quite strong in the quarter, operating income at our international operations was lower, driven by about a $100 million decline at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a positive contribution from a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort.
Disneyland Paris continued to experience softness in the quarter due to the lingering effect of terrorism and economic and political uncertainty. While we're disappointed with Disneyland Paris' results in the quarter, we expect to see near-term improvement in connection with the 25th anniversary celebration, which begins in spring 2017.
As Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operation were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year.
At the Studio, operating income was lower for the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year due to lower worldwide theatrical results, partially offset by higher operating income from television distribution. Lower theatrical results reflect the performance of Pete's Dragon and Queen of Katwe in the quarter compared to Ant-Man in Q4 last year as well as higher marketing spending for films yet to be released.
To put things in perspective, while Q4 results were lower compared to last year, our Studio had a phenomenal year with operating income up 37% to a record $2.7 billion.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, we estimate the 53rd week, which weighed on our licensing result, had an adverse impact on segment operating income of about 9 percentage points. As a result, segment operating income declined by 5% due to lower results in our licensing and games businesses. While we continued to see strong sales of Finding Dory merchandise in the fourth quarter, this was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q4 last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased about 16.6 million shares for $1.6 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased about 73.8 million shares for $7.5 billion. So far this quarter, we've repurchased 6.1 million shares for approximately $560 million, and we expect to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year.
As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver modest EPS growth for the year due to some comparability factors. Let's start with cable, where we expect fiscal '17 programming cost to be up about 8% versus fiscal '16, driven primarily by the first year of our new NBA contract, which accounts for $600 million of that increase.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is positioned for continued growth in 2017 due in part to the opening of Avatar Land at Walt Disney World and a full year of results from Shanghai Disney Resort.
There are 3 parks comparability items I'd like to mention: First, Hurricane Matthew disrupted our operations at Walt Disney World in early October, which resulted in the closure of our parks for about 1.5 days. We estimate the impact of the hurricane on Q1 operating income to be approximately $40 million.  
Second, due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the conversion of rooms at Wilderness Lodge to Vacation Club units, Q1 total domestic resort reservations are pacing down about 2%, while booked rates are pacing up 3%.
And third, I'd like to point out that 1 week of the winter holiday period will fall in Q2, whereas the entire holiday fell in Q1 last year. As a result, this will shift about $20 million of OI from Q1 into Q2.
Turning to the Studio. Bob discussed the strength of our slate in Q1, and it's worth mentioning, we will also release Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 during the year. While we remain thrilled with our Studio business and the great films we have in the pipeline, I'll remind everyone that results in fiscal '17 will comp against a record-breaking 2016 due in part to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while we expect operating income growth for the full year, we expect OI to be down more than 20% in the first quarter due to the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise licensing and our licensed Star Wars: Battlefront game in Q1 last year.
And finally, results in fiscal 2017 will be adversely impacted by about $175 million due to FX rates and higher pension expense. Also, in terms of net interest expense, the $100 million you saw in the fourth quarter represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for the year.
We're very pleased with our fiscal 2016 results, which once again demonstrate that our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content, coupled with great execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation, continues to generate solid earnings growth. Once again, we expect to deliver modest earnings growth in fiscal 2017, and as Bob said, we feel extremely confident that we'll return to more robust earnings growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

I mentioned in my comments the popularity, and there are certainly recent examples like the World Series of live sports. So I feel really good about their programming. I feel good about their continued ability to drive solid advertising. We have a good sense of what their rate structure is in terms of existing deals with distributors, but we have some opportunities and some new deals to improve the rate structure even more. We have taken a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's sub base. We think that while we were candid a few years -- a year ago in sub losses, we believe that, to some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages. But we also believe that new entrants in the marketplace, particularly DMVDs -- digital MVPDs, I should say, are going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, because of their pricing, their user interface, their mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more millennials to either stay in the multi-channel ecosystem of subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past. So we just generally feel bullish about ESPN's future. We are, I'd say, realistic about what we've seen in -- with recent sub trends and again, have been, I think, fairly candid about that. And we think the long-term prospects for the reason I cited for ESPN are good. The other thing that ESPN has, which we've talked about a lot, is the ability to take product out direct to consumer, and that's why we invested in BAM. And we think that gives us a really interesting opportunity to create a new product. It gives us an interesting opportunity to create product that is more user friendly and therefore, is likely to gain more consumption, and it gives us an ability to mine data from that user consumption that can improve our advertising prospects and give us the ability to tailor the product more -- in a more customized way for those consumers."

Christine may want to address it a little bit from a financial perspective, but this has opened very successfully, very successfully. And I mentioned 2 things in my earlier comments: one, just the sheer number of people that have come in, but we also have a fair amount of data already about guest satisfaction. We know that consumers are staying longer. Obviously, that's the result of them liking it. And the other thing that's really interesting to us is what a national product this has become. We expected that attendance would be primarily from the Shanghai area at least in the early months and maybe a couple of years as word of mouth spread across the country. But the fact that 50% of attendance already is from outside of Shanghai tells us that this is a product that's resonating across China. And obviously, given the population base that China represents, that bodes very well for us. So the product is working. People are coming. They're staying longer. We like the trends that we're seeing generally about spending. Our hotel occupancy is extremely high. We didn't get into details there, but I can tell you that it's very, very high off the bat. We've already made a decision about expansion, and that's already begun. And so our outlook for this and what we even see happening in 2017 is quite positive."

And we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously, when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. But we believe that there are a number of tools we have available to us on the revenue yield management side to create more revenue out of the attendance that we're getting. We also have other kinds of expansion opportunities like hotels, for instance, where not only do we have the property, but when we've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California that we believe that it would be smart for us to build more hotels out. We have no announcements to make per se but build more hotels out at both sites and take advantage of what we're seeing there. That clearly is very beneficial to us. And then we've only just begun to mine some of the critical IP that we have created in the last few years, Star Wars being the biggest one. We're building 2 of the biggest lands we've ever built in Orlando and in California. And we think that -- I know you talked about what we've done already, but there's so much more that we can do and so much more we are doing. And I think, usually when we talk about the Studio, we talk about the Studio results as it relates to box office and the bottom line for that business, but you also have to think about it in terms of how we mine these assets not just in the United States but globally at our parks and in Consumer Products. I was in Shanghai last week, and it was just thrilling to see the reaction people are having to those franchises. Look, we had 11 franchises at Consumer Products last year that did $1 billion or more in global retail sales, but you really see that resonating when you go to the theme parks. And not just Mickey Mouse and core characters and pirates and things you'd expect but the line for characters from Zootopia in Shanghai was significant. So I think there -- and we're at a time in that product cycle that the ability to increase profitability from it is really just kicking in."

On the parks question that you asked, we haven't seen a negative impact at Hong Kong due to Shanghai at all. In fact, there was some uptick initially on Hong Kong attendance when Shanghai opened, and it seems to be an interesting growth in pride locally in Hong Kong in that park. I guess their competitive spirits have somehow or another been stimulated. In terms of what we're seeing in Shanghai attendance wise and the makeup of the visitor weekday or post summer, it's really kind of too early to tell. I will say, having been there last week on 2 weekdays, I was surprised at how many kids were in the park. They were younger kids, but there were many more of them what we expected. And we are seeing some interesting patterns already with visitation. I cited one just in terms of where we're sourcing visitors geographically. I don't want to get into too many of the others yet because this -- we're only 4 months in. But the strength of certain days of the week that we didn't expect and some days of the week are slightly less strong than we thought initially. But so far, I can say so good, meaning we really are happy with how this product has launched. Another thing that I haven't really addressed here but one of the things that we wanted to be incredibly sensitive about and be really good at was the whole notion of entering a new market with this product under what I'll call culturally sensitive or culturally correct circumstances, opening something that the people of China actually -- that resonated with them in terms of their experience, and that has been letter-perfect."

While I did note a challenging first quarter operating income performance, once again, that is going to be primarily due to the difficult comp we have last year to Star Wars. And as you remember, last year, we also had the fourth quarter revenue recognized in our first quarter, so it made it even a little more challenging than just a straight quarter, but year-over-year, we expect there to be growth in that segment. We also -- last quarter, I got a question on Frozen comparisons, and I just want to mention it because it still is trickling through in our results. But we did see difficult comps for the phenomenal performance that we had in Frozen, and we saw those in fiscal '16 in the second, third and fourth quarter.

So I can't really add much except to say that between what Hulu is doing, what Sling has done, what AT&T Direct is doing, what others are doing we're already in negotiation with, we believe that you're going to see a number of different packages brought out, meaning different prices, different bundles. In all cases, we believe the user interface and the technology is going to be very contemporary and will be very mobile friendly. And we think given the pricing and the nature of the product that is coming out, that the opportunity to either keep millennials in as subscribers or to attract them, meaning cause them to subscribe earlier than they may have, is actually very encouraging. And that's one of the reasons why we're more bullish about the future of multi-channel TV than perhaps either the marketplace or others are. Doesn't mean there isn't going to be a shift either away from the giant expanded basic bundle or away from some of the traditional distributors, but we believe that there will be plenty of other opportunities. And the other thing that we have to note, which we've said before, is these new entrants in the marketplace are very, very interested in distributing our product. They know the popularity of sports, and in particular, ESPN, and they know that it is in their best interest to license that product to launch their service more effectively. And that's something -- we've seen that time after time after time, negotiation after negotiation, and the pricing, to us, is also good."

For Media Networks affiliate revenue -- and the reason I'm saying this, the numbers are close, but they're flipped, it's down 3% with the same 8% adjustment for a 5% growth. Now as you know, we'll be filing our 10-K in a couple weeks, which will provide the affiliate revenue growth drivers for the full year, but let me give you some context now on Q4 affiliate growth. So the 53rd week was a 7 point drag on the Q4 affiliate revenue growth rate or a 6 point benefit to that Q4 affiliate growth. Subs were a 2 point drag in the quarter, which is consistent with what we saw last quarter and consistent with what you'll see in the 10-K as the full year impact of subscriber declines.

They're obviously an important business to us because of the service they provide, particularly on the advertising side. But given the fact that what they provided was an anomaly and given the fact that it contradicted what other observers were seeing, we think it's important that more scrutiny is given to it. In addition to that, Nielsen is currently not measuring digital subs. We've talked to them about the need to do that, and they have talked about doing it.

So with that, let me turn it over to Bob, and we can get started."

We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the histor",957,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%.
Fiscal 2016 also included 2 of the most important achievements in the history of our company: the phenomenal return of Star Wars and the spectacular opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely proud of these accomplishments, which will drive long-term growth for our company.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens exceeded $2 billion in global box office, making it the third highest grossing movie of all time, and we're only just beginning to reap the benefits of our Lucasfilm acquisition.
Next up, we have Rogue One, a fantastic original Star Wars story, opening in December. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be in theaters December of 2017, followed by a stand-alone movie about young Han Solo in 2018. And we'll release Episode IX the following year. Work on all those movies is already underway, and we're thrilled with what we've seen so far.
The magnitude of our Studio's success in fiscal '16 is simply stunning. We released 4 films that broke $1 billion in worldwide box office: The Force Awakens, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia. And Jungle Book came very close with $966 million. Our Studio slate topped a record-breaking $7.5 billion in total box office for the year. Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm all contributed to this remarkable achievement, and their creative momentum continues.
Doctor Strange just opened to great numbers, Marvel's 14th consecutive movie to open at #1 at the U.S. box office, and it has already surpassed $377 million worldwide. Our next animated musical, Moana, is already generating great buzz ahead of its opening later this month, and we expect it will join the pantheon of recent hits from Disney Animation alongside Zootopia and Frozen.
Turning to our success in Shanghai. We welcomed 4 million guests in our first 4 months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Some of you may infer from this early performance that we could achieve 10 million in attendance in the park's first year, a number we would be thrilled with, but we're not providing any annual guidance at this point.
I was there last week, and the place looks fantastic. It's very clear our guests are thoroughly enjoying it. They're enthusiastically embracing our stories and characters. Classics like Mickey Mouse are fan favorites, but they love our new IP, too, like Zootopia. And we recently announced we're already expanding the park with the addition of Toy Story Land.
Shanghai Disneyland is now a national tourist destination. More than half our guests come from outside Shanghai, and millions of people across China are developing a much greater awareness and affinity for our brand, which will certainly help drive our growth in that huge market over the long term.
Turning to Media Networks. ESPN grew in fiscal '16, and we expect that growth to continue over the long term. As we saw with the World Series, people love the excitement, the immediacy and the sheer entertainment of live sports, and ESPN has the richest collection of sports rights in the business, including the NBA, College Football, the College Football Championship, Major League Baseball, College Basketball and the NFL. Our new NBA deal runs through the 2024-2025 season, securing long-term rights to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. The agreement gives us more inventory and more rights than we've ever had and will serve ESPN very well in the years to come.
Maintaining the unequaled scope and quality of ESPN's programming is a top priority and so is distributing that valuable content as broadly as possible. And we've made significant strides in that direction, particularly when it comes to licensing ESPN's programming to over-the-top distributors.
In addition to our deals with Sony and Sling, we've recently closed deals with Hulu as well as AT&T Direct, which features ESPN among the 100 channels offered on the new DIRECTV Now service. We believe these new services will ultimately move more millennials into the pay-TV universe, and we're currently in negotiations with other distributors to further expand our presence on these new platforms.
Our recent investment in BAMTech is also targeted at expanding our reach, and we're excited about rolling out our first ESPN-branded content direct to consumers via this platform in 2017. BAMTech is also expanding its business into Europe through a new deal with Discovery.
Over the last several years, we've repeatedly expressed our strong belief that our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets gives us the strongest hand and the best strategic position in the media industry. Our sustained performance clearly demonstrates our ability to use the strength of our incredible assets to drive value, and we are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth.
With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine will detail, fiscal '17 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. We fully expect to return to more robust growth in fiscal '18 and beyond, particularly given the powerful upcoming slate from our Studio. In fiscal '18 alone, we have 4 new Marvel movies, 3 animated films from Pixar and Disney Animation and 2 Star Wars releases, including Episode VIII, which will also benefit our Consumer Products. We have always managed this company for the long term, and our sustained performance reflects the enduring strength of our strategy, the increasing value of our tremendous brands and franchises and our unique ability to consistently leverage creative success across our entire company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to go over the details of our quarter and trends that may impact fiscal '17. Christine?"
191564,382921073,1084658,"The Walt Disney Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results, which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company. Excluding items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter and $5.72 for the full year. We've been able to deliver solid results year-after-year while maintaining a strong balance sheet, which, combined with record operating cash flow of $13.2 billion in fiscal '16, provides tremendous flexibility to make key investments to expand our existing businesses, capitalize on new growth opportunities and return capital to our shareholders.
Before I discuss our segment's fourth quarter results, I want to remind you that our Q4 results last year included the benefit of an additional week of operations compared to this year. This 53rd week in our fiscal 2015 calendar makes comparisons of our results a little challenging. While there is an element of imprecision in quantifying the impact, we are going to give you our best assessment of how the 53rd week affected key segments and drivers.
As we've previously discussed, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to our Q4 fiscal '15 results was approximately $350 million in operating income or about $0.13 in earnings per share with the majority of the impact at cable, followed by Parks and Resorts and to a lesser extent, Consumer Products. At Media Networks, we estimate the 53rd week had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about 12 percentage points. As a result, operating income was down 8% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by a decline at cable. The year-over-year change in cable operating income was weighed down in Q4 by about 14 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which adversely affected results at ESPN and Disney Channels and led to a 13% decline in cable operating income for the quarter.
Lower results at ESPN were driven by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to 3 factors: a significant decrease in daily Fantasy advertising, an additional week of ad revenue in Q4 last year and the impact of ad dollars being diverted to Olympics programming.
So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing down compared to last year, mostly reflecting the timing of key college football bowl games. This year, ESPN will air only 3 of the new year's 6 ballgames during our fiscal Q1, whereas all 6 games aired during the first fiscal quarter last year. Affiliate revenue was lower in the quarter as higher contractual rates were more than offset by the impact of the 53rd week and a decrease in subscribers.
Turning to Broadcasting. Operating income was higher in the quarter due to growth in affiliate revenue and higher operating income from program sales, partially offset by lower advertising, higher programming cost and an increase in equity losses. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by higher contractual rates. Higher program sales were driven by sales of Luke Cage and Quantico during the quarter.
Programming expenses were up in the quarter as a result of higher costs for network programming, the addition of the Emmy Awards and higher costs for political news coverage. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was adversely impacted by an estimated 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which was the primary driver of the 5% decline in ad revenue during the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 24% above upfront levels.
Turning to affiliate revenue. We estimate the 53rd week and FX had an 8 percentage point adverse impact to Media Networks' affiliate revenue growth, which was down 3% in the quarter. Growth in total cable affiliate revenue was adversely impacted by 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week and FX, which drove a 5% decline in the quarter. During Q4, we also saw solid growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, which once again was up double digits.
At Parks and Resorts, we estimate the 53rd week had a 12 percentage point adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income, which was down 5% in the fourth quarter.
Our underlying domestic business had another great quarter. We estimate the 53rd week created a 16 percentage point headwind to growth and operating income, yet growth in OI at our domestic operations was still up 2%. Operating margins at our domestic operations were up 120 basis points compared to Q4 last year despite an adverse impact of about 120 basis points due to the 53rd week.
Attendance at our domestic parks was down 10% in the quarter, reflecting the additional week of operations in Q4 last year. On a comparable fiscal period basis, attendance was down about 3% as higher attendance at Walt Disney World was more than offset by lower attendance at Disneyland, which was comping against a very strong attendance in Q4 2015 during the park's 60th anniversary celebration.
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1%, and occupancy was up over 2 percentage points to 86%.
While the underlying performance of our domestic business was quite strong in the quarter, operating income at our international operations was lower, driven by about a $100 million decline at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a positive contribution from a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort.
Disneyland Paris continued to experience softness in the quarter due to the lingering effect of terrorism and economic and political uncertainty. While we're disappointed with Disneyland Paris' results in the quarter, we expect to see near-term improvement in connection with the 25th anniversary celebration, which begins in spring 2017.
As Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operation were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year.
At the Studio, operating income was lower for the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year due to lower worldwide theatrical results, partially offset by higher operating income from television distribution. Lower theatrical results reflect the performance of Pete's Dragon and Queen of Katwe in the quarter compared to Ant-Man in Q4 last year as well as higher marketing spending for films yet to be released.
To put things in perspective, while Q4 results were lower compared to last year, our Studio had a phenomenal year with operating income up 37% to a record $2.7 billion.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, we estimate the 53rd week, which weighed on our licensing result, had an adverse impact on segment operating income of about 9 percentage points. As a result, segment operating income declined by 5% due to lower results in our licensing and games businesses. While we continued to see strong sales of Finding Dory merchandise in the fourth quarter, this was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q4 last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased about 16.6 million shares for $1.6 billion, and for the full year, we repurchased about 73.8 million shares for $7.5 billion. So far this quarter, we've repurchased 6.1 million shares for approximately $560 million, and we expect to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year.
As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver modest EPS growth for the year due to some comparability factors. Let's start with cable, where we expect fiscal '17 programming cost to be up about 8% versus fiscal '16, driven primarily by the first year of our new NBA contract, which accounts for $600 million of that increase.
Our Parks and Resorts segment is positioned for continued growth in 2017 due in part to the opening of Avatar Land at Walt Disney World and a full year of results from Shanghai Disney Resort.
There are 3 parks comparability items I'd like to mention: First, Hurricane Matthew disrupted our operations at Walt Disney World in early October, which resulted in the closure of our parks for about 1.5 days. We estimate the impact of the hurricane on Q1 operating income to be approximately $40 million.  
Second, due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the conversion of rooms at Wilderness Lodge to Vacation Club units, Q1 total domestic resort reservations are pacing down about 2%, while booked rates are pacing up 3%.
And third, I'd like to point out that 1 week of the winter holiday period will fall in Q2, whereas the entire holiday fell in Q1 last year. As a result, this will shift about $20 million of OI from Q1 into Q2.
Turning to the Studio. Bob discussed the strength of our slate in Q1, and it's worth mentioning, we will also release Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 during the year. While we remain thrilled with our Studio business and the great films we have in the pipeline, I'll remind everyone that results in fiscal '17 will comp against a record-breaking 2016 due in part to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while we expect operating income growth for the full year, we expect OI to be down more than 20% in the first quarter due to the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise licensing and our licensed Star Wars: Battlefront game in Q1 last year.
And finally, results in fiscal 2017 will be adversely impacted by about $175 million due to FX rates and higher pension expense. Also, in terms of net interest expense, the $100 million you saw in the fourth quarter represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for the year.
We're very pleased with our fiscal 2016 results, which once again demonstrate that our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content, coupled with great execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation, continues to generate solid earnings growth. Once again, we expect to deliver modest earnings growth in fiscal 2017, and as Bob said, we feel extremely confident that we'll return to more robust earnings growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A."

I mentioned in my comments the popularity, and there are certainly recent examples like the World Series of live sports. So I feel really good about their programming. I feel good about their continued ability to drive solid advertising. We have a good sense of what their rate structure is in terms of existing deals with distributors, but we have some opportunities and some new deals to improve the rate structure even more. We have taken a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's sub base. We think that while we were candid a few years -- a year ago in sub losses, we believe that, to some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages. But we also believe that new entrants in the marketplace, particularly DMVDs -- digital MVPDs, I should say, are going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people. And in particular, we think those offerings, because of their pricing, their user interface, their mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more millennials to either stay in the multi-channel ecosystem of subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past. So we just generally feel bullish about ESPN's future. We are, I'd say, realistic about what we've seen in -- with recent sub trends and again, have been, I think, fairly candid about that. And we think the long-term prospects for the reason I cited for ESPN are good. The other thing that ESPN has, which we've talked about a lot, is the ability to take product out direct to consumer, and that's why we invested in BAM. And we think that gives us a really interesting opportunity to create a new product. It gives us an interesting opportunity to create product that is more user friendly and therefore, is likely to gain more consumption, and it gives us an ability to mine data from that user consumption that can improve our advertising prospects and give us the ability to tailor the product more -- in a more customized way for those consumers."

Christine may want to address it a little bit from a financial perspective, but this has opened very successfully, very successfully. And I mentioned 2 things in my earlier comments: one, just the sheer number of people that have come in, but we also have a fair amount of data already about guest satisfaction. We know that consumers are staying longer. Obviously, that's the result of them liking it. And the other thing that's really interesting to us is what a national product this has become. We expected that attendance would be primarily from the Shanghai area at least in the early months and maybe a couple of years as word of mouth spread across the country. But the fact that 50% of attendance already is from outside of Shanghai tells us that this is a product that's resonating across China. And obviously, given the population base that China represents, that bodes very well for us. So the product is working. People are coming. They're staying longer. We like the trends that we're seeing generally about spending. Our hotel occupancy is extremely high. We didn't get into details there, but I can tell you that it's very, very high off the bat. We've already made a decision about expansion, and that's already begun. And so our outlook for this and what we even see happening in 2017 is quite positive."

And we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously, when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. But we believe that there are a number of tools we have available to us on the revenue yield management side to create more revenue out of the attendance that we're getting. We also have other kinds of expansion opportunities like hotels, for instance, where not only do we have the property, but when we've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California that we believe that it would be smart for us to build more hotels out. We have no announcements to make per se but build more hotels out at both sites and take advantage of what we're seeing there. That clearly is very beneficial to us. And then we've only just begun to mine some of the critical IP that we have created in the last few years, Star Wars being the biggest one. We're building 2 of the biggest lands we've ever built in Orlando and in California. And we think that -- I know you talked about what we've done already, but there's so much more that we can do and so much more we are doing. And I think, usually when we talk about the Studio, we talk about the Studio results as it relates to box office and the bottom line for that business, but you also have to think about it in terms of how we mine these assets not just in the United States but globally at our parks and in Consumer Products. I was in Shanghai last week, and it was just thrilling to see the reaction people are having to those franchises. Look, we had 11 franchises at Consumer Products last year that did $1 billion or more in global retail sales, but you really see that resonating when you go to the theme parks. And not just Mickey Mouse and core characters and pirates and things you'd expect but the line for characters from Zootopia in Shanghai was significant. So I think there -- and we're at a time in that product cycle that the ability to increase profitability from it is really just kicking in."

Let's use the parks as an example in what we're doing at Imagineering, where there's significant investment in new technology to improve the guest experience, both -- and that, by the way, includes how guests buy access to our parks, the whole online sale or e-commerce experience as a for instance. We're redoing disneystore.com using basically better technological tools, another example. BAM, clearly, was what I was mostly referring to because that is an investment in a technology platform aimed at strengthening our technology capabilities so that we can strengthen our business. On the parks question that you asked, we haven't seen a negative impact at Hong Kong due to Shanghai at all. In fact, there was some uptick initially on Hong Kong attendance when Shanghai opened, and it seems to be an interesting growth in pride locally in Hong Kong in that park. I guess their competitive spirits have somehow or another been stimulated. In terms of what we're seeing in Shanghai attendance wise and the makeup of the visitor weekday or post summer, it's really kind of too early to tell. I will say, having been there last week on 2 weekdays, I was surprised at how many kids were in the park. They were younger kids, but there were many more of them what we expected. And we are seeing some interesting patterns already with visitation. I cited one just in terms of where we're sourcing visitors geographically. I don't want to get into too many of the others yet because this -- we're only 4 months in. But the strength of certain days of the week that we didn't expect and some days of the week are slightly less strong than we thought initially. But so far, I can say so good, meaning we really are happy with how this product has launched. Another thing that I haven't really addressed here but one of the things that we wanted to be incredibly sensitive about and be really good at was the whole notion of entering a new market with this product under what I'll call culturally sensitive or culturally correct circumstances, opening something that the people of China actually -- that resonated with them in terms of their experience, and that has been letter-perfect."

And it's possible that given what's gone on this week, that that's likely to be addressed sooner rather than later. That's obviously a good thing. It's also a good thing, I think, for the market and for most businesses that the transition is already off to what appears to be fairly smooth start, meaning it looks like there's cordiality, which we have not seen in a long time, and there is an attempt by both sides, the incumbent and the President-elect, to approach this in a rational, cordial, I guess, the best way -- effective and polite way.

In all cases, we believe the user interface and the technology is going to be very contemporary and will be very mobile friendly. And we think given the pricing and the nature of the product that is coming out, that the opportunity to either keep millennials in as subscribers or to attract them, meaning cause them to subscribe earlier than they may have, is actually very encouraging. And that's one of the reasons why we're more bullish about the future of multi-channel TV than perhaps either the marketplace or others are. Doesn't mean there isn't going to be a shift either away from the giant expanded basic bundle or away from some of the traditional distributors, but we believe that there will be plenty of other opportunities. And the other thing that we have to note, which we've said before, is these new entrants in the marketplace are very, very interested in distributing our product. They know the popularity of sports, and in particular, ESPN, and they know that it is in their best interest to license that product to launch their service more effectively.

So Bob, on the subject of direct to consumer and getting closer to the consumer, I want to ask about Disney content as a direct-to-consumer service sort of outside of ESPN. So you have, in the U.K., I believe, DisneyLife, which you talked about -- you've talked about in the past. When do we see something like that, Disney as a service, so to speak, back in the U.S., so direct-to-consumer Disney-branded apps here Stateside? And then, Christine, just, you mentioned cable programming costs up 8% in fiscal '17. I was curious. Does that include the expectation for a step-up in the Big Ten costs for renewal there? I think that's up for renewal during the year. Correct me if I'm wrong."

Bob, you talked a little bit about the regulatory environment previously, but I'm curious specifically about your position on net neutrality. How important is the current policy to your business, both the existing business, also strategy, how you think about things going forward? And what -- how could that impact you if it were removed as policy? And then second, on the BAMTech partnership with Discovery in Europe, I'm curious, since ESPN seemed to move away from European exposure, why do you think Eurosport and Discovery can succeed where ESPN kind of pulled back?"

We think it's better because they were already in the market successfully, and we would be a new entrant with ESPN. And so this made sense for us. On the first part, we really haven't been vocal about net neutrality. I think it would be safe to say right now not even sure we have a strong, big oar in the water so to speak. And so we don't really have a public position to take on it. Frankly, it's not something that we -- that has even been discussed with me in the very recent past, so I'm caught mildly by surprise by it.
