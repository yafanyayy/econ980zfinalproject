I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning. 
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings presentation. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for today's call. We will start with an overview of Endo's consummation in 2015 and we'll move to review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, walking through our U.S. Branded, U.S. Generics and international businesses. We will then turn to our full year 2016 outlook and financial guidance. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. 
Moving on to Slide 4. 2015 was a year of transformative growth for Endo as we work towards our goal of improving lives while creating value. We made significant progress in our U.S. Branded pharmaceuticals business segment, completing the acquisition of Auxilium and revitalizing our product portfolio and R&D pipeline. We also secured FDA approval for BELBUCA and extended our Voltaren gel licensing agreement. In addition, we received a favorable IP rolling for OPANA ER and are continuing to advance that product with the recently submitted data package to the FDA that we feel could support an abused [indiscernible] formulation label expansion. The FDA has accepted the submission and set an action date of July 29, 2016. Collectively, these efforts and our continued execution across our full branded portfolio of products resulted in full year 4% underlying revenue growth for 2015.
Next, 2015 was a year of transformation and achieving critical mass for our U.S. Generics business. In September, we acquired Par Pharmaceuticals, expanding our portfolio with higher barrier to entry and alternative dosage products, tripling our R&D pipeline and creating a path for U.S. Generics company. After beginning full-scale integration in the fall, we've continued to optimize our generics business operations and product portfolio, ultimately driving 11% underlying revenue growth in 2015 in this segment. Our international segment was also rebased in 2015, positioning our emerging-market businesses strongly for growth in 2016 and beyond. For example, in our Litha business, we focused on [indiscernible] pharmaceuticals, acquiring a product at R&D portfolio from Aspen and divesting non-core aspects like devices and vaccines. Overall, we drove 6% underlying revenue growth in our international segment in 2015.
Finally, we continue to evolve in those corporate structure and strategy. We diversified our AMS business to further sharpen our focus on specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to build out and enhance our R&D infrastructure. We generated strong underlying cash flow from operations in line with expectations. In short, we have established a platform that, even if we pursue no additional M&A, positions us for future double-digit underlying growth and expanding margins. 2015 was indeed an important and transformative year in Endo's evolution. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see that evolution reflected in our solid financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Suky will provide more details about our results in just a few minutes. 
Next on Slide 6, let's talk about U.S. Branded pharmaceuticals. In 2015, our rebuilt brand portfolio drove underlying revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Key drivers of the growth included XIAFLEX, which continued to perform in line with our expectations. We have also officially launched BELBUCA and expect that product to be an important growth driver moving forward. The kickoff for this differentiated [indiscernible] 3 product took place at our national sales meeting earlier this month, and I can personally attest to the excitement and enthusiasm of our significantly expanded pain field force. All of us at Endo believe that this first and only currently approved buprenorphine bottle film for chronic pain offer an important new treatment option for patients. Also in December, we executed a new agreement to extend our commercialization for the market-leading Voltaren Gel through 2023 and secured rights to any future Authorized Generic for that product. 
Moving on to Slide 7 that's look at a snapshot of all XIAFLEX performed for the year. Well XIAFLEX U.S. revenues represented approximately 12% of our branded full year reported revenues and only 5% of overall Endo full year reported revenues, the product continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity and we are excited about the potential in its currently approved indications as well as in the R&D pipeline. Overall, XIAFLEX for Peyronie's Disease saw a strong 72% full year demand growth with vials [indiscernible] nearly 30,000 in 2015. We continue to expand our position base and are increasing our efforts to broaden clinical events. We believe that PD patient base can also expand. Our broad DPC campaigns including a comprehensive awareness program, which leverage spokesperson, Dr. Jerry [indiscernible] a long-time ESPN commentator and MD are formally kicking off next week. IN Dupuytren's contracture, we saw steady 12% full year demand growth in 2015, which is especially encouraging given that we are 5 years post launch. Our continuing efforts in this indication are focused on expanding the physician user base, educating patients about effective and nonsurgical option and with a multicore-enabled expansion building the average number of vials per patient over time.
Next let's talk about our U.S. Generics business on Slide 8. Overall, we were able to drive an underlying growth rate in the double digit for the full year despite increasing pricing pressures across the sector. We are very pleased with the strong contribution provided by the legacy Par business in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our international -- our internal expectations. The legacy Qualitest businesses, while diversified and historically insulated from the challenging pricing environment, did experience some volume loss and pricing pressure in the fourth quarter due to increased competition in multiplayer categories. While we have seen volume declines in some areas of this business, it is important to note that 80% of Qualitest's extended unit loss in the full year 2015 versus prior year was driven by only a handful of products that correspond to approximately 20% of Qualitest reported net sales in 2014. 
The fourth quarter also saw a more mild cold flu season that we believe contributed to lower-than-expected overall generic sales performance. As you will note, actual full year underlying generics growth was lower than prelminary estimates shared earlier this year. This was due to fourth quarter actual sales of our legacy Qualitest portfolio. Versus our preliminary expectations, the shortfall was driven by a number of nonrecurring net charges that were recorded as part of our year-end processes. While these types of customary charges -- while these types of charges are customary in any given quarter, we did see a higher level in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also, the shortfall was driven by a combination of higher-than-anticipated rebates and chargebacks that came through on fourth quarter sales identified during our year-end closed processes in January and February. These shortfalls were offset by better-than-expected results in our branded business bringing the total company performance in line with our 2015 preliminary expectations, once again highlighting the value of our diversified revenue mix. We will talk more about expectations for the generics pricing climate in 2016 and beyond when we discuss our full year guidance later in this call.
Next on Slide 9, you will see that 2015 was a year of rebasing for growth and increasing profitability for our International Pharmaceutical segment. Now that continues to be a steady high-margin contributor with recent launches providing potential upside for the business over time. In the fourth quarter, the impact of these launches were offset by the loss of exclusivity on select products, leading to some modest noncash impairments. Our [indiscernible] business continues to grow, driven by products across this broad portfolio. It was also a year of transformation for Litha with the Aspen portfolio acquisition and the divestiture of noncore product lines, which closed earlier this month. That business is now more sharply and strategically focused on higher-growth and higher-margin pharmaceutical products. I should note that similar to what we've seen across the sector and broader markets, a stronger U.S. dollar did impact our reported performance for the quarter and full year. 
On Slide 10, you will see our reported segment revenues continued to grow in 2015. 
Now for a more comprehensive look at our financial results, let me turn the call over to Suky. Suky?"
28071,325746146,943427,"Endo International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2016",2016-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. As Rajiv mentioned, the full year 2015 financial results were solid and characterized by diversified and profitable business.

As Rajiv mentioned, the full year 2015 financial results were solid and characterized by diversified and profitable business. On Slide 11, you will see that we achieved robust performance in 2015 with increased revenues, adjusted margins growing faster than revenue, progress on our tax planning strategies and adjusted earnings per share growth. 
Moving to Slide 12, let's take a more detailed look at our underlying cash flow from operations in 2015, which remained strong throughout the year. We view this as a quality measure of our overall results and our ability to deliver a long-term shareholder value. What you will see on this slide is that our 2015 reported cash flow from operations was impacted by a number of noncore cash outlays that are centered around product liabilities and nonrecurring costs related to M&A transaction completed in 2015. If you to neutralize these items, cash flow from operations have a high correlation to adjusted net income. We expect this profile to continue into 2016. As a note, you will see -- also see more information on our cash conversion cycle related to working capital in the appendix of today's slide presentation.
Next on Slide 13, we'd like to provide you more background around the mesh product liability accrual in the fourth quarter and how that is projected to impact future financial results. The environment around mesh product liability has evolved rapidly with an influx of claims having been presented to the company in late 2015. We believe these additional claims are primarily the result of increased advertising by plaintiff's attorneys, a lack of meaningful settlements by other mesh manufacturers and higher value verdicts awarded against other manufacturers. That said, we've taken the approach to strategically settle higher-value and quality case inventories with key plaintiff lawyer in certain individual cases. Also we plan to shift our strategy to vigorously defend and, if appropriate, litigate remaining cases and seek relief from the federal court in the ongoing mesh multidistrict litigation. I note that our approval is based on claims that are settled or are considered improbable and [indiscernible]. We currently are aware of approximately 8,000 purported claims that have not been accrued for, because based on the analysis by the company and outside legal counsel, we believe this portfolio could be of lower value and lower quality as almost all of the claims are lacking medical records and/Or basic demographic information. We've also recently become aware of what we believe may be fraudulent or other wrongful activities relating to the generation of certain mesh claims. While we do not yet know the scope of such activities we plan to fully investigate them and, if appropriate, will vigorously pursue all available remedies against each responsible party and cooperate with law enforcement authorities, other mesh manufacturers and the court.
Importantly, we have seen a rate of purported cases decrease substantially in the early part of 2016 as we continue to make progress in narrowing the mesh liability tale. We are also reducing the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants through our decision to shut down our [indiscernible] Women's Health business, which we announced earlier today. 
Now turning to the accrual. Our pretax product liability accruals as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, about $150 million was paid out in Qualified Settlement Funds or QSFs. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $834 million pretax charge to increase the estimated product liability accrual for mesh cases. Reflected in this increase as a conservative measure based on the lack of any meaningful reduction factor observed today, we have removed the reduction or kickout factor resulting in a $401 million impact. The total increase also reflects a $433 million impact primarily related to the execution of additional mesh or settlement agreements in 2016. It is important to note that we believe these recently settled cases represent a higher value and quality portfolio cases with a higher mix of explant surgeries or revisions and are not representative of overall settlement per case averages. At the end of the fourth quarter 2015, the amount funded in the QSF was $579 million. This brings us to a total remaining mesh liability, pretax cash call of approximately $1.5 billion. Our total remaining mesh liability post-tax cash call based on the current accrual is projected to be approximately $575 million through 2017 with about $150 million to $250 million paid in 2016 and approximately $325 million to $425 million paid in 2017. The overall pretax cash call is mitigated by an expected tax rate refund of approximately $700 million that is expected in the first half of 2016. With these post-tax cash call projections and a robust underlying cash generation, we have the confidence that we can continue to delever into the 3 to 4x range in the second half of 2016 and expect further delevering into 2017. 
Next, on Slide 14, let's talk briefly about the announcement we made this morning regarding ASTORA Women's Health business. As you know, we successfully divested the AMS Men's Health business and launched a strategic sale process for AMS Women's Health, now ASTORA Women's Health, in 2015. That process did result in formal base for ASTORA. However, Endo has now determined that the best strategy is to wind down ASTORA business operations. This decision was a difficult one as it impacts our dedicated employees, the physician community and, importantly, the patients for whom ASTORA products are important treatment options. Key factors that drove our decision include the evolving product liability landscape around vaginal mesh has been challenging and continues to evolve for all manufacturers including ASTORA. And second by shutting down the business as opposed to selling it, we're able to reduce the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants, which would not have been achievable in the event of a sale of the ASTORA business. So we will now work to support physician transition plans to alternate products. We expect to cease business operations for ASTORA by March 31, 2016. On other balance sheet matters, as noted in our press release, we took noncash impairment charges totaling approximately $140 million in the quarter. These charges are on a total goodwill and intangible balance of $15 billion as of December 31, 2015. The majority or about $86 million of the charges were related to Paladin and is driven by the loss of exclusivity of certain products. As we noted at Q3, we finalized our goodwill testing in Q4 and guided that there could be modest changes to impairments in the fourth quarter.
I would like to emphasize that 2015 was another year of transformation for Endo and one that positions us for future growth and profitability. Specifically, it was a year where we further diversified and expanded our revenue base. We delivered solid underlying growth in a challenging market. We expanded margins, improved our underlying after-tax cash flow conversion, we built a strong branded and generics product pipeline, we improved our operating model and execution and made continued progress on narrowing the tale of the company's mesh-related product liability. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv to discuss our key priorities and growth drivers for 2016. Rajiv?"

Let me first echo your comments about our dedicated ASTORA employees and management team and take a moment to thank them for their contributions and commitment to the business. We would also like to thank the physician community, which has been so supportive of ASTORA and its products. 
Now moving to Slide 16. As we enter 2016, we have set out a number of strategic and operational priorities. First, we are focused on value creation including a strong commercial launch of BELBUCA, continued growth of XIAFLEX in DC and PD and the seamless integration and continued growth for our generics business. Second, we are executing using our differentiated operating model. We are advancing our derisked R&D pipeline and moving key XIAFLEX programs into clinical trials this year, and we are continuing [indiscernible] R&D pipeline momentum and productivity. Third, Endo is achieving sustainable growth. As Suky mentioned, we expect to delever back down to the 3 to 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA range this year. And in our continuing efforts to diversify our revenue base, we expect to drive underlying growth in our emerging markets with our rebase [indiscernible] and Litha businesses. 
Next on Slide 17, we are very pleased to have launched BELBUCA last week. We believe BELBUCA is well differentiated as it combines Schedule 3 status, proven efficacy and established safety and tolerability profile  of buprenorphine with a novel delivery system that adds convenience and flexibility for patients. To support our accounts into the nearly $5 billion, long-acting opioid market, we've more than doubled our pain field force and have been working to ensure broad patient access. We believe BELBUCA is strongly positioned for growth and are projecting sales to be greater than $250 million in 2019, which, while significant, represents only a small proportion of the existing current market. 
Turning to Slide 18. You will see the scope and size of the chronic pain burden that we are looking to address with BELBUCA. More than 30% of all Americans or about 100 million people are suffering from chronic pain. This is more than diabetes, coronary heart disease and cancer combined. 
On Slide 19, let's discuss where we are positioning BELBUCA within the chronic pain treatment paradigm. We see a prime opportunity for BELBUCA to serve those patients who are transitioning from short-acting opioids to a long-acting opioid treatment. We also see potential for BELBUCA and its differentiated product profile to make an impact by capturing patient searching from other long-acting opioids or pursue a opiod-naïve and are going directly to a long-acting opioid product. In short, we believe the opportunity for BELBUCA is exciting and significant, and our early feedback from customers under launch has been very positive. 
Next on Slide 20, let's talk about our progress with XIAFLEX. XIAFLEX continues to perform in line with our internal growth expectations. We continue to aspire to be a $1 billion franchise around this molecule. We are projecting continued momentum into 2016 and double-digit growth for this product over our planning horizon. This growth will be fueled in part by our multipronged sales and marketing campaigns designed to increase physician and patient awareness. In terms of the R&D pipeline, XIAFLEX continues to exceed our internal and initial expectations and are continuing to move new programs into the clinic this year. 
Next on Slide 21, you will see the considerable market expansion opportunity for XIAFLEX. While it was launched more than 5 years ago and has seen steady growth and increasing traction over time, we believe there's a significant opportunity for us to grow market share for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture using our DPC campaigns and to continue building traction for the multi- [indiscernible] indication. in Peyronie's disease, we are seeking to expand the market through an unbranded disease awareness campaign. While a large number of diagnosed patients are currently untreated, XIAFLEX is showing very strong penetration amongst those patients that are treated. We believe that by continuing to capture those patient treatments and expanding the base of patients seeking a treatment option, we can continue the robust double-digit growth in this indication.
In summary, across our branded business in 2016, we expect to drive growth with BELBUCA, XIAFLEX and other products including our long-acting TRT portfolio with some offset by continued erosion in our legacy products. As a result, we project low single-digit underlying growth for this business. 
Moving to Slide 22. Our focus on value creation also includes our U.S. Generics business. This 2015 and 2016 breakout of our pro forma generics revenue illustrates key segments of our Par business as well as how those segments are growing. Most importantly, the segments that are growing substantially are also those that represent our highest value products. In fact, we project that in 2016, more than 40% of our generics revenues will come from revenues in our highest value and highest growth categories. First, new launches and alternative dosages will be a key growth driver this year as it includes the introduction of first-to-file products like the generic versions of Zetia and [indiscernible] XR, which we expect to bring to market at the end of 2016. This category also includes differentiated higher barrier to entry and higher-margin products like patches, powders, ophthalmics and other alternative dosages. 
Next sterile injectables have tripled in net sales since Par acquired JHP in 2014, and these products have high barriers to entry, high margins and strong competitive positioning and growth potential. We project significant continued double-digit growth with gross margins well above the company average for this segment in 2016. In summary, across our generics business in 2016, we project underlying growth in the mid to high teens. 
Moving to Slide 23. You will see that the effect of our collective efforts and our acquisition of Par in 2015 are not only increasing the size of our portfolio and generics pipeline but also growing revenue and improving our gross margins. We expect to meaningfully continue this expansion into 2016 and beyond.
Next on Slide 24, let's talk about our differentiated operating model, specifically, our derisked XIAFLEX R&D pipeline. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that we will initiate new clinical programs in this year. Beyond that, we see a broad range of potential aesthetic and therapeutic indications with significant unmet needs with large patients populations and market potential that we believe will drive the long-term value of XIAFLEX. 
Moving to Slide 25. Let me take a moment to provide you with an overview of our recently initiated Phase IIb clinical trial in cellulite. Cellulite affects nearly all women and there is little evidence that current treatments are an effective. 
Moving to Slide 26. Our differentiated operating model and derisked R&D approach also drives our generics activities. Par brought with its own industry strongest Paragraph IV first-to-file and first-to-market R&D capabilities. Those capabilities are fueling projected stream of potential high-value, high-margin product launches in 2016 to 2019 time frame. Specifically, we project more than 100 potential product launches over the horizon including 20 first-to-files. 
Next on Slide 27. Let's talk about our emerging market international business as another driver for sustainable growth. Overall, we expect our international business segments including Paladin in the more established Canadian markets will demonstrate a high single-digit underlying growth rate in 2016 driven by a emerging markets businesses. That said, we believe international reported revenues will decline in 2016 due to a stronger dollar versus 2015, increased generic competition for the Paladin portfolio and divestitures of low margin device and vaccine products from the [indiscernible] portfolio. However, importantly, we expect that our 2016 operating income from this business segment will be line with 2015 due to our successful rebasing of our emerging markets businesses.
You will see here the expected impact of this rebasing on [indiscernible] and Litha revenues and operating margins in 2016. We expect a significantly improved margin profile in international segments and low double-digit underlying growth across SOMAR and Litha this year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Suky to talk about our full financial guidance for 2016. Suky?"
28071,325746146,943427,"Endo International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2016",2016-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products i",648,"Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM AG, FROVA, Valganciclovir and low-dose hydrocodone APAP. Second, while our diversified portfolio insulated us for most of 2015, as Rajiv mentioned, we do expect pricing headwinds in U.S. Generics to continue across the sector and for there to be a more challenging pricing environment for commoditized products. And third, we assume current exchange rates for foreign currency conversions. 
So on Slide 30, you will see the highlights of our full year 2016 financial guidance are as follows. We expect total net revenues to be in the range of $4.32 billion to $4.52 billion. We project adjusted gross margins of 63% to 65% this year which is in line with 2015 despite a higher mix of generics revenue in 2016. This is primarily driven by the continued growth of XIAFLEX, the launch of BELBUCA and our continued shift towards high-value products in our generics business. Each of our segments is expected to maintain or improve their gross margin profile in 2016 versus 2015. Despite increases in branded promotional spending across XIAFLEX and BELBUCA and higher R&D expenses to support the branded and generics pipeline, total expenses are growing below the rate of sales as we leverage G&A and capture the full synergies for the Par transaction. This translates into a projected adjusted operating expense to revenue ratio of 19.5% to 20%, which is more than 150 basis point improvement versus 2015. Under these assumptions, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-40s, which is better than our 2015 EBITDA margin profile. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be approximately $455 million. This estimate includes approximately $34 million of the amortization of deferred financing fees in 2016 and also assumes debt paydown of about $500 million in 2016 versus ending gross debt balances in 2015. 
Given our continued progress on building out our infrastructure in Dublin, leveraging deal attributes and executing on our tax strategy, as observed through 2015, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year 2016. These moving parts translate to an adjusted diluted earnings per share range of $5.85 to $6.20 with approximately 224 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
As expected, our results will be lumpy through the year, driven by a number of factors including the early investment and corresponding ramp of BELBUCA, the timing of potential market events around key products in the branded and generics portfolio that Rajiv mentioned earlier, the cyclical nature of some of our businesses including fluctuations and stocking levels and the anticipated launch of our generic versions of Seroquel XR and Zetia in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 54% of revenues and about 57% of EPS to be in the second half of 2016. This weighting is heavily influenced with the expected timing of the Zetia and SEROQUEL launches. Again, using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 22% of revenues and 18% of EPS to be in the first quarter of 2016. This is driven by normal cyclical trends and destocking the we historically see in the first quarter. Also, investment for BELBUCA in the first quarter more than offset revenues for that product as we will book revenues based on demand until we see a normalized pattern of shipments versus demand trends. 
So in summary, we believe that 2016 financial profile will be a continuation of 2015, which was marked by solid underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, an attractive tax rate and strong underlying cash flow conversion.

We did start to see the early signs of some volume erosion in our more commoditized parts of our business. And then as we closed out our final processes for the year, we did recognize higher level of chargebacks and rebate coming through, specifically around our more commoditized portfolio as well as our pain franchise. That in tandem with one-time charges that occurred in the fourth quarter led to a lower-than-expected fourth quarter. I should say that those one-time charges we do not expect to continue in forward-looking quarterly results, but there is some underlying pressure around pricing that will extend in 2016. Having said that, all of that is baked into our forward-looking estimates for 2016. And as Rajiv noted earlier in the scripted remarks, we've seen very strong generics growth in the midteens to high teens, primarily driven by the injectables business, continued growth across the base as well as our launches on the certain products. 
Paul, if you want to add anything more on the price erosion please."

Our focus is clearly on our pipeline. It's all on execution. Rajiv touched on it in his opening comments that this year is going to be a year of execution.

Our initial expectation going into 2016 was with a higher mix generics products versus branded. We might see some dilution into our gross margin. As we actually work through our plan and our portfolio prioritization, we're actually moving to a higher mix of a higher value products, which is ultimately expanding our margins. So as Paul talked about or as Rajiv talked about in his scripted remarks, the growth of the injectable franchise is one that is characterized for the gross margin profile well above the overall company average as we think about the launches of some of our day certain products. Those are also products that have gross margin profiles well ahead of the overall gross margin average. And than when you add in continued growth of XIAFLEX as well as BELBUCA, both of which have gross margin profiles above the company average, you start to form a picture where we're going to see this gross margin expansion into 2016 and one that we're very pleased and confident in. And then from an operating margin perspective, as I said, we're going to spend more against advertising and promoting -- promotion against XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are going to spend more this year around R&D for generics and for branded, full stop. However, we are getting operating leverage through G&A as well as through the full realization of the Par synergies sometime in mid-2016. So not only do we get all operating margin expansion -- gross margin expansion, we're going to see operating margin expansion as well and also on top of a very favorable tax rate."

But as we talked about in the past, those are also partner products, right? So as you look at all the entire horizon, you will have many, many more launches, most of which are not partnered where the bottom line equates entirely to Endo, right? So from that standpoint, we do see new launches being the primary driver of growth business in '16 as well as into the future. I would also say that the injectables business has been a great performer for Par. It's tripled in size JHP was acquired by Par and we expect to see the momentum continue in '16 as well as beyond.

Those are hard to develop products, hard to partner products and we're very proud of that relationship. That said, we have about 20 products that we should be launching in 2016, albeit maybe not major, major drivers. But in the generic industry, and you never actually know what product can outperform, and some example, when we look at what we achieved in 2015 that are carrying us into 2016, we had a handful of carryover products like [indiscernible] and these are relatively smaller type products that ultimately have limited competition. They're going to carry us into the first part of 2016. Again, hard to make. But from a brand sales standpoint, maybe not at the largest products but good drivers. When we look a little bit at the  [indiscernible] portfolio, we are real proud of what we have in Rochester. I think it's a great time to have sterile facility in U.S. soil. It continues to be a barrier to entry. Products like Vasostrict tests continue to outperform, and that's on the branded site. But additionally, we have a handful of generic products that have had limited competition, products like [indiscernible] and ethacrynic acid. These are all products that have been genericized but limited competition. And again these factored in with some of our overlap and carryover products from last year should give us a good basis for 2016."

That being said, what I would say is that we have come a long way. And although the environment has continued to be more challenging than we have initial settlements, which by the way, I'm glad we did, but the reality is that the rest of industry at that time didn't follow with additional settlements as we would have expected and there was increased advertising, which has kind of led to this additional [indiscernible] of claims in the back end of 2015. Now as we look at what we have done here though, I do feel good that the current settlement that we just announced this morning are ones that are focused on the high-value claims. And effectively, what is left is what we believe to be a much lower value set of portfolio cases, many of them could be serious. And in addition, this is -- there is an evidence of potential fraud amongst some of these cases as well. So as we look at what remains, we do think it is a portfolio we can be a lot more aggressive in terms of how we approach it, either in terms of taking some cases into trial as well as potentially through an investigation fraud seeking to dismiss some incompetence of [indiscernible]. And also keep in mind we have now put a significant time between us and the public health notice that the FDA should in 2011. That again should also be factored that drives to reduce the number of revenue cases. And then finally, our decision to shut down the ASTORA business also will contribute to reducing potential for future liability. So I think as we stand here today, we do feel good about where we've taken the mesh liability despite the additional increment that you saw in 2015. We do expect to resolve the remainder of it over the course of the next couple of years and then there's no guarantee that an accrual may or may not change. But I would say is that we are confident given what we know now about where we have a broader situation. And then fundamentally we're a different company now, right? And so we have on an adjusted basis more than $2.5 billion or roughly around $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, which allows us the ability to manage this over time it makes it a lot more manageable call on our cash."

So good morning. So relative to your question on how it impacts cash flow, so as we pointed out in the slides, at the end of fourth quarter, we got a pretax remaining cash call of about $1.5 billion after we make these additional accruals. So again, pretax remaining cash call of $1.5 billion. We expect in 2016 to pay somewhere around $850 million to $900 million of that $1.5 billion on a pretax basis. But after you consider the tax refund that we'll be getting as far part of our restructuring of the AMS sale, our post tax obligation for mesh in 2016 will be somewhere between $150 million to $250 million, so quite manageable in the backdrop of $2 billion plus EBITDA in 2016. As we move to 2017, as we put in the slide, we expect the post-tax cash call there for the residual of that liability that I talked about to be somewhere between 350 and 450, and again that is going to be in the base of EBITDA from 2016 of $2 billion-plus to one that's growing double digits into 2017, so again, very manageable cash call in the backdrop of very robust underlying cash flow generation."

We treat this as one business and that's how we'll report on it. The charges in the fourth quarter were about $30 million that we consider to be one-time and nonrecurring. It's really 3 factors that make this up. Well, there's a number of factors, 3 of which are examples are around trade disputes in the fourth quarter. We have some changes in estimates around gross connects. And third, we have some charges higher-than-expected around the harmonization of our methodologies around gross connects as we integrated Par and Qualitest.

So that is firstly the biggest driver of growth. It's all about volume and launches of those products.

As I think about the next 12 months and the evolution of the company, is this just a fundamentally different environment from an M&A perspective where we're not going to see big deal that are much less likely?

That being said, it's early days from a managed care contracting standpoint. It's also early days in terms of the actual launch of the product. And also as we have indicated before, while every [indiscernible] in this product, which is why we put out an aspirational number for 2019 of $250 million, we do expect the ramp to be somewhat gradual in the first 12 months, and that is reflecting unknown. For instance, this is a different format of [indiscernible] patch, which while there are many advantages, patients and physicians need to get used to it. For those patients that are on other LAOs that are being transitioned to BELBUCA that needs to be down titration and up titration, so these things will take time for physicians to get used to. And also, as you well know from a market access standpoint, while commercial covered lives you can contract early in the launch, when it comes to Medicaid Part D coverage, which is roughly about 1/3 of the coverage in this market, and that usually waits for a full cycle. So we certainly would look to 2017 to have a much more substantial ramp than in 2016. But all the early signs are well within our expectations of what we expect to see for the product."

For us as you pointed out, 2015 was a very, very transformational year in terms of transaction. So in particular, we concluded Auxilium, the Par transaction and at a small level Aspen transaction in South Africa, which essentially gave us new platforms, right, and a sense of critical mass, particularly in our generics business. In many ways, we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, which is to get a set of assets, which even if we do no further M&A gives us a part double-digit growth. And then you couple that with the market environment where the debt markets will be [indiscernible] equity markets. But for as leaving the market conditions aside, 2016 really is about execution, which is why we've talked so much about BELBUCA, about XIAFLEX, the Par integration, those are the things that are going to make us successful. So from that perspective, M&A is not a key priority for us in 2016. I have said in the Par, we said we will continue to monitor opportunities. But really strictly, I think the [indiscernible] opportunities that make sense for us in 2016 will be the small in-licensing or product acquisition here or there either for our branded business or international, but we're talking -- we have a very small call on our cash for doing those types of things and the opportunity come across them. In terms of larger transactions, it is not in the anticipation to look for larger acquisitions in 2016. I have, however, said that even if there are -- if there is a larger merger, which could be value-creating that is done on the basis of a relative value of 2 companies and those are the types of things that we certainly will evaluate if they come our way. But certainly, it is not high on our list of priorities in terms of acquisitions as we look out over '16. Now back to your question about the nature of what's going on in the industry, I would say certainly the debt markets and equity markets have led to somewhat of a pause. But overall, if we look over the last 20, 30 years, this is a still highly fragmented industry. There are lots of -- it's a been a deal-rich industry for a long period of time. Obviously, those deals are cyclical and my suspicion is that deals will continue to be an important part of this industry as we look forward. But 2016 is certainly likely to be -- to see a pause at least from our perspective."

We had I think double-digit prescription volume growth, and that was the driver of V Gel for the year. In the LIDODERM, I think we've been successful in holdings some of our contracts through '15 probably better than we had expected on the branded LIDODERM. But as we enter into '16, we do expect to see some drop-off of those contracts that we would never be seen when we see our 2016 results, but it's already factored into our guidance. 2017 Marc, we're not going to comment on 2017. Clearly, we made that commentary against the backdrop of the Par transaction. First of all, I'm delighted to say what we committed to the outside world when we did the Par transaction, which was an accretion number for 2016, that is going out in our guidance as well as the implied multiple that we put out there for the Par transaction, which was 10 to 11x for synergy EBITDA multiple that is also following through in the 2016 numbers. As you said, there are lots of other puts and takes in our business. Certainly, V Gel is one. We are very excited about the extension of the agreement. There's always the possibility and potential of generic on V Gel, which we also have to keep in mind, which it somewhat offset a new agreement with the [indiscernible] that we have the right to [indiscernible] Authorized Generic and a lot of 2017 will also depend on how we're doing on BELBUCA and XIAFLEX. So we are very optimistic as we look at the '16 and beyond time horizon for Endo. That being said, we're not going to provide any specific further guidance on '17. On the generics question, I'll start and I'll bounce it to Paul. I think what I would say is if you separate the commodity -- the traditional commodity products from the pain products, and as you pointed out pain has been a traditional area of strength to us, we have -- we've often taken the approach of focusing on value versus pure volume on the pain business, right? So although we've taken some substantial volume declines in our pain portfolio, they are somewhat anticipated based on the price increases we took and, of course, we've taken. So net-net from a value standpoint, we're actually pleased with how the pain portfolio has performed. But is there a pricing pressure in pain as well as the commodity portfolio? The answer is yes because there are smaller players who tend to be aggressive even in the pain arena now, more so than they have been in the past. I don't know Paul if you have any comments."

It's relative to what we've -- how we've always characterized our branded pricing strategy, which is that we take appropriate prices, price increases. They typically range from the low single digit -- actually 0 in certain cases to potentially up to 20%, 25%. The high end of that range is typically for our mature products that already have multiple generics on the market. Our portfolio is generally contracted, which means that our price increases are capped. So even if we are taking price increases are higher, that means mid-single-digit, the realized price increases for us in our branded business is somewhere in the low to mid-single digits.

But to give you some of the moving parts for next year to help model, if you started with the midpoint of our revenue range and assume the mid-40s EBITDA margin, you get roughly into the $2 billion, $2 plus billion EBITDA range, from there, your movements on cash, you got interest expense, which we've talked about, you've got cash taxes in the mid-single digits on the underlying business. You've got a mesh post tax cash call of about $150 million to $250 million as we've talked about. Working capital on a day sales basis is going to be relatively steady throughout the year. However, because of the fourth quarter launches of Seroquel and Zetia, we do expect there to be a call on cash in the fourth quarter of somewhere between $200 million to $300 million. That will normalize in the first quarter of '17 as that launch pulls through. We have CapEx of about $150 million and contingent consideration of about $150 million. So if you put all those pieces together, that should get you pretty close to where we see our cash flow for the year."

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning. 
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings presentation. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for today's call. We will start with an overview of Endo's transformation in 2015, and we'll move to review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, walking through our U.S. Branded, U.S. Generics and international businesses. We will then turn to our full year 2016 outlook and financial guidance. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. 
Moving on to Slide 4. 2015 was a year of transformative growth for Endo, as we worked towards our goal of improving lives while creating value. We made significant progress in our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business segment, completing the acquisition of Auxilium and revitalizing our product portfolio and R&D pipeline. We also secured FDA approval for BELBUCA and extended our Voltaren Gel licensing agreement. In addition, we received a favorable IP ruling for OPANA ER and are continuing to advance that product with the recently submitted data package to the FDA that we feel could support an abuse deterrent formulation label expansion. The FDA has accepted that submission and set an action date of July 29, 2016. Collectively, these efforts and our continued execution across our full branded portfolio of products resulted in full year 4% underlying revenue growth for 2015.
Next, 2015 was a year of transformation and achieving critical mass for our U.S. Generics business. In September, we acquired Par Pharmaceutical, expanding our portfolio with higher barrier to entry and alternative dosage products, tripling our R&D pipeline and creating a top 4 U.S. Generics company. After beginning full-scale integration in the fall, we've continued to optimize our generics business operations and product portfolio, ultimately driving 11% underlying revenue growth in 2015 in this segment. Our international segment was also rebased in 2015, positioning our emerging-market businesses strongly for growth in 2016 and beyond. For example, in our Litha business, we focused on core pharmaceuticals, acquiring a product and R&D portfolio from Aspen and divesting noncore assets like devices and vaccines. Overall, we drove 6% underlying revenue growth in our international segment in 2015.
Finally, we continue to evolve in those corporate structure and strategy. We divested our AMS Men's health business to further sharpen our focus on specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to build out and enhance our Irish infrastructure. We generated strong underlying cash flow from operations, in line with expectations. In short, we have established a platform that, even if we pursue no additional M&A, positions us for future double-digit underlying growth and expanding margins. 2015 was indeed an important and transformative year in Endo's evolution. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see that evolution reflected in our solid financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Suky will provide more details about our results in just a few minutes. 
Next on Slide 6, let's talk about U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals. In 2015, our rebuilt branded portfolio drove underlying revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Key drivers of that growth included XIAFLEX, which continued to perform in line with our expectations. We have also officially launched BELBUCA and expect that product to be an important growth driver moving forward. The kickoff for this differentiated Schedule III product took place at our national sales meeting earlier this month, and I can personally attest to the excitement and enthusiasm of our significantly expanded pain field force. All of us at Endo believe that this first and only currently approved buprenorphine buccal film for chronic pain does offer an important new treatment option for patients. Also in December, we executed a new agreement to extend our commercialization for the market-leading Voltaren Gel through 2023 and secured rights to any future Authorized Generic for that product. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Let's look at a snapshot of how XIAFLEX performed for the year. While XIAFLEX U.S. revenues represent approximately 12% of our branded full year reported revenues and only 5% of overall Endo full year reported revenues, the product continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity, and we are excited about the potential in its currently approved indications as well as in the R&D pipeline. Overall, XIAFLEX for Peyronie's disease saw a strong 72% full year demand growth with vials totaling nearly 30,000 in 2015. We continue to expand our physician base and are increasing our efforts to broaden clinical awareness. We believe that PD, patient base can also expand. Our broad DTC campaigns, including a comprehensive disease awareness program with celebrity spokesperson, Dr. Jerry Punch, a long-time ESPN commentator and MD, are formally kicking off next week. In Dupuytren's contracture, we saw a steady 12% full year demand growth in 2015, which is especially encouraging given that we are 5 years post launch. Our continuing efforts in this indication are focused on expanding the physician user base, educating patients about an effective nonsurgical option and with the multi-cord label expansion building the average number of vials per patient over time.
Next, let's talk about our U.S. Generics business on Slide 8. Overall, we were able to drive an underlying growth rate in the double digits for the full year despite increasing pricing pressures across the sector. We are very pleased with the strong contribution provided by the legacy Par business in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our international -- our internal expectations. The legacy Qualitest businesses, while diversified and historically insulated from the challenging pricing environment, did experience some volume loss and pricing pressure in the fourth quarter due to increased competition in multi-player categories. While we have seen volume declines in some areas of this business, it is important to note that 80% of Qualitest's extended unit loss in the full year 2015 versus prior year was driven by only a handful of products that correspond to approximately 20% of Qualitest reported net sales in 2014. 
The fourth quarter also saw a more mild cold flu season, that we believe contributed to lower-than-expected overall generic sales performance. As you will note, actual full year underlying generics growth was lower than preliminary estimates shared earlier this year. This was due to fourth quarter actual sales of our legacy Qualitest portfolio. Versus our preliminary expectations, part of the shortfall was driven by a number of nonrecurring net charges that were recorded as part of our year-end processes. While these types of customary charges -- while these types of charges are customary in any given quarter, we did see a higher level in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also the shortfall was driven by a combination of higher-than-anticipated rebates and chargebacks that came through on fourth quarter sales identified during our year-end closed processes in January and February. These shortfalls were offset by better-than-expected results in our branded business bringing the total company performance in line with our 2015 preliminary expectations, once again highlighting the value of our diversified revenue mix. We will talk more about our expectations for the generics pricing climate in 2016 and beyond when we discuss our full year guidance later in this call.
Next on Slide 9, you will see that 2015 was a year of rebasing for growth and increasing profitability for our International Pharmaceutical segment. Paladin continues to be a steady high-margin contributor with recent launches providing potential upside for the business over time. In the fourth quarter, the impact of these launches were offset by the loss of exclusivity on select products, leading to some modest noncash impairments. Our Somar business continues to grow, driven by products across this broad portfolio. It was also a year of transformation for Litha with the Aspen portfolio acquisition and our divestiture of noncore product lines, which closed earlier this month. That business is now more sharply and strategically focused on higher-growth and higher-margin pharmaceutical products. I should note that similar to what we've seen across the sector and broader markets, a stronger U.S. dollar did impact our reported performance for the quarter and full year. 
On Slide 10, you will see our reported segment revenues continued to grow in 2015. 
Now for a more comprehensive look at our financial results, let me turn the call over to Suky. Suky?"

As Rajiv mentioned, the full year 2015 financial results were solid and characterized by a diversified and profitable business. On Slide 11, you will see that we achieved robust performance in 2015 with increased revenues, adjusted margins growing faster than revenue, progress on our tax planning strategies and adjusted earnings per share growth. 
Moving to Slide 12. Let's take a more detailed look at our underlying cash flow from operations in 2015, which remained strong throughout the year. We view this as a quality measure of our overall results and our ability to deliver a long-term shareholder value. What you will see on this slide is that our 2015 reported cash flow from operations was impacted by a number of noncore cash outlays that are centered around product liabilities and nonrecurring costs related to M&A transactions completed in 2015. If you neutralize these items, cash flow from operations have a high correlation to adjusted net income. We expect this profile to continue into 2016. As a note, you will see -- also see more information on our cash conversion cycle related to working capital in the appendix of today's slide presentation.
Next on Slide 13, we would like to provide you more background around the mesh product liability accrual in the fourth quarter and how that is projected to impact future financial results. The environment around mesh product liability has evolved rapidly with an influx of claims having been presented to the company in late 2015. We believe these additional claims are primarily the result of increased advertising by plaintiff's attorneys, a lack of meaningful settlements by other mesh manufacturers and higher value verdicts awarded against other manufacturers. That said, we've taken the approach to strategically settle higher-value and quality case inventories with key plaintiff's lawyers in certain individual cases. Also we plan to shift our strategy to vigorously defend and, if appropriate, litigate remaining cases and seek relief from the federal court in the ongoing mesh multi-district litigation. I note that our accrual is based on claims that are settled or are considered probable an estimate. We currently are aware of approximately 8,000 purported claims that have not been accrued for, because based on the analysis by the company and outside legal counsel, we believe this portfolio could be of lower value and lower quality as almost all of the claims are lacking medical records and/or basic demographic information. We've also recently become aware of what we believe may be fraudulent or other wrongful activities relating to the generation of certain mesh claims. While we do not yet know the scope of such activities, we plan to fully investigate them and, if appropriate, will vigorously pursue all available remedies against each responsible party and cooperate with law enforcement authorities, other mesh manufacturers and the court.
Importantly, we have seen the rate of purported cases decrease substantially in the early part of 2016, as we continue to make progress in narrowing the mesh liability tail. We are also reducing the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants through our decision to shut down our ASTORA Women's Health business, which we announced earlier today. 
Now turning to the accrual. Our pretax product liability accrual as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, about $150 million was paid out in Qualified Settlement Funds or QSFs. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $834 million pretax charge to increase the estimated product liability accrual for mesh cases. Reflected in this increase as a conservative measure based on the lack of any meaningful reduction factor observed to date, we have removed the reduction or kick-out factor, resulting in a $401 million impact. Total increase also reflects a $433 million impact, primarily related to the execution of additional mesh or settlement agreements in 2016. It is important to note that we believe these recently settled cases represent a higher value and quality portfolio cases with a higher mix of explant surgeries or revisions and are not representative of overall settlement per case averages. At the end of the fourth quarter 2015, the amount funded in the QSF was $579 million. This brings us to a total remaining mesh liability, pretax cash call of approximately $1.5 billion. Our total remaining mesh liability post-tax cash call based on the current accrual is projected to be approximately $575 million through 2017 with about $150 million to $250 million paid in 2016 and approximately $325 million to $425 million paid in 2017. The overall pretax cash call is mitigated by an expected tax refund of approximately $700 million that is expected in the first half of 2016. With these post-tax cash call projections and a robust underlying cash generation, we have the confidence that we can continue to delever into the 3 to 4x range in the second half of 2016 and expect further delevering into 2017. 
Next, on Slide 14, let's talk briefly about the announcement we made this morning regarding ASTORA Women's Health business. As you know, we successfully divested the AMS Men's Health business and launched a strategic sale process for AMS Women's Health, now ASTORA Women's Health, in 2015. That process did result in formal base for ASTORA. However, Endo has now determined that the best strategy is to wind down ASTORA business operations. This decision was a difficult one as it impacts our dedicated employees, the physician community and importantly, the patients for whom ASTORA products are important treatment options. Key factors that drove our decision include the evolving product liability landscape around vaginal mesh has been challenging and continues to evolve for all manufacturers, including ASTORA. And second, by shutting down the business as opposed to selling it, we're able to reduce the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants, which would not have been achievable in the event of a sale of the ASTORA business. So we will now work to support physician transition plans to alternate products. We expect to cease business operations for ASTORA by March 31, 2016. On other balance sheet matters, as noted in our press release, we took noncash impairment charges totaling approximately $140 million in the quarter. These charges are on a total goodwill and intangible balance of $15 billion as of December 31, 2015. The majority or about $86 million of the charges were related to Paladin and is driven by the loss of exclusivity of certain products. As we noted at Q3, we finalized our goodwill testing in Q4 and guided that there could be modest changes to impairments in the fourth quarter.
I would like to emphasize that 2015 was another year of transformation for Endo, and one that positions us for future growth and profitability. Specifically, it was a year where we further diversified and expanded our revenue base. We delivered solid underlying growth in a challenging market. We expanded margins, improved our underlying after-tax cash flow conversion, we built a strong branded and generics product pipeline, we improved our operating model and execution and made continued progress on narrowing the tail of the company's mesh-related product liability. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv to discuss our key priorities and growth drivers for 2016. Rajiv?"

Let me first echo your comments about our dedicated ASTORA employees and management team and take a moment to thank them for their contributions and commitment to the business. We would also like to thank the physician community, which has been so supportive of ASTORA and its products. 
Now moving to Slide 16. As we enter 2016, we have set out a number of strategic and operational priorities. First, we are focused on value creation, including a strong commercial launch of BELBUCA, continued growth of XIAFLEX in DC and PD and the seamless integration and continued growth for our generics business. Second, we are executing using our differentiated operating model. We are advancing our derisked R&D pipeline and moving key XIAFLEX programs into clinical trials this year, and we are continuing to pause R&D pipeline momentum and productivity. Third, Endo is achieving sustainable growth. As Suky mentioned, we expect to delever back down to the 3 to 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA range this year. And in our continuing efforts to diversify our revenue base, we expect to drive underlying growth in our emerging markets with our rebased Somar and Litha businesses. 
Next on Slide 17, we are very pleased to have launched BELBUCA last week. We believe BELBUCA is well differentiated as it combines Schedule III status, proven efficacy and established safety and tolerability profile of buprenorphine with a novel delivery system that adds convenience and flexibility for patients. To support our accounts into the nearly $5 billion, long-acting opioid market, we've more than doubled our pain field force and have been working to ensure broad patient access. We believe BELBUCA is strongly positioned for growth and are projecting sales to be greater than $250 million in 2019, which, while significant, represents only a small proportion of the existing current market. 
Turning to Slide 18. You will see the scope and size of the chronic pain burden that we are looking to address with BELBUCA. More than 30% of all Americans or about 100 million people are suffering from chronic pain. This is more than diabetes, coronary heart disease and cancer combined. 
On Slide 19, let's discuss where we are positioning BELBUCA within the chronic pain treatment paradigm. We see a prime opportunity for BELBUCA to serve those patients who are transitioning from short-acting opioids to a long-acting opioid treatment. We also see potential for BELBUCA and its differentiated product profile to make an impact by capturing patient searching from other long-acting opioids or those who are opioid-naive and are going directly to a long-acting opioid product. In short, we believe the opportunity for BELBUCA is exciting and significant, and our early feedback from customers on the launch has been very positive. 
Next on Slide 20, let's talk about our progress with XIAFLEX. XIAFLEX continues to perform in line with our internal growth expectations. We continue to aspire to build a $1 billion franchise around this molecule. We are projecting continued momentum into 2016 and double-digit growth for this product over our planning horizon. This growth will be fueled in part by our multi-pronged sales and marketing campaigns designed to increase physician and patient awareness. In terms of the R&D pipeline, XIAFLEX continues to exceed our internal -- initial expectations and are continuing to move new programs into the clinic this year. 
Next on Slide 21, you will see the considerable market expansion opportunity for XIAFLEX. While it was launched more than 5 years ago and has seen steady growth and increasing traction over time, we believe there's a significant opportunity for us to grow market share for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture using our DPC campaigns and to continue building traction for the multi-cord indication. In Peyronie's disease, we are seeking to expand the market through an unbranded disease awareness campaign. While a large number of diagnosed patients are currently untreated, XIAFLEX is showing very strong penetration amongst those patients that are treated. We believe that by continuing to capture those patient treatments and expanding the base of patients seeking a treatment option, we can continue the robust double-digit growth in this indication.
In summary, across our branded business in 2016, we expect to drive growth with BELBUCA, XIAFLEX and other products, including our long-acting TRT portfolio with some offset by continued erosion in our legacy products. As a result, we project low single-digit underlying growth for this business. 
Moving to Slide 22. Our focus on value creation also includes our U.S. Generics business. This 2015 and 2016 breakout of our pro forma generics revenue illustrates key segments of our Par business as well as how those segments are growing. Most importantly, the segments that are growing substantially are also those that represent our highest value products. In fact, we project that in 2016, more than 40% of our generics revenues will come from revenues in our highest value and highest growth categories. First, new launches and alternative dosages will be a key growth driver this year as it includes the introduction of first-to-file products like the generic versions of Zetia and Seroquel XR, which we expect to bring to market at the end of 2016. This category also includes differentiated higher barrier to entry and higher-margin products like patches, powders, ophthalmics and other alternative dosages. 
Next, sterile injectables have tripled in net sales since Par acquired JHP in 2014, and these products have high barriers to entry, high margins and strong competitive positioning and growth potential. We project significant continued double-digit growth with gross margins well above the company average for this segment in 2016. In summary, across our generics business in 2016, we project underlying growth in the mid to high teens. 
Moving to Slide 23. You will see that the effect of our collective efforts and our acquisition of Par in 2015 are not only increasing the size of our portfolio and generics pipeline, but also growing revenue and improving our gross margins. We expect to meaningfully continue this expansion into 2016 and beyond.
Next on Slide 24. Let's talk about our differentiated operating model, specifically our derisked XIAFLEX R&D pipeline. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that we will initiate new clinical programs this year. Beyond that, we see a broad range of potential aesthetic and therapeutic indications with significant unmet needs with large patient populations and market potentials that we believe will drive the long-term value of XIAFLEX. 
Moving to Slide 25. Let me take a moment to provide you with an overview of our recently initiated Phase IIb clinical trial in Cellulite. Cellulite affects nearly all women and there is little evidence that current treatments are effective. 
Moving to Slide 26. Our differentiated operating model and derisked R&D approach also drives our generics activities. Par brought with its own the industry's strongest Paragraph IV first-to-file and first-to-market R&D capabilities. Those capabilities are fueling a projected stream of potential high-value, high-margin product launches in 2016 to 2019 time frame. Specifically, we project more than 100 potential product launches over that horizon, including 20 first-to-files. 
Next on Slide 27. Let's talk about our emerging market international business as another driver for sustainable growth. Overall, we expect our international business segment, including Paladin in the more established Canadian market will demonstrate a high single-digit underlying growth rate in 2016, driven by emerging markets businesses. That said, we believe international reported revenues will decline in 2016 due to a stronger dollar versus 2015, increased generic competition for the Paladin portfolio and divestitures of low margin device and vaccine products from the Litha portfolio. However, importantly, we expect that our 2016 operating income from this business segment will be in line with 2015 due to our successful rebasing of our emerging markets businesses.
You will see here the expected impact of this rebasing on Somar and Litha revenues and operating margins in 2016. We expect a significantly improved margin profile in international segment and low double-digit underlying growth across Somar and Litha this year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Suky to talk about our full financial guidance for 2016. Suky?"
28071,325746146,943718,"Endo International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2016",2016-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products,",651,"Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM AG, FROVA, Valganciclovir and low-dose hydrocodone APAP. Second, while our diversified portfolio insulated us for most of 2015, as Rajiv mentioned, we do expect pricing headwinds in U.S. Generics to continue across the sector and for there to be a more challenging pricing environment for commoditized products. And third, we assume current exchange rates for foreign currency conversions. 
So on Slide 30, you will see the highlights of our full year 2016 financial guidance are as follows. We expect total net revenues to be in the range of $4.32 billion to $4.52 billion. We project adjusted gross margins of 63% to 65% this year, which is in line with 2015 despite a higher mix of generics revenue in 2016. This is primarily driven by the continued growth of XIAFLEX, the launch of BELBUCA and our continued shift towards high-value products in our generics business. Each of our segments is expected to maintain or improve their gross margin profile in 2016 versus 2015. Despite increases in branded promotional spending across XIAFLEX and BELBUCA and higher R&D expenses to support the branded and generics pipelines, total expenses are growing below the rate of sales as we leverage G&A and capture the full synergies from the Par transaction. This translates into a projected adjusted operating expense to revenue ratio of 19.5% to 20%, which is more than 150 basis point improvement versus 2015. Under these assumptions, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-40s, which is better than our 2015 EBITDA margin profile. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be approximately $455 million. This estimate includes approximately $34 million of amortization of deferred financing fees in 2016 and also assumes debt pay down of about $500 million in 2016 versus ending gross debt balances in 2015. 
Given our continued progress on building out our infrastructure in Dublin, leveraging deal attributes and executing on our tax strategy, as observed through 2015, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year of 2016. These moving parts translate to an adjusted diluted earnings per share range of $5.85 to $6.20 with approximately 224 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
As expected, our results will be lumpy through the year, driven by a number of factors, including the early investment and corresponding ramp of BELBUCA; the timing of potential market events around key products in the branded and generics portfolio that Rajiv mentioned earlier; the cyclical nature of some of our businesses, including fluctuations and stocking levels; and the anticipated launch of our generic versions of Seroquel XR and Zetia in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 54% of revenues and about 57% of EPS to be in the second half of 2016. This weighting is heavily influenced by the expected timing of the Zetia and SEROQUEL launches. Again, using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 22% of revenues and 18% of EPS to be in the first quarter of 2016. This is driven by normal cyclical trends and destocking that we historically see in the first quarter. Also investment for BELBUCA in the first quarter more than offsets revenues for that product as we will book revenues based on demand until we see a normalized pattern of shipments versus demand trends. 
So in summary, we believe that 2016 financial profile will be a continuation of 2015, which was marked by solid underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and attractive tax rate and strong underlying cash flow conversion.

And then as we closed out our final processes for the year, we did recognize higher level of chargebacks and rebates coming through, specifically around our more commoditized portfolio as well as our pain franchise. That in tandem with onetime charges that occurred in the fourth quarter led to a lower-than-expected fourth quarter. I should say that those onetime charges we do not expect to continue in forward-looking quarterly results, but there is some underlying pressure around pricing that will extend in 2016. Having said that, all of that is baked into our forward-looking estimates for 2016. And as Rajiv noted earlier in scripted remarks, we still see very strong generics growth in the mid-teens to high teens, primarily driven by our injectables business, continued growth across the base as well as our launches on day certain products.

And then when you add in continued growth of XIAFLEX as well as BELBUCA, both of which have gross margin profiles above the company average, you start to form a picture of where we're going to see this gross margin expansion into 2016 and one that we're very pleased and confident in. And then from an operating margin perspective, as I said, we are going to spend more against advertising and promoting -- promotion against XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are going to spend more this year around R&D for generics and for branded, full stop. However, we are getting operating leverage through G&A as well as through the full realization of the Par synergies sometime in mid-2016. So not only do we get operating margin expansion -- gross margin expansion, we're going to see operating margin expansion as well and also on top of a very favorable tax rate."

And just to touch on your growth question, Louise, let me take a crack at it and then Paul will add. While you mentioned Zetia and Seroquel, keep in mind that what Par has over the '16 to '19 time frame is 100 possible product launches, right? So certainly, Zetia and Seroquel standout because of the magnitude. But as we talked about in the past, those are also partner products, right? So as you look at all this entire horizon, you will have many, many more launches, most of which are not partnered where the bottom line is -- equates entirely to Endo, right? So from that standpoint, we do see new launches being the primary driver of growth in this business in '16 as well as into the future. I would also say that the injectables business has been a great performer for Par. It's tripled in size since JHP was acquired by Par, and we expect to see that momentum continue in '16 as well as beyond. I don't know, Paul, if you'd like to add anything to that."

I mean, when we look at 2016 -- I mean, we all know that Zetia and quetiapine are clearly large drivers coming at the end of Q4. And not apologizing for that, those are hard to develop products, hard to partner products and we're very proud of that relationships. That said, we have about 20 products that we should be launching in 2016, albeit maybe not major, major drivers. But in the generic industry, you never actually know what product can outperform. And as some examples, when we look at what we achieved in 2015 that are carrying us into 2016, we had a handful of carryover products like pramipexole, dutasteride, tamsulosin. These are relatively smaller type products that ultimately have limited competition. They're going to carry us into the first part of 2016. Again, hard to make, but from a brand sales standpoint, maybe not of the largest products, but good drivers. When we look a little bit at the sterile portfolio, we are real proud of what we have in Rochester. I think it's a great time to have sterile facility in U.S. soil. It continues to be a barrier to entry. Products like Vasostrict have continued to outperform, and that's on the branded side. But additionally, we have a handful of generic products that have had limited competition, products like [indiscernible] and ethacrynic acid. These are all products that have been genericized, but limited competition. And again, these factored in with some of our overlap and carryover products from last year should give us a good basis for 2016."

We have discussed mesh over the course of the last 2 years, and I think as you know, with this mass tort litigation situations, it is very difficult to predict the end, right? That being said, what I would say is that we have come a long way. And although the environment has continued to be more challenging than we had thought, I mean, with the initial settlements, which, by the way, I'm glad we did, but the reality is that the rest of industry at that time didn't follow with additional settlements as we would have expected, right, and there was increased advertising, which is kind of what's led to this additional bolus of claims in the back end of 2015. Now as we look at what we have done here though, I do feel good that the current settlements that we just announced this morning are ones that are focused on the high-value claims. And effectively, what is left is what we believe to be a much lower value set of portfolio cases, many of them could be spurious. And in addition, this is -- there's an evidence of potential fraud amongst some of these cases as well, right? So as we look at what remains, we do think it is a portfolio we can be a lot more aggressive in terms of how we approach it, either in terms of taking some cases to trial as well as potentially through an investigation of this fraud, seeking to dismiss a chunk of it as well, right? So -- and also keep in mind, we've now put a significant time between us and the public health notice that the FDA issued in 2011. That again should also be another factor that drives to reduce the number of new cases. And then finally, our decision to shut down the ASTORA business also will contribute to reducing the potential for future liability. So I think as we stand here today, we do feel good about where we've taken the mesh liability despite the additional increment that we saw in 2015. We do expect to resolve the remainder of it over the course of the next couple of years. There's no guarantee that accrual may or may not change. What I would say is that we are confident given what we know now about where we have a broader situation. And then fundamentally, we're a different company now, right? So we have, on adjusted basis, more than $2.5 billion or roughly around $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, which allows us the ability to manage this over time and makes it a lot more manageable -- or on our cash."

Relative to your question on how it impacts cash flow -- so as we pointed out in the slides, at the end of fourth quarter, we've got a pretax remaining cash call of about $1.5 billion after we make these additional accruals. So again, pretax remaining cash call of $1.5 billion. We expect in 2016 to pay somewhere around $850 million to $900 million of that $1.5 billion on a pretax basis. But after you consider the tax refund that we'll be getting as part of our structuring of the AMS sale, our post-tax obligation for mesh in 2016 will be somewhere between $150 million to $250 million, so quite manageable in the backdrop of $2 billion plus EBITDA in 2016. As we move to 2017, as we've put in the slide, we expect the post-tax cash call there for the residual of that liability that I talked about to be somewhere between $350 million and $450 million, and again, that's going to be on the base of EBITDA from 2016 of $2 billion plus to one that's growing double digits into 2017.

I will also say as we move forward into '16, Paul is looking at this portfolio as one portfolio, so we will not break out Par versus legacy Qualitest sales. We treat this as one business and that's how we'll report on it. The charges in the fourth quarter were about $30 million that we consider to be onetime and nonrecurring. It's really 3 factors that make this up. Well, there's a number of factors, 3 of which are examples -- are around trade disputes in the fourth quarter. We have some changes in estimates around gross connects. And third, we had some charges higher than expected around the harmonization of our methodologies around gross connects as we integrated Par and Qualitest. Again, we do not expect those to reoccur on a quarterly basis going forward. Your last question, Greg, around the tax rate, again, very pleased where the tax rate is migrating.

And the second question is the bigger picture one. I guess, over the last 18 months, the company has done 2 large acquisitions with Auxilium and Par. You pursued probably a third one with Salix. As I think about the next 12 months and the evolution of the company, is this just a fundamentally different environment from an M&A perspective where we're not going to fuse big deals or they're much less likely? Or do you see what's happening in the market now, just a temporary pause or slowdown and that eventually, we're going to see the high level of consolidation that has been playing over the last few years kind of returning to the sector?"

In the month of February, I was personally at a national sales meeting. We are very excited and expanded the pain field [indiscernible] also, the feedback for the product has been very good, and all of our managed care conversations are going well, right? That being said, it's early days from a managed care contracting standpoint. It's also early days in terms of the actual launch of the product. And as we had indicated before, while we're -- every component [ph] in this product, which is why we've put out an aspirational number for 2019 of $250 million, we do expect the ramp to be somewhat gradual in the first 12 months, and that's just reflecting unknowns, right? So this is a different format of buccal patch, which, while there are many advantages, patients and physicians need to get used to it. For those patients that are on other LAOs that are being transitioned to BELBUCA that needs to be -- down titration and up titration. So these things will take time for physicians to get used to. And also, as you well know, from a market access standpoint, while commercial covered lives, you can contract early in a launch, when it comes to Medicaid Part D coverage, which is roughly about 1/3 of the coverage in this market, that usually waits for a full cycle, right? So we certainly would look to 2017 to have a more -- much more substantial ramp than in 2016. But all the early signs are well within our expectations of what we expect to see for the product. On your question on M&A, let me answer from an Endo perspective and then -- and see if we have any further clarification on it. For us, as you pointed out, 2015 was a very, very transformational year in terms of transactions, right? So we -- in particular, we concluded Auxilium, the Par transaction and at a small level, Aspen transaction in South Africa, which essentially gave us new platforms, right, and a sense of critical mass, particularly in our generics business. In many ways, we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, which is to get a set of assets, which, even if we do no further M&A, gives us a path to double-digit growth. And then you couple that with a market environment where the debt markets are weak as are the equity markets. But for us, leaving the market conditions aside, 2016 really is about execution, which is why we've talked so much about BELBUCA, about XIAFLEX, the Par integration. Those are the things that are going to make us successful. So from that perspective, M&A is not a key priority for us in 2016. I have said -- in the past, I've said we will continue to monitor opportunities. But really strictly, I think the past opportunities that make sense for us in 2016 will be the small in-licensing or product acquisition here or there either for our branded business or international, but we're talking -- we have a very small call on our cash for doing those types of things if the opportunity come across them. In terms of larger transactions, it is not in our anticipation to do -- to look for large acquisitions in 2016. I have, however, said that if there are -- if there is a larger merger, which could be value-creating that is done on the basis of the relative value of 2 companies, and those are the types of things that we certainly will evaluate if they come our way. But certainly, it is not high on our list of priorities in terms of acquisitions as we look out over '16. Now back to your question about the nature of what's going on in the industry, I would say, certainly, the debt markets and equity markets have led to somewhat of a pause. But overall, if we look over the last 20, 30 years, this is a still highly fragmented industry. There are lots of -- it's been a deal-rich industry for a long period of time. Obviously, those deals are cyclical, and my suspicion is that deals will continue to be an important part of this industry as we look forward. But 2016 is certainly likely to be -- to see a pause, at least from our perspective."

Can you just talk if there was an inventory build there or what was going on? Second of all, you've talked about 2017 kind of implying a $7 number, which now, with Voltaren Gel back, seems a little low number and especially given the way you're talking about tax rate now. Relative to before, I would think that, that number of $7 is too low and needs to be brought up. So maybe you can talk about that a little. And then third, I'm just trying to understand, on the generics business, the pricing that you're talking about. There's one aspect of it, which is the commodity pricing, but then there's the other aspect, which is the pain products, which have been really important for you. And I guess, the question is, we've heard from other companies in the space, and they were complaining about new players coming back last year and they were complaining about pricing in that market and they were having some troubles there, and yet Endo was not complaining at all at that time. And now there seems to be a delayed impact. So I'm trying to understand why is that."

Let me -- let's see if we can hit your questions in order. With respect to the V Gel, it was a very good year last year.

With respect to the V Gel, it was a very good year last year. We had, I think, double-digit prescription volume growth, and that was the driver of V Gel for the year. In the LIDODERM, I think we have been -- that we've been successful in holding some of our contracts through '15, probably even better than we had expected on the branded LIDO. But as we enter into '16, we do expect to see some drop-off of those contracts and that would be seen when we see our 2016 results, but it's already factored into our guidance. 2017, Marc, we're not going to comment on 2017. Clearly, we made that commentary in the back -- against the backdrop of the Par transaction. First of all, I'm delighted to say what we committed to the outside world when we did the Par transaction, which was an accretion number for 2016, that is going out in our guidance as well as the implied multiple that we put out there for the Par transaction, which was 10 to 11x for synergy EBITDA multiple that is also following through in the 2016 numbers. As you said, there are lots of other puts and takes in our business. Certainly, V Gel is one. We are very excited about the extension of the agreement. There's always the possibility and potential of a generic on V Gel, which we also have to keep in mind, which, it somewhat offset  in our new agreement by the fact that we have the right to an Authorized Generic. And a lot of 2017 will also depend on how we're doing on BELBUCA and XIAFLEX. So we are very optimistic as we look at the '16 and beyond time horizon for Endo. That being said, we're not going to provide any specific further guidance on '17. On the generics question, I'll start and I'll bounce it to Paul. I think what I would say is if you could separate the commodity -- the traditional commodity products from the pain products, and as you pointed out, pain has been a traditional area of strength to us, we have often taken the approach of focusing on value versus pure volume on the pain business, right? So although we've taken some substantial volume declines in our pain portfolio, they are somewhat anticipated based on the price increases we took and of course, we've taken. So net-net, from a value standpoint, we're actually pleased with how the pain portfolio has performed. But is there a pricing pressure in pain as well as the commodity portfolio? The answer is yes because there are smaller players who tend to be aggressive even in the pain arena now, more so than they have been in the past. I don't know, Paul, if you have any comments about that."

But we had our select wins, right, across the board. So to Rajiv's point, select wins, yes, we may have sacrificed certain pricing -- sorry, certain volume shortfalls.

So that -- there's probably a little bit of stocking impact going in the fourth quarter but nothing out of the ordinary.

I think as we enter 2016, we are excited about everything, all the changes we put in place, both internal as well as some of the new programs that we have put in place like the disease awareness program that I referred to in Peyronie's disease. So many of those are just now kicking off. So realistically, for them to have a real impact, I think you're looking at probably the third quarter before we can really report back on successes of these programs, but early indicators of all of them have been very positive."

In our specialty business, there are 2 field forces, one is focused on urology, and that field force carries in the first position as XIAFLEX for Peyronie's disease and also carries our long-acting testosterone replacement therapies, which are AVEED and TESTOPEL. We have a second specialty field force, which is a smaller one that is focused on XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture and SUPPRELIN LA, which is our product for central precocious puberty. We also have a smaller field force, which we inherited from Par, which, I must say, we are all very impressed with their early performance. They are focused on selling the -- selling NASCOBAL, which is a product that came over from the Par transaction, but we are also using that field force as a mechanism to provide some initial launch support -- additional launch support for BELBUCA. And over time, we'll take on the promotion of some of these smaller brands. So net-net, at this point, we're very pleased with the promotional mix that we have in our field force.

So we actually are seeing some progress versus our original expectations. As you think about 2017 moving on, we would characterize that as sort of low teens type of tax rate. The reason why that migrates up a little bit is you continue to drip off deal attributes that were created over the last couple of years.

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning. 
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings presentation. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for today's call. We will start with an overview of Endo's transformation in 2015, and we'll move to review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, walking through our U.S. Branded, U.S. Generics and International businesses. We will then turn to our full year 2016 outlook and financial guidance. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. 
Moving on to Slide 4. 2015 was a year of transformative growth for Endo, as we worked towards our goal of improving lives while creating value. We made significant progress in our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business segment, completing the acquisition of Auxilium and revitalizing our product portfolio and R&D pipeline. We also secured FDA approval for BELBUCA and extended our Voltaren Gel licensing agreement. In addition, we received a favorable IP ruling for OPANA ER and are continuing to advance that product with the recently submitted data package to the FDA that we feel could support an abuse-deterrent formulation label expansion. The FDA has accepted that submission and set an action date of July 29, 2016. Collectively, these efforts and our continued execution across our full branded portfolio of products resulted in full year 4% underlying revenue growth for 2015.
Next, 2015 was a year of transformation and achieving critical mass for our U.S. Generics business. In September, we acquired Par Pharmaceutical, expanding our portfolio with higher barrier to entry and alternative-dosage products, tripling our R&D pipeline and creating a top 4 U.S. generics company. After beginning full-scale integration in the fall, we've continued to optimize our generics business operations and product portfolio, ultimately driving 11% underlying revenue growth in 2015 in this segment. Our International segment was also rebased in 2015, positioning our emerging-market businesses strongly for growth in 2016 and beyond. For example, in our Litha business, we focused on core pharmaceuticals, acquiring a product and R&D portfolio from Aspen and divesting noncore assets like devices and vaccines. Overall, we drove 6% underlying revenue growth in our international segment in 2015.
Finally, we continue to evolve in both corporate structure and strategy. We divested our AMS men's health business to further sharpen our focus on specialty pharmaceuticals. We continued to build out and enhance our Irish infrastructure. We generated strong underlying cash flow from operations, in line with expectations. In short, we have established a platform that, even if we pursue no additional M&A, positions us for future double-digit underlying growth and expanding margins. 2015 was indeed an important and transformative year in Endo's evolution. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see that evolution reflected in our solid financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Suky will provide more details about our results in just a few minutes. 
Next on Slide 6, let's talk about U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals. In 2015, our rebuilt branded portfolio drove underlying revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Key drivers of that growth included XIAFLEX, which continued to perform in line with our expectations. We have also officially launched BELBUCA and expect that product to be an important growth driver moving forward. The kickoff for this differentiated Schedule III product took place at our national sales meeting earlier this month, and I can personally attest to the excitement and enthusiasm of our significantly expanded pain field force. All of us at Endo believe that this first and only currently approved buprenorphine buccal film for chronic pain does offer an important new treatment option for patients. Also in December, we executed a new agreement to extend our commercialization for the market-leading Voltaren Gel through 2023 and secured rights to any future Authorized Generic for that product. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Let's look at a snapshot of how XIAFLEX performed for the year. While XIAFLEX U.S. revenues represent approximately 12% of our branded full year reported revenues and only 5% of overall Endo full year reported revenues, the product continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity, and we are excited about the potential in its currently approved indications as well as in the R&D pipeline. Overall, XIAFLEX for Peyronie's disease saw a strong 72% full year demand growth with vials totaling nearly 30,000 in 2015. We continue to expand our physician base and are increasing our efforts to broaden clinical awareness. We believe the PD patient base can also expand. Our broader DTC campaigns, including a comprehensive disease awareness program with celebrity spokesperson, Dr. Jerry Punch, a long-time ESPN commentator and MD, are formally kicking off next week. In Dupuytren's contracture, we saw a steady 12% full year demand growth in 2015, which is especially encouraging given that we are 5 years post launch. Our continuing efforts in this indication are focused on expanding the physician user base, educating patients about an effective nonsurgical option, and with the multi-cord label expansion, building the average number of vials per patient over time.
Next, let's talk about our U.S. Generics business on Slide 8. Overall, we were able to drive an underlying growth rate in the double digits for the full year despite increasing pricing pressures across the sector. We are very pleased with the strong contribution provided by the legacy Par business in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our international -- our internal expectations. The legacy Qualitest businesses, while diversified and historically insulated from the challenging pricing environment, did experience some volume loss and pricing pressure in the fourth quarter due to increased competition in multi-player categories. While we have seen volume declines in some areas of this business, it is important to note that 80% of Qualitest's extended unit loss in the full year 2015 versus prior year was driven by only a handful of products that correspond to approximately 20% of Qualitest reported net sales in 2014. 
The fourth quarter also saw a more mild cold/flu season, that we believe contributed to lower-than-expected overall generic sales performance. As you will note, actual full year underlying generics growth was lower than preliminary estimates shared earlier this year. This was due to fourth quarter actual sales of our legacy Qualitest portfolio. Versus our preliminary expectations, part of the shortfall was driven by a number of nonrecurring net charges that were recorded as part of our year-end processes. While these types of customary charges -- while these types of charges are customary in any given quarter, we did see a higher level in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also the shortfall was driven by a combination of higher-than-anticipated rebates and chargebacks that came through on fourth quarter sales identified during our year-end close processes in January and February. These shortfalls were offset by better-than-expected results in our branded business, bringing the total company performance in line with our 2015 preliminary expectations, once again highlighting the value of our diversified revenue mix. We will talk more about our expectations for the generics pricing climate in 2016 and beyond when we discuss our full year guidance later in this call.
Next on Slide 9, you will see that 2015 was a year of rebasing for growth and increasing profitability for our International Pharmaceutical segment. Paladin continues to be a steady high-margin contributor, with recent launches providing potential upside for the business over time. In the fourth quarter, the impact of these launches were offset by the loss of exclusivity on select products, leading to some modest noncash impairments. Our Somar business continues to grow, driven by products across this broad portfolio. It was also a year of transformation for Litha with the Aspen portfolio acquisition and our divestiture of noncore product lines, which closed earlier this month. That business is now more sharply and strategically focused on higher-growth and higher-margin pharmaceutical products. I should note that, similar to what we've seen across the sector and broader markets, a stronger U.S. dollar did impact our reported performance for the quarter and full year. 
On Slide 10, you will see our reported segment revenues continued to grow in 2015. 
Now for a more comprehensive look at our financial results, let me turn the call over to Suky. Suky?"
28071,325746146,943866,"Endo International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2016",2016-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone.

As Rajiv mentioned, the full year 2015 financial results were solid and characterized by a diversified and profitable business. On Slide 11, you will see that we achieved robust performance in 2015 with increased revenues, adjusted margins growing faster than revenue, progress on our tax planning strategies and adjusted earnings per share growth. 
Moving to Slide 12. Let's take a more detailed look at our underlying cash flow from operations in 2015, which remained strong throughout the year. We view this as a quality measure of our overall results and our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. What you will see on this slide is that our 2015 reported cash flow from operations was impacted by a number of noncore cash outlays that are centered around product liabilities and nonrecurring costs related to M&A transactions completed in 2015. If you neutralize these items, cash flow from operations have a high correlation to adjusted net income. We expect this profile to continue into 2016. As a note, you will see -- also see more information on our cash conversion cycle related to working capital in the appendix of today's slide presentation.
Next on Slide 13, we would like to provide you more background around the mesh product liability accrual in the fourth quarter and how that is projected to impact future financial results. The environment around mesh product liability has evolved rapidly, with an influx of claims having been presented to the company in late 2015. We believe these additional claims are primarily the result of increased advertising by plaintiff's attorneys, a lack of meaningful settlements by other mesh manufacturers and higher-value verdicts awarded against other manufacturers. That said, we've taken the approach to strategically settle higher-value and quality case inventories with key plaintiff's lawyers in certain individual cases. Also we plan to shift our strategy to vigorously defend and, if appropriate, litigate remaining cases and seek relief from the federal court in the ongoing mesh multi-district litigation. I note that our accrual is based on claims that are settled or are considered probable in estimate [ph]. We currently are aware of approximately 8,000 purported claims that have not been accrued for, because based on the analysis by the company and outside legal counsel, we believe this portfolio could be of lower value and lower quality as almost all of the claims are lacking medical records and/or basic demographic information. We've also recently become aware of what we believe may be fraudulent or other wrongful activities relating to the generation of certain mesh claims. While we do not yet know the scope of such activities, we plan to fully investigate them and, if appropriate, will vigorously pursue all available remedies against each responsible party and cooperate with law enforcement authorities, other mesh manufacturers and the court.
Importantly, we have seen the rate of purported cases decrease substantially in the early part of 2016 as we continue to make progress in narrowing the mesh liability tail. We are also reducing the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants through our decision to shut down our ASTORA Women's Health business, which we announced earlier today. 
Now turning to the accrual. Our pretax product liability accrual as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, about $150 million was paid out in Qualified Settlement Funds or QSFs. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $834 million pretax charge to increase the estimated product liability accrual for mesh cases. Reflected in this increase as a conservative measure, based on the lack of any meaningful reduction factor observed to date, we have removed the reduction or kick-out factor, resulting in a $401 million impact. Total increase also reflects a $433 million impact, primarily related to the execution of additional master settlement agreements in 2016. It is important to note that we believe these recently settled cases represent a higher value and quality portfolio cases with a higher mix of explant surgeries or revisions and are not representative of overall settlement per-case averages. At the end of the fourth quarter 2015, the amount funded in the QSF was $579 million. This brings us to a total remaining mesh liability, pretax cash call, of approximately $1.5 billion. Our total remaining mesh liability post-tax cash call based on the current accrual is projected to be approximately $575 million through 2017, with about $150 million to $250 million paid in 2016 and approximately $325 million to $425 million paid in 2017. The overall pretax cash call is mitigated by an expected tax refund of approximately $700 million that is expected in the first half of 2016. With these post-tax cash call projections and a robust underlying cash generation, we have the confidence that we can continue to delever into the 3 to 4x range in the second half of 2016 and expect further delevering into 2017. 
Next, on Slide 14, let's talk briefly about the announcement we made this morning regarding ASTORA Women's Health business. As you know, we successfully divested the AMS men's health business and launched a strategic sale process for AMS Women's Health, now ASTORA Women's Health, in 2015. That process did result in formal bids for ASTORA. However, Endo has now determined that the best strategy is to wind down ASTORA business operations. This decision was a difficult one as it impacts our dedicated employees, the physician community and importantly, the patients for whom ASTORA products are important treatment options. Key factors that drove our decision include the evolving product liability landscape around vaginal mesh has been challenging and continues to evolve for all manufacturers, including ASTORA. And second, by shutting down the business as opposed to selling it, we're able to reduce the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants, which would not have been achievable in the event of a sale of the ASTORA business. So we will now work to support physician transition plans to alternate products. We expect to cease business operations for ASTORA by March 31, 2016. On other balance sheet matters, as noted in our press release, we took noncash impairment charges totaling approximately $140 million in the quarter. These charges are on a total goodwill and intangible balance of $15 billion as of December 31, 2015. The majority or about $86 million of the charges were related to Paladin and is driven by the loss of exclusivity of certain products. As we noted at Q3, we finalized our goodwill testing in Q4 and guided that there could be modest changes to impairments in the fourth quarter.
I would like to emphasize that 2015 was another year of transformation for Endo, and one that positions us for future growth and profitability. Specifically, it was a year where we further diversified and expanded our revenue base. We delivered solid underlying growth in a challenging market. We expanded margins, improved our underlying after-tax cash flow conversion, we built a strong branded and generics product pipeline, we improved our operating model and execution and made continued progress on narrowing the tail of the company's mesh-related product liability. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Rajiv to discuss our key priorities and growth drivers for 2016. Rajiv?"

Let me first echo your comments about our dedicated ASTORA employees and management team and take a moment to thank them for their contributions and commitment to the business. We would also like to thank the physician community, which has been so supportive of ASTORA and its products. 
Now moving to Slide 16. As we enter 2016, we have set out a number of strategic and operational priorities. First, we are focused on value creation, including a strong commercial launch of BELBUCA, continued growth of XIAFLEX in DC and PD and the seamless integration and continued growth for our generics business. Second, we are executing using our differentiated operating model. We are advancing our derisked R&D pipeline and moving key XIAFLEX programs into clinical trials this year, and we are continuing past [ph] R&D pipeline momentum and productivity. Third, Endo is achieving sustainable growth. As Suky mentioned, we expect to delever back down to the 3 to 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA range this year. And in our continuing efforts to diversify our revenue base, we expect to drive underlying growth in our emerging markets with our rebased Somar and Litha businesses. 
Next on Slide 17, we are very pleased to have launched BELBUCA last week. We believe BELBUCA is well differentiated as it combines Schedule III status, proven efficacy and established safety and tolerability profile of buprenorphine with a novel delivery system that adds convenience and flexibility for patients. To support our launch into the nearly $5 billion, long-acting opioid market, we've more than doubled our pain field force and have been working to ensure broad patient access. We believe BELBUCA is strongly positioned for growth and are projecting sales to be greater than $250 million in 2019, which, while significant, represents only a small proportion of the existing current market. 
Turning to Slide 18. You will see the scope and size of the chronic pain burden that we are looking to address with BELBUCA. More than 30% of all Americans or about 100 million people are suffering from chronic pain. This is more than diabetes, coronary heart disease and cancer combined. 
On Slide 19, let's discuss where we are positioning BELBUCA within the chronic pain treatment paradigm. We see a prime opportunity for BELBUCA to serve those patients who are transitioning from short-acting opioids to a long-acting opioid treatment. We also see potential for BELBUCA and its differentiated product profile to make an impact by capturing patients searching from other long-acting opioids or those who are opioid-naive and are going directly to a long-acting opioid product. In short, we believe the opportunity for BELBUCA is exciting and significant, and our early feedback from customers on the launch has been very positive. 
Next on Slide 20, let's talk about our progress with XIAFLEX. XIAFLEX continues to perform in line with our internal growth expectations. We continue to aspire to build a $1 billion franchise around this molecule. We are projecting continued momentum into 2016 and double-digit growth for this product over our planning horizon. This growth will be fueled in part by our multi-pronged sales and marketing campaigns designed to increase physician and patient awareness. In terms of the R&D pipeline, XIAFLEX continues to exceed our internal -- initial expectations and are continuing to move new programs into the clinic this year. 
Next on Slide 21, you will see the considerable market expansion opportunity for XIAFLEX. While it was launched more than 5 years ago and has seen steady growth and increasing traction over time, we believe there's a significant opportunity for us to grow market share for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture using our DTC campaigns and to continue building traction for the multi-cord indication. In Peyronie's disease, we are seeking to expand the market through an unbranded disease awareness campaign. While a large number of diagnosed patients are currently untreated, XIAFLEX is showing very strong penetration amongst those patients that are treated. We believe that by continuing to capture those patient treatments and expanding the base of patients seeking a treatment option, we can continue the robust double-digit growth in this indication.
In summary, across our branded business in 2016, we expect to drive growth with BELBUCA, XIAFLEX and other products, including our long-acting TRT portfolio, with some offset by continued erosion in our legacy products. As a result, we project low single-digit underlying growth for this business. 
Moving to Slide 22. Our focus on value creation also includes our U.S. Generics business. This 2015 and 2016 breakout of our pro forma generics revenue illustrates key segments of our Par business as well as how those segments are growing. Most importantly, the segments that are growing substantially are also those that represent our highest-value products. In fact, we project that in 2016, more than 40% of our generics revenues will come from revenues in our highest-value and highest-growth categories. First, new launches and alternative dosages will be a key growth driver this year as it includes the introduction of first-to-file products like the generic versions of Zetia and Seroquel XR, which we expect to bring to market at the end of 2016. This category also includes differentiated higher-barrier-to-entry and higher-margin products like patches, powders, ophthalmics and other alternative dosages. 
Next, sterile injectables have tripled in net sales since Par acquired JHP in 2014, and these products have high barriers to entry, high margins and strong competitive positioning and growth potential. We project significant continued double-digit growth, with gross margins well above the company average for this segment in 2016. In summary, across our generics business in 2016, we project underlying growth in the mid to high teens. 
Moving to Slide 23. You will see that the effect of our collective efforts and our acquisition of Par in 2015 are not only increasing the size of our portfolio and generics pipeline, but also growing revenue and improving our gross margins. We expect to meaningfully continue this expansion into 2016 and beyond.
Next on Slide 24. Let's talk about our differentiated operating model, specifically our derisked XIAFLEX R&D pipeline. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that we will initiate new clinical programs this year. Beyond that, we see a broad range of potential aesthetic and therapeutic indications with significant unmet needs with large patient populations and market potential that we believe will drive the long-term value of XIAFLEX. 
Moving to Slide 25. Let me take a moment to provide you with an overview of our recently initiated Phase IIb clinical trial in cellulite. Cellulite affects nearly all women and there is little evidence that current treatments are effective. 
Moving to Slide 26. Our differentiated operating model and derisked R&D approach also drives our generics activities. Par brought with it some of the industry's strongest Paragraph IV, first-to-file and first-to-market R&D capabilities. Those capabilities are fueling a projected stream of potential high-value, high-margin product launches in 2016 to 2019 time frame. Specifically, we project more than 100 potential product launches over that horizon, including 20 first-to-files. 
Next on Slide 27. Let's talk about our emerging market international business as another driver for sustainable growth. Overall, we expect our International business segment, including Paladin in the more established Canadian market, will demonstrate a high single-digit underlying growth rate in 2016, driven by emerging markets businesses. That said, we believe international reported revenues will decline in 2016 due to a stronger dollar versus 2015, increased generic competition for the Paladin portfolio and divestitures of low-margin device and vaccine products from the Litha portfolio. However, importantly, we expect that our 2016 operating income from this business segment will be in line with 2015 due to our successful rebasing of our emerging markets businesses.
You will see here the expected impact of this rebasing on Somar and Litha revenues and operating margins in 2016. We expect a significantly improved margin profile in International segment and low double-digit underlying growth across Somar and Litha this year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Suky to talk about our full financial guidance for 2016. Suky?"
28071,325746146,943866,"Endo International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2016",2016-02-29,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products,",650,"Thank you, Rajiv. On Slide 29, we have outlined the key considerations built into our 2016 financial guidance. First, our guidance incorporates a risk-adjusted range of scenarios around potential 2016 generic and competitive entrants for select products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM AG, FROVA, Valganciclovir and low-dose hydrocodone APAP. Second, while our diversified portfolio insulated us for most of 2015, as Rajiv mentioned, we do expect pricing headwinds in U.S. Generics to continue across the sector and for there to be a more challenging pricing environment for commoditized products. And third, we assume current exchange rates for foreign currency conversions. 
So on Slide 30, you will see the highlights of our full year 2016 financial guidance are as follows. We expect total net revenues to be in the range of $4.32 billion to $4.52 billion. We project adjusted gross margins of 63% to 65% this year, which is in line with 2015 despite a higher mix of generics revenue in 2016. This is primarily driven by the continued growth of XIAFLEX, the launch of BELBUCA and our continued shift towards high-value products in our generics business. Each of our segments is expected to maintain or improve their gross margin profile in 2016 versus 2015. Despite increases in branded promotional spending across XIAFLEX and BELBUCA and higher R&D expenses to support the branded and generics pipelines, total expenses are growing below the rate of sales as we leverage G&A and capture the full synergies from the Par transaction. This translates into a projected adjusted operating expense to revenue ratio of 19.5% to 20%, which is more than 150 basis point improvement versus 2015. Under these assumptions, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-40s, which is better than our 2015 EBITDA margin profile. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be approximately $455 million. This estimate includes approximately $34 million of amortization of deferred financing fees in 2016 and also assumes debt pay-down of about $500 million in 2016 versus ending gross debt balances in 2015. 
Given our continued progress on building out our infrastructure in Dublin, leveraging deal attributes and executing on our tax strategy, as observed through 2015, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year of 2016. These moving parts translate to an adjusted diluted earnings per share range of $5.85 to $6.20 with approximately 224 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
As expected, our results will be lumpy through the year, driven by a number of factors, including the early investment and corresponding ramp of BELBUCA; the timing of potential market events around key products in the branded and generics portfolio that Rajiv mentioned earlier; the cyclical nature of some of our businesses, including fluctuations in stocking levels; and the anticipated launch of our generic versions of Seroquel XR and Zetia in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 54% of revenues and about 57% of EPS to be in the second half of 2016. This weighting is heavily influenced by the expected timing of the Zetia and Seroquel launches. Again, using the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges, we expect about 22% of revenues and 18% of EPS to be in the first quarter of 2016. This is driven by normal cyclical trends and destocking that we historically see in the first quarter. Also investment for BELBUCA in the first quarter more than offsets revenues for that product as we will book revenues based on demand until we see a normalized pattern of shipments versus demand trends. 
So in summary, we believe the 2016 financial profile will be a continuation of 2015, which was marked by solid underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, an attractive tax rate and strong underlying cash flow conversion.

We did start to see the early signs of some volume erosion in our more commoditized parts of our business. And then as we closed out our final processes for the year, we did recognize higher level of chargebacks and rebates coming through, specifically around our more commoditized portfolio as well as our pain franchise. That, in tandem with onetime charges that occurred in the fourth quarter, led to a lower-than-expected fourth quarter. I should say that those onetime charges we do not expect to continue in forward-looking quarterly results, but there is some underlying pressure around pricing that will extend in 2016. Having said that, all of that is baked into our forward-looking estimates for 2016. And as Rajiv noted earlier in scripted remarks, we still see very strong generics growth in the mid-teens to high teens, primarily driven by our injectables business, continued growth across the base as well as our launches on day [ph] certain products.

So actually a little bit better than expected from the closing of Par.

As we actually work through our plan and our portfolio prioritization, we're actually moving to a higher mix of higher-value products, which is ultimately expanding our margins. So as Paul talked about or as Rajiv talked about in his scripted remarks, the growth of the injectable franchise is one that is characterized with a gross margin profile well above the overall company average as we think about the launches of some of our day [ph] certain products. Those are also products that have gross margin profiles well ahead of the overall gross margin average. And then when you add in continued growth of XIAFLEX as well as BELBUCA, both of which have gross margin profiles above the company average, you start to form a picture of where we're going to see this gross margin expansion into 2016 and one that we're very pleased and confident in. And then from an operating margin perspective, as I said, we are going to spend more against advertising and promoting -- promotion against XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are going to spend more this year around R&D for generics and for branded, full stop. However, we are getting operating leverage through G&A as well as through the full realization of the Par synergies sometime in mid-2016. So not only do we get operating margin expansion -- gross margin expansion, we're going to see operating margin expansion as well and also on top of a very favorable tax rate."

I would also say that the injectables business has been a great performer for Par.

That said, we have about 20 products that we should be launching in 2016, albeit maybe not major, major drivers. But in the generic industry, you never actually know what product can outperform. And as some examples, when we look at what we achieved in 2015 that are carrying us into 2016, we had a handful of carryover products like pramipexole, dutasteride, tamsulosin. These are relatively smaller-type products that ultimately have limited competition. They're going to carry us into the first part of 2016. Again, hard to make, but from a brand sales standpoint, maybe not of [ph] the largest products, but good drivers. When we look a little bit at the sterile portfolio, we are real proud of what we have in Rochester. I think it's a great time to have a sterile facility on U.S. soil. It continues to be a barrier to entry. Products like Vasostrict have continued to outperform, and that's on the branded side. But additionally, we have a handful of generic products that have had limited competition, products like dexmetatopadine [ph] and ethacrynic acid. These are all products that have been genericized, but limited competition. And again, these, factored in with some of our overlap and carryover products from last year, should give us a good basis for 2016."

We have discussed mesh over the course of the last 2 years, and I think as you know, with these mass tort litigation situations, it is very difficult to predict the end, right? That being said, what I would say is that we have come a long way. And although the environment has continued to be more challenging than we had thought, I mean, with the initial settlements, which, by the way, I'm glad we did, but the reality is that the rest of industry at that time didn't follow with additional settlements as we would have expected, right, and there was increased advertising, which is kind of what's led to this additional bolus of claims in the back end of 2015. Now as we look at what we have done here though, I do feel good that the current settlements that we just announced this morning are ones that are focused on the high-value claims. And effectively, what is left is what we believe to be a much lower-value set of portfolio cases, many of them could be spurious. And in addition, this is -- there's an evidence of potential fraud amongst some of these cases as well, right? So as we look at what remains, we do think it is a portfolio we can be a lot more aggressive in terms of how we approach it, either in terms of taking some cases to trial as well as potentially through an investigation of this fraud, seeking to dismiss a chunk of it as well, right? So -- and also keep in mind, we've now put a significant time between us and the public health notice that the FDA issued in 2011. That again, should also be another factor that drives to reduce the number of new cases. And then finally, our decision to shut down the ASTORA business also will contribute to reducing the potential for future liability. So I think as we stand here today, we do feel good about where we've taken the mesh liability despite the additional increment that we saw in 2015. We do expect to resolve the remainder of it over the course of the next couple of years. There's no guarantee that accrual may or may not change. What I would say is that we are confident, given what we know now, about where we have brought the situation. And then fundamentally, we're a different company now, right? So we have, on adjusted basis, more than $2.5 billion or roughly around $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, which allows us the ability to manage this over time and makes it a lot more manageable call on our cash."

Relative to your question on how it impacts cash flow -- so as we pointed out in the slides, at the end of fourth quarter, we've got a pretax remaining cash call of about $1.5 billion after we make these additional accruals. So again, pretax remaining cash call of $1.5 billion. We expect in 2016 to pay somewhere around $850 million to $900 million of that $1.5 billion on a pretax basis. But after you consider the tax refund that we'll be getting as part of our structuring of the AMS sale, our post-tax obligation for mesh in 2016 will be somewhere between $150 million to $250 million, so quite manageable in the backdrop of $2 billion plus of EBITDA in 2016. As we move to 2017, as we've put in the slide, we expect the post-tax cash call there for the residual of that liability that I talked about to be somewhere between $350 million and $450 million, and again, that's going to be on the base of EBITDA from 2016 of $2 billion plus, to one that's growing double digits into 2017. So again, very manageable cash call in the backdrop of very robust underlying cash flow generation."

We're also seeing good solid performance in the base business. As Paul talked about a little bit earlier, that should carry over into 2016 as well. I will also say as we move forward into '16, Paul is looking at this portfolio as one portfolio, so we will not break out Par versus legacy Qualitest sales. We treat this as one business and that's how we'll report on it. The charges in the fourth quarter were about $30 million that we consider to be onetime and nonrecurring. It's really 3 factors that make this up. Well, there's a number of factors, 3 of which are examples -- are around trade disputes in the fourth quarter. We have some changes in estimates around gross to nets. And third, we had some charges higher than expected around the harmonization of our methodologies around gross to nets as we integrated Par and Qualitest. Again, we do not expect those to reoccur on a quarterly basis going forward. Your last question, Gregg, around the tax rate, again, very pleased where the tax rate is migrating.

And the second area of growth is the injectables, the sterile injectables portfolio, which is -- which will be a robust contributor to 2016 as well as beyond.

I know you've talked about 2019, but just as we go out to 2016, what type of ramp should we think about here as we're thinking about the initial modeling? And the second question is the bigger-picture one. I guess, over the last 18 months, the company has done 2 large acquisitions with Auxilium and Par. You pursued probably a third one with Salix. As I think about the next 12 months and the evolution of the company, is this just a fundamentally different environment from an M&A perspective where we're not going to these big deals or they're much less likely? Or do you see what's happening in the market now, just a temporary pause or slowdown and that eventually, we're going to see the high level of consolidation that has been playing over the last few years kind of returning to the sector?"

In the month of February, I was personally at a national sales meeting. We are very excited and expanded the pain field force, also the feedback for the product has been very good, and all of our managed care conversations are going well, right? That being said, it's early days from a managed care contracting standpoint. It's also early days in terms of the actual launch of the product. And as we had indicated before, while we have every confidence in this product, which is why we've put out an aspirational number for 2019 of $250 million, we do expect the ramp to be somewhat gradual in the first 12 months, and that's just reflecting unknowns, right? So this is a different format, a buccal patch, which, while there are many advantages, patients and physicians need to get used to it. For those patients that are on other LAOs that are being transitioned to BELBUCA there needs to be down titration and up titration. So these things will take time for physicians to get used to. And also, as you well know, from a market access standpoint, while commercial covered lives, you can contract early in a launch, when it comes to Medicare Part D coverage, which is roughly about 1/3 of the coverage in this market, that usually waits for a full cycle, right? So we certainly would look to 2017 to have a more -- much more substantial ramp than in 2016. But all the early signs are well within our expectations of what we expect to see for the product. On your question on M&A, let me answer from an Endo perspective and then -- and see if we have any further clarification on it. For us, as you pointed out, 2015 was a very, very transformational year in terms of transactions, right? So we -- in particular, we concluded Auxilium, the Par transaction, and at a smaller level, Aspen transaction in South Africa, which essentially gave us new platforms, right, and a sense of critical mass, particularly in our generics business. In many ways, we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, which is to get a set of assets, which, even if we do no further M&A, gives us a path to double-digit growth. And then you couple that with a market environment where the debt markets are weak, as are the equity markets. But for us, leaving the market conditions aside, 2016 really is about execution, which is why we've talked so much about BELBUCA, about XIAFLEX, the Par integration. Those are the things that are going to make us successful. So from that perspective, M&A is not a key priority for us in 2016. I have said -- in the past, I've said we will continue to monitor opportunities. But realistically, I think the types of opportunities that make sense for us in 2016 will be the small in-licensing or product acquisition here or there either for our branded business or international, but we're talking -- we have a very small call on our cash for doing those types of things if the opportunity come across them. In terms of larger transactions, it is not our anticipation to do -- to look for large acquisitions in 2016. I have, however, said that if there are -- if there is a larger merger, which could be value-creating that is done on the basis of the relative value of 2 companies, those are the types of things that we certainly will evaluate if they come our way. But certainly, it is not high on our list of priorities in terms of acquisitions as we look out over '16. Now back to your question about the nature of what's going on in the industry. I would say, certainly, the debt markets and equity markets have led to somewhat of a pause. But overall, if we look over the last 20, 30 years, this is a still highly fragmented industry. There are lots of -- it's been a deal-rich industry for a long period of time. Obviously, those deals are cyclical, and my suspicion is that deals will continue to be an important part of this industry as we look forward. But 2016 is certainly likely to be -- to see a pause, at least from our perspective."

So maybe you can talk about that a little. And then third, I'm just trying to understand, on the generics business, the pricing that you're talking about. There's one aspect of it, which is the commodity pricing, but then there's the other aspect, which is the pain products, which have been really important for you. And I guess, the question is, we've heard from other companies in the space, and they were complaining about new players coming back last year and they were complaining about pricing in that market and they were having some troubles there, and yet Endo was not complaining at all at that time. And now there seems to be a delayed impact. So I'm trying to understand why is that."

Let me -- let's see if we can hit your questions in order. With respect to the V Gel, it was a very good year last year.

With respect to the V Gel, it was a very good year last year. We had, I think, double-digit prescription volume growth, and that was the driver of V Gel for the year. In the LIDODERM, I think we have been -- that we've been successful in holding some of our contracts through '15, probably even better than we had expected on the branded LIDO. But as we enter into '16, we do expect to see some drop-off of those contracts and that would be seen when we see our 2016 results, but it's already factored into our guidance. 2017, Marc, we're not going to comment on 2017. Clearly, we made that commentary in the back -- against the backdrop of the Par transaction. First of all, I'm delighted to say what we committed to the outside world when we did the Par transaction, which was an accretion number for 2016, that is borne out in our guidance, as well as the implied multiple that we put out there for the Par transaction, which was 10 to 11x post-synergy EBITDA multiple, that is also following through in the 2016 numbers. As you said, there are lots of other puts and takes in our business. Certainly, V Gel is one. We are very excited about the extension of the agreement. There's always the possibility and potential of a generic on V Gel, which we also have to keep in mind, which -- it's somewhat offset in our new agreement by the fact that we have the right to an Authorized Generic. And a lot of 2017 will also depend on how we're doing on BELBUCA and XIAFLEX. So we are very optimistic as we look at the '16-and-beyond time horizon for Endo. That being said, we're not going to provide any specific further guidance on '17. On the generics question, I'll start and I'll bounce it to Paul. I think what I would say is if you could separate the commodity -- the traditional commodity products from the pain products, and as you pointed out, pain has been a traditional area of strength to us, we have often taken the approach of focusing on value versus pure volume on the pain business, right? So although we've taken some substantial volume declines in our pain portfolio, they are somewhat anticipated based on the price increases we took and of course, we've taken. So net-net, from a value standpoint, we're actually pleased with how the pain portfolio has performed. But is there a pricing pressure in pain as well as the commodity portfolio? The answer is yes because there are smaller players who tend to be aggressive even in the pain arena now, more so than they have been in the past. I don't know, Paul, if you have any comments about that."

So you have the timing -- you've got a timing issue that we were focused on. So to your point, to Rajiv's point, clearly, yes, there are more competitors in the narcotics space, and we're seeing that. But we had our select wins, right, across the board.

So that -- there's probably a little bit of stocking impact going into the fourth quarter, but nothing out of the ordinary. As you pointed out, especially the back end of the fourth quarter tends to be a heavy period because there are many patients who like to schedule their surgeries during that holiday period, so that is also a contributor. I think as we enter 2016, we are excited about everything, all the changes we put in place, both internal as well as some of the new programs that we have put in place like the disease awareness program that I referred to in Peyronie's disease. So many of those are just now kicking off. So realistically, for them to have a real impact, I think you're looking at probably the third quarter before we can really report back on successes of these programs, but early indicators of all of them have been very positive."

And in that field force, we detail BELBUCA, OPANA ER and Voltaren Gel. So those are the 3 products that are detailed. And then on occasion, we do some reminder calls on SUMAVEL. In our specialty business, there are 2 field forces. One is focused on urology, and that field force carries in the first position as XIAFLEX for Peyronie's disease and also carries our long-acting testosterone replacement therapies, which are AVEED and TESTOPEL. We have a second specialty field force, which is a smaller one that is focused on XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture and SUPPRELIN LA, which is our product for central precocious puberty. We also have a smaller field force, which we inherited from Par, which, I must say, we are all very impressed with their early performance. They are focused on selling the -- selling NASCOBAL, which is a product that came over from the Par transaction, but we are also using that field force as a mechanism to provide some initial launch support -- additional launch support for BELBUCA, and over time, will take on the promotion of some of these smaller brands.

So we actually are seeing some progress versus our original expectations. As you think about 2017 moving on, we would characterize that as sort of low teens type of tax rate. The reason why that migrates up a little bit is you continue to drip off deal attributes that were created over the last couple of years. But otherwise, the underlying fundamentals of the tax rate are still very attractive.

You've got a mesh post-tax cash call of about $150 million to $250 million, as we've talked about. Working capital on a day sales basis is going to be relatively steady throughout the year. However, because of the fourth quarter launches of Seroquel and Zetia, we do expect there to be a call on cash in the fourth quarter of somewhere between $200 million to $300 million.

And we also believe that it is to our benefit and to our advantage to be more aggressive with this remaining portfolio, including potentially taking some to trial if we need to. So our current beliefs based on the factors that we have, we do believe that they are lower-value cases. We will deal with them over time, and there is no anticipation of any other settlements in the near term."

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. Let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 earnings presentation. 
On the next 2 slides, you will see a brief agenda and an outline of key themes for today's call. To begin, I will provide a snapshot of our first quarter financial results, which, despite some headwinds, were largely in line with our expectations. However, these headwinds have created substantial challenges to overcome in the remainder of the year. We are providing revised full year 2016 guidance today to reflect these challenges. We will spend some additional time discussing the state of our business, key drivers for this rebasing and our action plans moving forward. 
Specifically, there are 3 factors to call out that we will discuss in more detail on today's call: deeper-than-expected erosion in the legacy Qualitest business; delays in FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products; and earlier-than-expected generic entrant for Voltaren Gel. Importantly, we will also talk about why we believe that our core growth drivers will continue to provide opportunities to execute against our strategic plan and allow us to return to organic growth, improve margins and delever in the medium term. 
Before we begin, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome our 2 new board members on behalf of our board and the company. We are delighted that Doug and Todd have accepted our invitation to join. We look forward to their contributions. 
Moving to Slide 6. You will see the Q1 snapshot of reported segment revenues. In our branded business, we saw solid continued growth for XIAFLEX, which performed well despite the expected historical trend of Q1 seasonality. This growth was offset in part by a decline in Voltaren Gel due to the product's loss of exclusivity in March and continued pressure on the European markets. In our generic segment, the base business erosion continued into the first quarter and was significantly deeper than we expected at approximately 30%. This was driven by continued pricing and competitive pressures on our commoditized MPM products. The erosion was partially offset by strong performance from our sterile injectables portfolio including Vasostrict and the overall performance of the legacy Par portfolio. We will return to these themes when we discuss full year guidance. 
The international business performed as expected with a modest decline in reported revenues. However, our emerging markets businesses continued to show both constant exchange rate revenue growth and underlying growth as well as margin expansion. 
On Slide 7, you will see our first quarter segment revenues as well as reported and underlying growth. 
Next on Slide 8, we provided our first quarter financial results. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let's talk about the state of our business and the context in which we are viewing the remainder of 2016. To best understand where Endo is now, it's important to also understand where we've been and what we've built. When I joined the company in 2013, we chartered a new strategic cause and outlined some very clear goals, as seen here in the left column. Over the next 3 years, we set out to achieve these goals and position Endo for growth. That strategy is still core to Endo and how we run our business. However, what has become clear is that 2016 specialty pharmaceutical landscape and market forces require an evolution of that strategy. 
So let's talk about our path forward. Our goal has not changed. We continue to aspire to build a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company. What has changed rapidly is the landscape and market environment within which we are operating, particularly in generics. What does this mean going forward? It means we're reshaping the path forward for Endo. We are rebasing expectations for the business and are evolving our current strategy to meet challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Ultimately, we are positioning the company for long-term organic and diversified growth, margin improvement and delevering. 
So let me now turn the call over to Paul to discuss key factors and drivers related to generics. Paul?"

Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying an actual sales. The",1670,"Thank you, Rajiv, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying an actual sales. The variances between the sales totals resulted from a greater-than-anticipated erosion and base business of approximately 30%, driven particularly by the legacy Qualitest portfolio. While we expected base erosion to be higher in the first quarter than the full year, the actual erosion was much deeper across our pain portfolio and other commoditized products than originally anticipated. By contrast, the legacy Par portfolio is performing on track with internal expectations. Our sterile injectables product portfolio continued its strong performance with 86% growth over Q1 2015. Our new launches, an alternative dosage product portfolio performance, was stable and largely unchanged year-over-year. 
So let's discuss the factors that impacted these Q1 results that we believe will shape our full year generics performance. Moving to Slide 14. There are rapidly changing market conditions that have affected the broader generic sector and Par. First, we've seen a steep and rapid price erosion caused by payer consolidation that has been more even profound than anticipated. Its effect has exceeded what might have been expected from an ordinary downturn in the industry's traditional pricing cycle. The impact has been particularly acute in the more commodity like product categories as such as our pain and controlled substances portfolio and our immediate-release solid oral dosage forms. 
Second, coupled with this consolidation and new payer environment, competitors are taking aggressive pricing actions to gain market share. Examples include both the 300 and 325 milligrams strength of hydrocodone APAP, butalbital, morphine sulfate and oxycodone. 
Third, there's been a rapid erosion of the pain segment, driven by 3 things: one, continued market contraction; two, increased competitive capacity in pressure; and three, while still early to judge the full impact, we believe the recently issued CDC guidelines will continue to put pressure on an already soft pain market. As you may know, approximately 40% of the legacy Qualitest portfolio was comprised of pain products, so this sector specific weakness has had a disproportionate effect on our generics business. Fourth, there's been a recent end market acceleration of FDA approval for generic products. While we'll ultimately expect this to also benefit the Par portfolio in our own pending submissions over time, the approvals in launches seen in late Q1 and in April of this year have resulted in greater competitive pressure for our products. Fifth and finally, the latest and expected FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products means that we have yet to see the anticipated removal of unapproved competitive products from the market. Correspondingly, we have yet to achieve the market exclusivity that we expected for these products. It's important to note that we still expect these FDA actions but now on a delayed time line. The removal of relevant unapproved products may not occur before first half of 2017 versus our original expectation of early 2016. 
Now that we've talked about what's happened in the generics market, let's also take a few minutes to review when some of these events surfaced, thereby impacting our generic business. In 2016, it's important to note that the U.S. generic landscape has continued to shift, with significant events and updates as recently as late March and April. In fact, it was not until late March that we confirmed the delays on the regulatory actions related to our 505(b)(2) products that I just mentioned. Then in April alone, we see at least 5 competitive product approvals and additional market entrants. Finally, we've also just completed our consortium bid cycle with a more negative output in increased pricing pressure than we anticipated. 
Moving to Slide 16. I do want to take a few moments to discuss our ongoing integration of the Qualitest and Par businesses. Last fall and Q1 of this year, we were conducting an integration of 2 complex generic businesses. What became very clear to those of us who have been in the generic industry for sometimes is that the legacy Par operating model is better positioned to address the challenges of today's evolving market. As a result, we set out to shift the legacy Qualitest portfolio strategy from a high-volume approach to the high-value operating value long practiced by legacy Par. As part of the integration activities, we're also transitioning the legacy Qualitest systems and processes to the Par business platform. The legacy Par systems offer more real-time and product level data, allowing for faster analysis and reaction within a challenging and changing market. While many of these improvements were already planned at Qualitest, the integration of our business will accelerate the benefits. 
Next on Slide 17. Let's talk about what we're doing to address these challenges and best position our generic business moving forward, our action plan. First, we are continuing to maximize our key growth drivers such as our sterile injectables portfolio, led by Vasostrict and approximately 30 new products that we expect to launch this year. Next, our platform for long-term organic growth is our R&D pipeline. We are continuing to advance these more than 250 projects post reprice our expectations and anticipate filing 25 to 30 new submissions in 2016 alone. We're also accelerating the implementation of an optimization and restructuring of our product portfolio and manufacturing facility network. I'll talk more about this restructuring shortly. Additionally, we are accelerating the move of legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform. This is already substantially complete as our commercial insight and forecasting capabilities have been fully transitioned. Finally, critical to our action plan is our ability to execute. This is not the first turbulent market environment that the Par has successfully navigated. Our team is seasoned, capable and prudent. 
Moving to Slide 18. Now permit me to provide some additional detail on the restructuring I mentioned earlier. Most importantly, this restructuring is an acceleration of our ongoing integration and broader optimization efforts designed to prioritize and grow high-value durable assets. It is entirely consistent with our integration activities to date. The restructuring will affect our manufacturing sites in Charlotte and in Huntsville and will result in more than 60 product discontinuations. In addition, we are pruning less value-driven R&D projects so that we can prioritize our investments on differentiated and high-value projects. We expect that the restructuring will be completed by the third quarter of 2017 and will result in a total of approximately $60 million in annualized net run rate savings by Q4 of 2017. We expect to see about $10 million of that gross margin improvement this year. As a result, shortly, we will begin the process of informing employees of these changes. As part of that effort, approximately 740 employees will be impacted under phase transition. For Endo, the Par management team; and for me personally, this is both an extremely [indiscernible] and disappointing to our company. We value our people, and for those who will be affected, we thank you all for what you've contributed to Endo. We'll be providing resources to help manage through this difficult transition. 
And while change is never easy, it is necessary to better position our generics position to successfully compete in the U.S. generics market. So on Slide 19. Let's talk about our full year revenue outlook for the generic segments. We are previously expected a mid-teen underlying growth rate for the business given the erosion now forecasted across the sector and particularly for our base business in the delay in and regulatory action related to our 505(b)(2) products offset by the strong growth projected for sterile injectables and new launches and alternative dosage portfolios, we now expect underlying growth for our generics business to be in the low single digit percentage range. We do expect that erosion on our base business to moderate back to rates typical for the generic industry beyond 2016. The erosion in 2016 is expected to be more acute than historical trends due to our relative pricing and share levels in the pain markets prior to the observed and expected erosion. 
Moving to Slide 20. You'll see a look at our Q1 2016 reported generic net sales annualized versus our full year 2016 guidance midpoint. You can see the projected decline due to non-face business competitive entries in base erosion which we expect to be approximately 5 years per quarter through the end of the year. Our new product launches are a significant driver of growth as illustrated by the green block and bringing to our projected generic net sales midpoint for the year. 
Now let's look at our 2016 launches on Slide 21. We are in a track to launch 30 new products this year Four of these are first-to-file products including our generic Seroquel and generic Zetia products that will launch in the fourth quarter of 2016. Another 2 launch products are alternate dosages and another 9 are sterile injectables. Importantly, and as an illustration of our value-focused strategy platform, nearly 1/3 of our projected launches are products that will be exclusive or faced only one generic competitor. Finally, let's close this generics discussion with a quick review of our robust R&D pipeline on Slide 22. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have more than 250 projects in our reprioritized R&D pipeline. We anticipate launching more than 100 of them between 2016 and 2019, representing a total current market value of nearly $30 billion. Our pipeline is robust, diversified and populated by higher barrier-to-entry in higher margin generic products. We believe that positions us strongly for future growth. I am confident in our platform and I believe that our pipeline is truly differentiated. I know that our team has the experience and the ability to address these challenges and to deliver future generics growth and margin expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Rajiv for a discussion on our branded business. Rajiv?"

Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our U.S. Branded business. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Lortie, President of U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, who will be leaving us to pursue other opportunities. Brian has been a critical part of the efforts to reposition our company over the last 3 years. We will miss him at Endo and wish him well in his future endeavors. 
Moving to Slide 24. Let's talk about factors affecting our U.S. Branded business. First, there has been a recent generic entrant for our Voltaren Gel product. This generic came into the market earlier than we expected and it has affected our 2016 outlook for V Gel. Second, we have seen increasing pressure on our branded pain segment. These include additional competitive entries as well as continual increasing number of public policy and regulatory reactions such as the recent CDC guidelines around opioid prescribing end-use. Additionally, there are reimbursement restrictions now in place for LIDODERM further limiting the use of that branded product. Against this backdrop, we do continue to see significant growth potential in our differentiated products BELBUCA. However, it has progressed at a slower pace than we initially expected due to pain market pressures. That said, we continue to believe in the future of this product at the scheduled 3 alternatives in the opioid category. 
On Slide 25, you will see the opportunity for BELBUCA, the [indiscernible] only buprenorphine Buccal Film for chronic pain management which we launched in late February this year. There are about 90 million total prescriptions written for the treatment of chronic pain below 160 milligrams multi [indiscernible] or MSCs. BELBUCA is at positioned to help patients both from short-acting opioids as well as long-acting opioids. Given the size of both these segments, even with the relatively small share of the available prescription base, BELBUCA could become a very meaningful product in this category. 
It is also important to note that even in these early days, BELBUCA is not only capturing switches from LAOs but also from SAOs and new therapy stocks. Further, we have seen an increasing number of repeat prescription week all week. Its differential profile is resonating well with the [indiscernible] and patients across the spectrum, and our early feedback on access, ease of use, efficacy and side effect profile have all been positive. 
Along these lines, let's look at Slide 26, to talk more about early progress on the BELBUCA launch. There are 3 areas that we are focused on in terms of early launch, traction and feedback. While I won't talk through each bullet here, we did want to provide a comprehensive look at where we are making progress and where we see opportunities to further accelerate BELBUCA launch traction. 
Next on Slide 27, let's talk about XIAFLEX. the XIAFLEX continues its double-digit demand growth profile and we are making good progress in growing that business. We see a significant opportunity to expand both our share of the current treatment market as well as the size of the overall markets for both Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Across both of the DC and PD indications, we have new initiatives focused on driving growth. We are working to broaden our active injector base and have improved targeting to reach the most appropriate positions. Our DTC and print ad campaign efforts are also showing signs of real traction. For example, visitors to the ""Ask About the Curve"" websites spend about 10x longer on the site than an average website visit, and about 1 in 10 visitors click through to find the Peyronie's disease specialist in that area. 
We have also worked to improve convenience with physicians through our reimbursement support initiatives and our product savings program. Overall, these efforts position XIAFLEX for strong continued growth. We expect mid- to high teens percentage growth in 2016.
Moving to Slide 28. Let's talk about the other driver for XIAFLEX growth over the long term: our robust R&D pipeline. We see significant opportunity and substantial value for XIAFLEX across both therapeutic aesthetic indications and have talked about how the product Could be a $1 billion franchise for Endo by the mid-2020s. That opportunity is driven by the more than 12 potential indications currently in the R&D pipeline and the multiple additional programs in even earlier stages of development. As part of our evolved corporate strategy and initiatives to return to organic growth, we are accelerating our R&D programs with XIAFLEX and plan to move 5 programs into the clinic even earlier than previously expected in 2016. It is a time of significant opportunity for these growth drivers in our branded business. We have taken steps to best seize those opportunities and accelerate their growth while also managing the legacy products within our portfolio. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss our full year 2016 financial guidance. Suky?"
28071,331734375,974770,"Endo International plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv and good afternoon, everyone. In an effort to provide you with more clarity, we are providing additional details on how the factors and market conditions that Paul and Rajiv discussed will impact Endo for the rest of 2016. On Slide 30, we",315,"Thank you, Rajiv and good afternoon, everyone. In an effort to provide you with more clarity, we are providing additional details on how the factors and market conditions that Paul and Rajiv discussed will impact Endo for the rest of 2016. On Slide 30, we have provided an outline of the key components of change to our rebased revenue guidance that lead to an 11% reduction. As you can see, the largest driver of the change is the greater-than-expected erosion in our generics-based business. As a reminder, we define base generics as extended release, immediate release and pain and controlled substance products. As with the branded business, our rest of the year projections are based on business and commercial assessment and recent trend announced [indiscernible] product-by-product level that also takes into account the outcomes and competitive actions. 
Approximately 55% of the decline is related to price erosion and 45% relates to volume declines. This is an important variable as price declines fall to margin at 100%. I should also note we expect to realize the value of delayed 505(b)(2) actions later in 2017. 
Next on Slide 31, let's look at the drivers for the changes in our projected gross margin for 2016. Our previous guidance was 63% to 65% for the full year. Given the impacts of key events and market factors, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 60%. Using the midpoint of the previous and revised guidance range, we expect gross margins to decline about 17% versus prior expectations. We are projecting a disproportionally high erosion on gross margin versus revenue due to a number of factors that you will see detailed here in the blue call-out box. Importantly, we do expect to realize gross margin for our 505(b)(2) products in 2017, and we expect to offset the 2016 underabsorption through rationalization efforts into 2017."

We have provided a bridge from our previous EPS expectations for the full year through our revised guidance. The reduction in EPS reflect the revenue and gross margin drivers that I've just discussed. We've taken actions to help offset the declines we are projecting. In 2016, we are reducing OpEx across SG&A while remaining focused on prioritized investments against growth drivers and accelerating our branded R&D programs, and we project improvement in our tax rate. Lastly, we are taking actions to improve our gross margin profile through the planned rationalization that's all covered earlier. 
On Slide 33, you will see our 2016 financial outlook by business segment including expected, reported and underlying growth rates and gross margins across the portfolio. The branded business growth rate reflects the loss of exclusivity of V Gel. The generics outlook reflects the declines in the base business and the delayed regulatory actions that were discussed earlier. And international is broadly in line with previous expectations. 
Next on Slide 34, we have outlined our full revised 2016 financial guidance. From a cadence perspective, we continue to see revenues and EPS weighted to the second half of the year, driven by the launches from the Par portfolio and continued grow from XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We now expect approximately 46% of revenues and 39% of full year EPS in the first half of 2016. This implies a sequential step-down in Q2 due to a number of drivers including the full quarter impact of recently launched generic competitors that we talked about earlier on the call. In addition, we expect a ramp-up in spending int eh second quarter primarily related to our acceleration of R&D programs and commercial efforts in U.S. Branded. We have talked through the moving parts around revenues and gross margin. We expect interest expense to continue to be about $455 million. Our tax rate will be lower due to continued progress around planning strategies and due to a lower mix of U.S. source income while maintaining static debt benefits and acquired attributes. Depending on the nature and timing of potential discrete items, the cadence of tax rate through the year can be lumpy. Consistent with prior commentary we do expect to step up in our tax rate in outer years. We now project that range to be in the high single digits. 
Next on Slide 35. While our first quarter cash flow from operations was negative, it was impacted by a number of items that we consider to be noncore. After considering these items, underlying cash flow from operations continues to be well correlated to adjusted net income. I will also note that our working capital metrics are in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarter, we have provided more details around working capital in the appendix of this presentation. 
Moving to Slide 36. It is important to note that we continue to project robust cash from operations prior to legal-related cash flows. I will note that in early Q2, we received the full tax refund that we pointed to earlier in the year. Ultimately, we expect to use remaining cash to pay done approximately $250 million to $300 million in debt in 2016. 
Finally, on Slide 37, let me provide you with a snapshot of our liquidity profile. This is important because our cash position and liquidity ratios remain strong and well within our covenants as defined under our debt agreements. We do not foresee any challenge and remaining well within those limits in 2016 and beyond. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to remain in the high 4x in 2016 with some fluctuations based on quarterly cadence. We continue to remain committed to delevering into 3 to 4x range over time. 
In summary, as we rebase our outlook for our business, which is driven by the factors that Rajiv and Paul spoke to earlier, we remain committed to driving financial discipline including taking actions to improve gross margins, investing in growth drivers, becoming more efficient around G&A, continuing to improve our underlying tax rate, optimizing our cost of capital, driving improvements in working capital and improving after tax cash flows from operations to service our liabilities and for investments and future growth.

On Slide 39, you will see the corporate strategy as we laid it out in 2013 and the actions we took to rebuild the business over the past 3 years. We have successfully changed the structure, the businesses and the growth profile of Endo. Now given the evolving market conditions, it is time for us to continue to evolve our corporate strategy and transform the company for long-term durable growth. 
On Slide 40, let me talk about how we feel Endo is positioned for growth. Our aspiration to build the leading global specialty pharmaceutical company that improves lives and creates value has not changed. We are mindful, though, that we need to set appropriate medium-term goals reflecting current market conditions. This is meant rebasing of our financial guidance for 2016 and the reset of our previous expectations for 2017. However, our goals are clear, return to organic growth at levels above market averages; improved operating margins to be greater than 40%; and delever to between 3 to 4x. Three core areas of focus will enable these goals: growth in our branded business and the XIAFLEX pipeline; growth in our generics business and pipeline; and the ongoing optimization of our existing business.
Moving to Slide 41. There are many key growth drivers that strongly position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We know we have significant end market growth opportunities in both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to structure our team and our business to achieve that growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of legacy products. We are also accelerating our derisked innovative R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. 
As we execute this year, we will be achieving key milestones across our U.S. Branded business and we will keep you updated regarding our progress. On Slide 42, let's talk about the the durable portfolio pipeline we have in the U.S. generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated higher barrier to entry products like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs post restructuring. We have a diversified and important lead [indiscernible] based business and a robust highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they execute on these opportunities. 
Let's summarize on Slide 43. We have rebased our business and believe this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo. We have a clear plan to focus on strategic priorities: return to organic growth, margin improvement and delevering. Our key growth -- our key future growth drivers continue to provide promise to deliver against these strategic priorities. And perhaps, most importantly, Endo is a resilient organization and we are all committed to our future. Together, we will execute on our evolved corporate strategy and then achieve our goal to deliver products that improve patients' lives while creating value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me now turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period."

When we look at those big [indiscernible] in terms of specifically in the legacy Qualitest portfolio, we had challenges both in pain and related solid oral dosage in the immediate release portfolio. And what we're seeing was it was a combination of new competitors coming into the market that were established as well as just first-time players as well. So it's a combination of some smaller generic competitors entering the market that ultimately pushed the price down. And a lot of these occurrences were coming in the late March and April time frame. So in essence, it was several factors in terms of competition as well as loss of business. And clearly, on the FDA side, in terms of new competitors coming in and new approvals rather, I think what it could do if we're really starting to hit, we are going to see more players in some of these commodity-based products. But at the same time we have 150 products at the FDA. So you should also assume that we will also get the positive impact of a quicker approval.

We do see ourselves pushing that target from 3 to 4x from 2016 into 2017 or beyond. There are a number of moving parts that will help with that. Without getting specific guidance, some of the things I pointed to earlier is late in this year, we will build about $200 million of working capital. As far as the Seroquel and Zetia launch, that will be recovered in the first half of 2017 as we actually collect the cash on that revenue both in 2016. As we move into next year, we expect mesh gross payments to moderate down slightly. This year, we would see those mesh payments as being somewhere between $800 million to $900 million. Next year, we would predict that, that would be somewhere around $600 million. So we should see a step-down in gross mesh payments into next year. And then the other big drivers are on capital expenditures. We do see a step-up this year as part of the integration of [indiscernible] Qualitest primarily around the implementation of ERP systems that should moderate down in 2017. And then we could see a slight step-up in the contingent consideration line that I've outlined here for '16 primarily due to the 505(b)(2) products that Paul has spoken to as well [indiscernible] so there's a couple of moving parts that can kind of help you shape where '17 cash might be. But again, we do expect, over time, to delever back with that 3 to 4x range."

Now in terms of the things that have gone wrong this year, right, so you're right. We had several things that have not gone our way, and many of those things -- actually all of those things have played out over the course of the last 4 to 6 weeks, right, in the second half of March and in early April. But I'll point to the 3 things that have happened, right, the 3 materials that have happened. First one is the earlier-than-expected launch of the Voltaren generic. So we clearly didn't see it coming as early as it did. We have forecasted it towards the very, very back end of this year at worst and best case into 2017. Now that being said, we knew that there was going to be a generic for Voltaren Gel at some point, right? And in fact, the newly revised agreement with GSK and Novartis give us the right to an authorized generic. So we will have a tail of that product going through 2017 and beyond. So yes, there was bad news. It was earlier than expected, but it's not something that fundamentally impacts the longer-term growth trajectory. The second event that Paul referred towards is the delay in the 505(b)(2) programs. And again, expectation, while it is bad news for 2016 is that it does, in fact, manifest itself in 2017 and will in fact benefit '17 as well as '18 depending on when the FDA have really [indiscernible]. So then it comes down to the Qualitest base business [indiscernible] going to let Paul pick it up. Basically, what we've seen is a real reset in Q1, and Paul talked about the impact of the consortiums, the confluence of competitors that came in, for example, of bigger products like the 325 milligram [indiscernible] product, which is Qualitest's largest product that happened post -- mid-March. All of those things have happened in a way that has reset that business. And the way that we have thought about the guidance is that we've clearly taken a view of saying, how do we predict this erosion continuing to this year. So we do see continuation through this year. But by the same token, and Paul will elaborate on this, [indiscernible] as we go into 2017, continuous erosion in this base business will moderate to what you would typically see in a commoditized generic business, and the future really is about the pipeline and segments like this, the sterile injectable segment. So with that, let me just turn it to sort of Paul. Maybe you could talk a bit about our confidence about the remainder of the year and the moving parts going into '17."

With that, we are transferring the strategy from that high-volume throughput that historically had successes on economies of scale to the more Par legacy success model of high-value products where we're having more technically challenging products, things that are more difficult to make. Now the first thing we have to do, we talked about the restructuring, right? So we need to take the portfolio, we've got to rightsize it, we've got to be real smart about product selection and what we're going to continue to set in the market. We're making some very, very difficult decisions impacting some very talented people in our Charlotte -- in our Huntsville facility. That's been very difficult for all of us. That's the starting point, to focus on the restructuring plan, and it gets back down to our core values of operational execution, something that we are really driving home at Par. Rajiv talked about it already. The pipeline is where we're going to be able to reset ourselves. Ultimately, 75% of our value coming is from 2 products. Fourth quarter, we've talked quite a bit about [indiscernible] Zetia, I'm not going to spend a lot of time there. But we have to execute on the entire portfolio. And at the same time, we've got to continue to repopulate the products as we launch them. So that, coupled with, again, got to get the 505(b)(2), and we have other 505(b)(2)s across the portfolio. It's not just the 2 that we're referring to, but we need to execute. We have a path forward, we have a good strategy. I think these are areas that are going to help us ultimately stabilize our base. And at the same time, we can't lose focus on our service levels and our quality and continue with diversification of our portfolio."

It is disappointing for the company and personally disappointing for myself as well. So we have done an exhaustive assessment over the course of the last few weeks to ensure that we put as much thought as possible into how we assess the remainder of the year. And I would say, our guidance range for the full year is a realistic range, right? So no business is without its risks, and I think you know that. But we have taken a substantial downward division in the base business in generics. We have, and I commented on how we are treating Voltaren Gel. We have also taken the opportunity to address some other parts of our branded business because of the continued pressure in the pain market. We rebase some of those products as well. So we've really taken the opportunity to take a hard look at the forecast in this rebasing. So we don't take this lightly. I mean it's not something that we want to do more than once, right? So that's the post that we've taken. We are confident in this guided range, and we have a team that is going to work extremely hard at executing against this range. But as always [indiscernible] that there is always risk. And then yes one second.

So certainly, that is the last -- what's happened with the business over the course of the last few weeks and months is a disappointment and a setback. But I would point out that our future growth drivers remain unscathed in terms of these particular events that we talked about, right? So we point to XIAFLEX, the XIAFLEX pipeline. We talked to BELBUCA, which even though there is potential delay in terms of the launch trajectory of their product, we continue to believe in the future of that product. And the Par pipeline, which is the primary driver of that acquisition, is as robust as ever, right? It continues to grow. The sterile injectables business is robust and growing, and I have very confidence in Paul and the team in terms of getting the generics business back on track. So from that standpoint, we believe that in the hands of our management team, with the appropriate rebasing that we've done in 2016, that there is a path to returning to organic growth, improving our margins and delevering and, therefore, to creating shareholder value going forward. Having said, we are also being very clear that our board is a shareholder-friendly board. And if there's ever any strategic alternative that presents itself, our board will of course evaluate it."

Our Phase IIb trial is in the clinic and [indiscernible] recruiting patients. We feel positive about that, and we've also seen that we have increased confidence in being able to move forward, at least 4 other indications into the clinic, right? and they fall generally into the areas of aesthetics as well as other therapeutic indications around oncology. So the one core priority for us is continued and increased investment in that R&D pipeline. The pain market, clearly, in terms of public policy and relative pressures have increased in their market. As we said before, BELBUCA has a real profile that could really benefit in terms of some of the current concerns around schedule 2 opioid, as we do think there's a future there. But as we look further out into the future, building on our portfolio across our branded business, we could see ourselves in multiple areas that have similar characteristics to other specialty areas where I would say with a smaller focus [indiscernible] some main footprint that we can be successful and following some of the therapeutic areas where XIAFLEX is going to get us to is going to be the best way for us to pursue that. Now leading to your next question, in terms of cash and our priorities for using the cash, as Suky explained what we talked about delevering, we do expect to continue to prioritize delevering and be lowering back to the 3 to 4x is an important goal for us. That is delayed from 2016 into 2017 but continues to be an important goal for us. At the same time, investing in R&D pipeline both in XIAFLEX as well as Par are going to be very important priorities for us, which we will balance as we go, right? So those are going to be the most important uses of cash. And beyond that, obviously, once we get into a position where we have excess cash and have the opportunity to look at perhaps bolt-on acquisitions either for the generics business or the branded business, we will certainly look at those as they come up. [indiscernible] be to do so in the branded space, but that is the way [indiscernible]. We want to make sure that we execute against our growth plan and delever as our primary priorities, and we always keep the option of returning cash to shareholders as an alternative as well. Now let me just turn this to sort of Paul because I want him to talk to you about some of the new areas that we might expand our pipeline into as well as question that you had on product rationalization and the profitability impact of that."

But as you look at legacy Par and as part of normal course, it really is an evolution where you need to consistently look at your portfolio. You have to make some tough decisions, you have to take your unprofitable products or products that you're feeling pain and pressure on. That being said we're the fourth largest generic company. We are incredibly relevant. We will continue to be relevant in the industry, and I want to make that statement. When you -- if you want to be able to compete with the 4 large consortiums, add Walmart in, those 5 companies representing in excess of 90% share, you really need a well-balanced portfolio. And what I mean by that is you need your fair share of Paragraph IVs, you need to [indiscernible] technically changing solid oral dosage products. You need injectable products and you do need commodities that are profitable. So that's going to be very important to us in terms of the Qualitest portfolio on a go-forward basis.

And it's difficult to predict exactly when the inflection point is going to be, but what I can say is that the anecdotal feedback and the qualitative feedback from physicians have been very positive, and I myself have spent time in the field. And the fact that this is a schedule 3 product, despite all the new pressure that is on physicians with the new CDC guidelines and everything else, the message resonates, right? But that being said, from the very beginning, we pointed to something that would likely lead to requiring more time to educate physicians, and that is the tapering and titration required with this product, right? So to the extent that you are trying to move a patient from other therapy on to BELBUCA, you could taper that patient down per our label and then titrate the patient back up. And then for most physicians, what they are trying to do is to figure out their own gut feel for how this works. Clearly, from a promotional standpoint, we have to stand behind what's in the label, but every physician will figure out what he or she is comfortable with. I would also say, another encouraging sign is that repeat prescription from those who prescribed is progressing very well. So we have as many repeat prescriptions now as we have with new RX. These are all good indicators. I'm going to hesitate to give you an exact time frame of when there's going to be an inflection point, but I would point to the second half of this year in terms of when we would expect to see a continued improvement, and I've forgotten the second part of your question, yes it is on the managed care. So it is progressing very well. As we have said before, we have roughly about 2/3 of commercial lives covered at least with default coverage. We made very good progress in terms of converting the default coverage into actual coverage. Many of the plans require -- have confidentiality agreements that prevent us from talking about these things in a public way but one that we can point to where we have permission to talk about is Express Scripts. That has been very good win for us. We're continuing our discussions with other plans. And so far there has -- it's going exactly as we had expected. Now the one piece that we would expect to not get to until 2017 is the Medicare Part D coverage, but that is on par with all of the situations, better product launches midyear. We've also implemented a copay program that basically puts a product on par with comparative products. So from all aspects, from an access standpoint we are making good progress."

In certain projects, we are unable to do that.

However, there are other things that we would be working towards that, at this point in time, I would not want to disclose for competitive reasons but we are hopeful that this is not going to be a 1 year and out type of 505(b)(2), whereby we spend the requisite PDUFA fees, build up a product and then invite competition.

And then second, with respect to XIAFLEX, how should we think about that product sales sequentially in coming quarters?

And then we talked about V Gel, which we fully expect it to be genericized as we headed into 2017.

We will have to take a view on exactly how BELBUCA is going to do. It all depends on kind of where the inflection point is going to be. Obviously, tailwinds behind XIAFLEX will continue to grow. We will know more by the middle of this year in terms of what's happening in OPANA. We have a July 29 PDUFA date for our ADF [indiscernible] request with the FDA. And we will also know more in terms of some of the other pipeline launches and other programs that Paul's pursuing in the Par business and exactly where they will fall in 2017, right? So those are some of the real moving parts we have. We also signal that we expect to increase our R&D spend, particularly behind the XIAFLEX pipeline. And to the extent that Paul has any new ideas from an R&D standpoint, we will try very hard to meet any additional funding requirements in the Par pipeline as well.

On the next 2 slides, you will see a brief agenda and an outline of key themes for today's call. To begin, I will provide a snapshot of our first quarter financial results which, despite some headwinds, were largely in line with our expectations. However, these headwinds have created substantial challenges to overcome in the remainder of the year. We are providing revised full year 2016 guidance today to reflect these challenges. We will spend some additional time discussing the state of our business, key drivers for this rebasing and our action plans moving forward. 
Specifically, there are 3 factors to call out that we will discuss in more detail on today's call: deeper-than-expected erosion in the legacy Qualitest business; delays in FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products; and an earlier-than-expected generic entrant for Voltaren Gel. Importantly, we will also talk about why we believe that our core growth drivers will continue to provide opportunities to execute against our strategic plan and allow us to return to organic growth, improve margins and delever in the medium term.

This growth was offset in part by a decline in Voltaren Gel due to that product's loss of exclusivity in March and continued pressure on the pain market. In our generic segment, the base business erosion continued into the first quarter and was significantly deeper than we expected at approximately 30%. This was driven by continued pricing and competitive pressures on our commoditized and pain products. The erosion was partially offset by strong performance from our sterile injectables portfolio, including Vasostrict, and the overall performance of the legacy Par portfolio. We will return to these themes when we discuss full year guidance. 
The international business performed as expected with a modest decline in reported revenues. However, our emerging markets businesses continued to show both constant exchange rate revenue growth and underlying growth as well as margin expansion. 
On Slide 7, you will see our first quarter segment revenues as well as reported and underlying growth. 
Next, on Slide 8, we provided our first quarter financial results. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let's talk about the state of our business and the context in which we are viewing the remainder of 2016. To best understand where Endo is now, it's important to also understand where we've been and what we've built. When I joined the company in 2013, we chartered a new strategic cause and outlined some very clear goals as seen here in the left column. Over the next 3 years, we set out to achieve these goals and position Endo for growth. That strategy is still core to Endo and to how we run our business. However, what has become clear is that the 2016 specialty pharmaceutical landscape and market forces require an evolution of that strategy. 
So let's talk about our path forward. Our goal has not changed. We continue to aspire to build a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company. What has changed rapidly is the landscape and market environment within which we are operating, particularly in generics. What does this mean going forward? It means we're reshaping the path forward for Endo. We are rebasing expectations for the business and are evolving our current strategy to meet challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Ultimately, we are positioning the company for long-term organic and diversified growth, margin improvement and delevering. 
So let me now turn the call over to Paul to discuss key factors and drivers related to generics. Paul?"

Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying and actual sales. The",1675,"Thank you, Rajiv, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying and actual sales. The variances between the sales totals resulted from a greater-than-anticipated erosion and base business of approximately 30%, driven particularly by the legacy Qualitest portfolio. While we expected base erosion to be higher in the first quarter than the full year, the actual erosion was much deeper across our pain portfolio and other commoditized products than originally anticipated. By contrast, the legacy Par portfolio is performing on track with internal expectations. Our sterile injectables product portfolio continued its strong performance with 86% growth over Q1 2015. Our new launches and alternative dosage product portfolio performance was stable and largely unchanged year-over-year. 
So let's discuss the factors that impacted these Q1 results and that we believe will shape our full year generics performance. Moving to Slide 14. There are rapidly changing market conditions that have affected both the broader generic sector and Par. First, we've seen a steep and rapid price erosion caused by payer consolidation that has been more even profound than anticipated. Its effect has exceeded what might have been expected from an ordinary downturn in the industry's traditional pricing cycle. The impact has been particularly acute in the more commodity like product categories, such as our pain and controlled substances portfolio and our immediate-release solid oral dosage forms. 
Second, coupled with this consolidation and new payer environment, competitors are taking aggressive pricing actions to gain market share. Examples include both the 300 and 325 milligrams strength of hydrocodone APAP, butalbital, morphine sulfate and oxycodone. 
Third, there's been a rapid erosion of the pain segment, driven by 3 things: one, continued market contraction; two, increased competitive capacity and pressure; and three, while still too early to judge the full impact, we believe the recently issued CDC guidelines will continue to put pressure on an already soft pain market. As you may know, approximately 40% of the legacy Qualitest portfolio was comprised of pain products, so this sector's specific weakness has had a disproportionate effect on our generics business. Fourth, there's been a recent and marked acceleration of FDA approval for generic products. While we'll ultimately expect this to also benefit the Par portfolio and our own pending submissions over time, the approvals in launches seen in late Q1 and in April of this year have resulted in greater competitive pressure for our products. Fifth and finally, delays in expected FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products means that we have yet to see the anticipated removal of unapproved competitive products from the market. Correspondingly, we have yet to achieve the market exclusivity that we expected for these products. It's important to note that we still expect these FDA actions but now on a delayed time line. The removal of relevant unapproved products may not occur before first half of 2017 versus our original expectation of early 2016. 
Now that we've talked about what's happened in the generics market, let's also take a few minutes to review when some of these events surfaced, thereby impacting our generic business. In 2016, it's important to note that the U.S. generic landscape has continued to shift, with significant events and updates as recently as late March and April. In fact, it was not until late March that we confirmed the delays on the regulatory actions related to our 505(b)(2) products that I just mentioned. Then in April alone, we see at least 5 competitive product approvals and additional market entrants. Finally, we've also just completed our consortium bid cycle with a more negative output and an increased pricing pressure than we anticipated. 
Moving to Slide 16. I do want to take a few moments to discuss our ongoing integration of the Qualitest and Par businesses. Last fall and Q1 of this year, we were conducting an integration of 2 complex generic businesses. What became very clear to those of us who have been in the generic industry for some time is that the legacy Par operating model is better positioned to address the challenges of today's evolving market. As a result, we set out to shift the legacy Qualitest portfolio strategy from a high-volume approach to the high-value operating model long practiced by legacy Par. As part of the integration activities, we're also transitioning the legacy Qualitest systems and processes to the Par business platform. The legacy Par systems offer more real-time and product level data, allowing for faster analysis and reaction within a challenging and changing market. While many of these improvements were already planned at Qualitest, the integration of our business will accelerate the benefits. 
Next on Slide 17. Let's talk about what we're doing to address these challenges and best position our generic business moving forward, our action plan. First, we are continuing to maximize our key growth drivers, such as our sterile injectables portfolio, led by Vasostrict and approximately 30 new products we expect to launch this year. Next, our platform for long-term organic growth is our R&D pipeline. We are continuing to advance these more than 250 projects post reprice [indiscernible] and anticipate filing 25 to 30 new submissions in 2016 alone. We are also accelerating the implementation of an optimization and restructuring of our product portfolio and manufacturing facility network. I'll talk more about this restructuring shortly. Additionally, we are accelerating the move of legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform. This is already substantially complete as our commercial insight and forecasting capabilities have been fully transitioned. Finally, critical to our action plan is our ability to execute. This is not the first turbulent market environment that the Par team has successfully navigated. Our team is seasoned, capable and prudent. 
Moving to Slide 18. Now permit me to provide some additional detail on the restructuring I mentioned earlier. Most importantly, this restructuring is an acceleration of our ongoing integration and broader optimization efforts designed to prioritize and grow high-value durable assets. It is entirely consistent with all our integration activities to date. The restructuring will affect our manufacturing sites in Charlotte and in Huntsville and will result in more than 60 product discontinuations. In addition, we are pruning less value-driven R&D projects so that we can prioritize our investments on differentiated and high-value projects. We expect that the restructuring will be completed by the third quarter of 2017 and will result in a total of approximately $60 million in annualized net run rate savings by Q4 of 2017. We expect to see about $10 million of that gross margin improvement this year. As a result, shortly, we will begin the process and informing employees about these changes. As part of that effort, approximately 740 employees will be impacted under a phased transition. For Endo, the Par management team and for me personally, this is both an extremely disappointing to our company. We value our people, and for those who will be affected, we thank you all for what you've contributed to Endo. We'll be providing resources to help manage through this difficult transition. 
And while change is never easy, it is necessary to better position our generics division to successfully compete in the U.S. generics market. So on Slide 19. Let's talk about our full year revenue outlook for the generic segment. We have previously expected a mid-teens underlying growth rate for the business. Given the erosion now forecasted across the sector and particularly for our base business and the delay in regulatory action related to our 505(b)(2) products, offset by the strong growth projected for our sterile injectables and new launches and alternative dosage portfolios, we now expect underlying growth for our generics business to be in the low single digit percentage range. We do expect that erosion on our base business to moderate back to rates typical for the generic industry beyond 2016. The erosion in 2016 is expected to be more acute than historical trends due to our relative pricing and share levels in the pain markets prior to the observed and expected erosion. 
Moving to Slide 20. You'll see a look at our Q1 2016 reported generic net sales annualized versus our full year 2016 guidance midpoint. You can see the projected decline due to non-face business competitive entries and base erosion, which we expect to be approximately 5 years per quarter through the end of the year. Our new product launches are a significant driver of growth as illustrated by the green block and bring you to our projected generic net sales midpoint for the year. 
Now let's look at our 2016 launches on Slide 21. We are on track to launch nearly 30 new products this year. 4 of these are first-to-file products including our generic Seroquel and generic Zetia products that will launch in the fourth quarter of 2016. Another 2 launch products are alternate dosages and another 9 are sterile injectables. Importantly, and as an illustration of our value-focused strategy and platform, nearly 1/3 of our projected launches are products that will be exclusive or faced only one generic competitor. Finally, let's close this generics discussion with a quick review of our robust R&D pipeline on Slide 22. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have more than 250 projects in our reprioritized R&D pipeline. We anticipate launching more than 100 of them between 2016 and 2019, representing a total current market value of nearly $30 billion. Our pipeline is robust, diversified and populated by higher barrier-to-entry and higher margin generic products. We believe that positions us strongly for future growth. I am confident in our platform and I believe that our pipeline is truly differentiated. I know that our team has the experience and the ability to address these challenges and to deliver future generics growth and margin expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Rajiv for a discussion on our branded business. Rajiv?"

Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our U.S. Branded business. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Lortie, President U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, who will be leaving us to pursue other opportunities. Brian has been a critical part of the efforts to reposition our company over the last 3 years. We will miss him at Endo and wish him well in his future endeavors. 
Moving to Slide 24. Let's talk about factors affecting our U.S. Branded business. First, there has been a recent generic entrant for our Voltaren Gel product. This generic came into the market earlier than we expected, and it has affected our 2016 outlook for V Gel. Second, we have seen increasing pressure on our branded pain segment. This includes additional competitive entries as well as a continually increasing number of public policy and regulatory actions, such as the recent CDC guidelines around opioid prescribing end-use. Additionally, there are reimbursement restrictions now in place for LIDODERM further limiting the use of that branded product. Against this backdrop, we do continue to see significant growth potential in our differentiated product, BELBUCA. However, it has progressed at a slower pace than we initially expected due to pain market pressures. That said, we continue to believe in the future of this product as a scheduled 3 alternative in the opioid category. 
On Slide 25, you will see the opportunity for BELBUCA, the first and only buprenorphine Buccal Film for chronic pain management which we launched in late February of this year. There are about 90 million total prescriptions written for the treatment of chronic pain below 160 milligram morphine sulfate equivalents or MSCs. BELBUCA is well positioned to source patients both from short-acting opioids as well as other long-acting opioids. Given the size of both these segments, even with a relatively small share of the available prescription base, BELBUCA could become a very meaningful product in this category. 
It is also important to note that even in these early days, BELBUCA is not only capturing switches from LAOs but also from SAOs and new therapy starts. Further, we have seen an increasing number of repeat prescriptions week over week. Its differentiated profile is resonating well with physicians and patients across the spectrum, and our early feedback on access, ease of use, efficacy and side effect profile have all been positive. 
Along these lines, let's look at Slide 26, to talk more about early progress on the BELBUCA launch. There are 3 areas that we have focused on in terms of early launch, traction and feedback. While I won't talk through each bullet here, we did want to provide a comprehensive look at where we are making progress and where we see opportunities to further accelerate BELBUCA launch traction. 
Next, on Slide 27, let's talk about XIAFLEX. XIAFLEX continues its double-digit demand growth profile, and we are making good progress in growing that business. We see a significant opportunity to expand both our share of the current treatment market as well as the size of the overall markets for both Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Across both of the DC and PD indications, we have new initiatives focused on driving growth. We are working to broaden our active injector base and have improved targeting to reach the most appropriate positions. Our DTC and print ad campaign efforts are also showing signs of real traction. For example, visitors to the ""Ask About the Curve"" website spend about 10x longer on the site than an average website visit, and about 1 in 10 visitors click through to find the Peyronie's disease specialist in the area. 
We have also worked to improve convenience of physicians through our reimbursement support initiatives and our product savings program. Overall, these efforts position XIAFLEX for strong continued growth. We expect mid- to high teens percentage growth in 2016.
Moving to Slide 28. Let's talk about the other driver for XIAFLEX growth over the long term, our robust R&D pipeline. We see significant opportunity and substantial value for XIAFLEX across both therapeutic and aesthetic indications and have talked about how the product could be a $1 billion franchise for Endo by the mid-2020s. That opportunity is driven by the more than 12 potential indications currently in the R&D pipeline and the multiple additional programs in even earlier stages of development. As part of our evolved corporate strategy and initiatives to return to organic growth, we are accelerating our R&D programs for XIAFLEX and plan to move 5 programs into the clinic even earlier than previously expected in 2016. It is a time of significant opportunity for these growth drivers in our branded business. We have taken steps to best seize those opportunities and accelerate their growth, while also managing the legacy products within our portfolio. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss our full year 2016 financial guidance. Suky?"

On Slide 3",320,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. In an effort to provide you with more clarity, we are providing additional details on how the factors and market conditions that Paul and Rajiv discussed will impact Endo through the rest of 2016. On Slide 30, we have provided an outline of the key components of change to our rebased revenue guidance that lead to an 11% reduction. As you can see, the largest driver of the change is the greater-than-expected erosion in our generics-based business. As a reminder, we define base generics as extended release, immediate release and pain and controlled substance products. As with the branded business, our rest of the year projections are based on business and commercial assessment and recent trend announcements at a product-by-product level that also takes into account the outcomes of recent bid cycles and competitive actions. 
Approximately 55% of the decline is related to price erosion and 45% relates to volume declines. This is an important variable as price declines fall to margin at 100%. I should also note, we expect to realize the value of delayed 505(b)(2) actions later in 2017. 
Next, on Slide 31, let's look at the drivers for the changes in our projected gross margin for 2016. Our previous guidance was 63% to 65% for the full year. Given the impacts of key events and market factors, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 60%. Using the midpoint of the previous and revised guidance range, we expect gross margins to decline about 17% versus prior expectations. We are projecting a disproportionally high erosion on gross margin versus revenue due to a number of factors that you will see detailed here in the blue call-out box. Importantly, we do expect to realize gross margin for our 505(b)(2) products in 2017, and we expect to offset the 2016 underabsorption through rationalization efforts into 2017."

We have provided a bridge from our previous EPS expectations for the full year through our revised guidance. The reduction in EPS reflect the revenue and gross margin drivers that I've just discussed. We've taken actions to help offset the declines we are projecting. In 2016, we are reducing OpEx across SG&A while remaining focused on prioritized investments against growth drivers and accelerating our branded R&D programs, and we project improvement in our tax rate. Lastly, we are taking actions to improve our gross margin profile through the planned rationalization that Paul covered earlier. 
On Slide 33, you will see our 2016 financial outlook by business segment including expected, reported and underlying growth rates and gross margins across the portfolio. The branded business growth rate reflects the loss of exclusivity of V Gel. The generics outlook reflects the declines in the base business and the delayed regulatory actions that were discussed earlier. And international is broadly in line with previous expectations. 
Next, on Slide 34, we have outlined our full revised 2016 financial guidance. From a cadence perspective, we continue to see revenues and EPS weighted to the second half of the year, driven by the launches from the Par portfolio and continued growth from XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We now expect approximately 46% of revenues and 39% of full year EPS in the first half of 2016. This implies a sequential step-down in Q2 due to a number of drivers including the full quarter impact of recently launched generic competitors that we talked about earlier on the call. In addition, we expect a ramp-up in spending in the second quarter primarily related to our acceleration of R&D programs and commercial efforts in U.S. Branded. We have talked through the moving parts around revenues and gross margin. We expect interest expense to continue to be about $455 million. Our tax rate will be lower due to continued progress around planning strategies and due to a lower mix of U.S. sourced income while maintaining static debt benefits and acquired attributes. Depending on the nature and timing of potential discrete items, the cadence of tax rate through the year can be lumpy. Consistent with prior commentary, we do expect to step up in our tax rate in outer years. We now project that rate to be in the high single digits. 
Next on Slide 35. While our first quarter cash flow from operations was negative, it was impacted by a number of items that we consider to be noncore. After considering these items, underlying cash flow from operations continues to be well correlated to adjusted net income. I will also note that our working capital metrics are in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarter, we have provided more details around working capital in the appendix of this presentation. 
Moving to Slide 36. It is important to note that we continue to project robust cash from operations prior to legal-related cash flows. I will note that in early Q2, we received the full tax refund that we pointed to earlier in the year. Ultimately, we expect to use remaining cash to pay down approximately $250 million to $300 million in debt in 2016. 
Finally, on Slide 37, let me provide you with a snapshot of our liquidity profile. This is important because our cash position and liquidity ratios remained strong and well within our covenants as defined under our debt agreements. We do not foresee any challenge in remaining well within those limits in 2016 and beyond. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to remain in the high 4x in 2016 with some fluctuations based on quarterly cadence. We continue to remain committed to delevering into 3 to 4x range over time. 
In summary, as we rebased our outlook for our business, which is driven by the factors that Rajiv and Paul spoke to earlier, we remain committed to driving financial discipline, including taking actions to improve gross margins, investing in growth drivers, becoming more efficient around G&A, continuing to improve our underlying tax rate, optimizing our cost of capital, driving improvements in working capital and improving after tax cash flows from operations to service our liabilities and for investments in future growth.

We have successfully changed the structure, the businesses and the growth profile of Endo. Now, given the evolving market conditions, it is time for us to continue to evolve our corporate strategy and transform the company for long-term durable growth. 
On Slide 40, let me talk about how we feel Endo is positioned for growth. Our aspiration to build a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company that improves lives and creates value has not changed. We are mindful, though, that we need to set appropriate medium-term goals reflecting current market conditions. This has meant rebasing of our financial guidance for 2016 and a reset of our previous expectations for 2017. However, our goals are clear, return to organic growth at levels above market averages; improved operating margins to be greater than 40%; and delever to between 3 to 4x. 3 core areas of focus will enable these goals: growth in our branded business and the XIAFLEX pipeline; growth in our generics business and pipeline; and the ongoing optimization of our existing business.
Moving to Slide 41. There are many key growth drivers that strongly position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We know we have significant in-market growth opportunities in both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to structure our team and our business to achieve that growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of legacy products. We are also accelerating our derisked innovative R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. 
As we execute this year, we will be achieving key milestones across our U.S. Branded business and we will keep you updated regarding our progress. On Slide 42, let's talk about the durable portfolio and pipeline we have in our U.S. generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated higher barrier-to-entry products, like sterile injectables, and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs post restructuring. We have a diversified and importantly reset based business and a robust highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they execute on these opportunities. 
Let's summarize on Slide 43. We have rebased our business and believe this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo. We have a clear plan to focus on strategic priorities: a return to organic growth, margin improvement and delevering. Our key growth -- our key future growth drivers continue to provide promise to deliver against these strategic priorities. And perhaps, most importantly, Endo is a resilient organization, and we are all committed to our future. Together, we will execute on our evolved corporate strategy and then achieve our goal to deliver products that improve patients' lives while creating value for our shareholders.

We do see ourselves pushing that target from 3 to 4x from 2016 into 2017 or beyond. There are a number of moving parts that will help with that. Without giving specific guidance, some of the things I've pointed to earlier is, late in this year, we will build about $200 million of working capital. As far as the Seroquel and Zetia launch, that will be recovered in the first half of 2017 as we actually collect the cash on that revenue booked in 2016. As we move into next year, we expect mesh gross payments to moderate down slightly. This year, we would see those mesh payments as being somewhere between $800 million to $900 million. Next year, we would predict that, that would be somewhere around $600 million. So we should see a step-down in gross mesh payments into next year. And then the other big drivers are on capital expenditures. We do see a step-up this year as part of the integration of Par and Qualitest primarily around the implementation of ERP systems that should moderate down in 2017. And then we could see a slight step-up in the contingent consideration line that I've outlined here for '16 primarily due to the 505(b)(2) products that Paul has spoken to as well as V Gel. So there's a couple of moving parts that can kind of help you shape where '17 cash might be. But again, we do expect, over time, to delever back into that 3 to 4x range."

Now in terms of the things that have gone wrong this year, right, so you're right. We've had several things that have not gone our way, and many of those things -- actually all of those things have played out over the course of the last 4 to 6 weeks, right, in the second half of March and in early April. But I'll point to the 3 things that have happened, right, so the 3 material things that have happened. First one is the earlier-than-expected launch of the Voltaren Gel generic. So we clearly didn't see it coming as early as it did. We had forecasted it towards the very, very back end of this year at worst and best case into 2017. Now that being said, we knew that there was going to be a generic for Voltaren Gel at some point, right, so -- and in fact, the newly revised agreement with GSK and Novartis give us the right to an authorized generic, so we will have a tail of that product going through 2017 and beyond. So yes, that was bad news. It was earlier than expected, but not something that fundamentally impacts our longer-term growth trajectory. The second event that Paul referred to was this delay in the 505(b)(2) programs. And again, our expectation, while it is bad news for 2016 is that it does, in fact, manifest itself from 2017 and will in fact benefit '17 as well as '18 depending on when the FDA have actually asked. So then it comes down to the Qualitest base business, right, and I'm going to let Paul pick it up. But basically what we've seen is a real reset in Q1, and Paul talked about the impact of the consortiums, the confluence of competitors that came in for some of our bigger products, like the 325 milligram Hydro-APAP product, which is Qualitest's largest product that happened post -- mid-March. All of those things have happened in a way that has reset that business. And the way we have thought about the guidance is that we've clearly taken a view of saying, how do we predict this erosion continuing through this year, right. So we do see continued erosion through this year. But by the same token, and Paul will elaborate on this, our view is that as we go into 2017, the continued erosion in this base business will moderate to what you would typically see in a commoditized generic business, and the future really is about the pipeline and segments like the sterile injectable segment, right. So with that, let me just turn it over to Paul. Maybe you can talk a bit about our confidence about the remainder of the year and the moving parts going into '17."

So Chris, your question is really on stabilization and really why do we think it's going to get better. I think the first thing that we want to talk about is, is that, historically, we've had successes with the Qualitest portfolio, but we've got a call what it is. It is a mature portfolio that is susceptible to competition. With that, we are transferring the strategy from that high-volume throughput that, historically, had successes on economies of scale to the more Par legacy success model of high-value products, where we're having more technically-challenging products, things that are more difficult to make. Now the first thing we have to do, we talked about the restructuring, right? So we need to take the portfolio. We've got to rightsize it. We've got to be real smart about product selection and what we're going to continue to sell in the market. We're making some very, very difficult decisions impacting some very talented people in our Huntsville facility. That's been very difficult for all of us. So that's the starting point: to focus on the restructuring plan. And it gets back down to our core values of operational execution, something that we are really driving home at Par. Rajiv talked about it already. The pipeline is where we're going to be able to reset ourselves. Ultimately, 75% of our value coming is from 2 products. Fourth quarter, we've talked quite a bit about quetiapine and Zetia. I'm not going to spend a lot of time there. But we have to execute on the entire portfolio, and at the same time, we've got to continue to repopulate the products as we launch them. So that, coupled with -- again, got to get the 505(b)(2)s, and we have other 505(b)(2)s across the portfolio. It's not just the 2 that we're referring to, but we need to execute. We have a path forward. We have a good strategy. I think these are areas that are going to help us ultimately stabilize our base, and at the same time, we can't lose focus on our service levels and our quality and continue with diversification of our portfolio."

How much of that $60 million -- how much of the product rationalization is part of that commoditized business? And once that gets out, how do you see gross margins recovering after this?"

I think other drivers to think about into 2017 as we continue to grow the Par portfolio, which we see as one with products with a margin profile above the existing gross margin average, we could see improvement from that driver. And then in addition, as we see growth from branded within XIAFLEX as well as BELBUCA, we would also see those as potentially expanding margins into 2017. So again, we're not in a position to provide a full 2017 or beyond guidance, but we do see a path to recover in gross margins above where 2016 are going to land."

It is disappointing for the company, and personally, disappointing for myself as well. So we have done an exhaustive assessment over the course of the last few weeks to ensure that we put as much thought as possible into how we assess the remainder of the year. And I would say, our guidance range for the full year is a realistic range, right? So no business is without its risks, and I think you know that. But we have taken a substantial downward division in the base business in generics. We have -- and I commented on how we are treating Voltaren Gel. We've also taken the opportunity to address some other parts of our branded business because of the continued pressure in the pain market that we rebase some of those products as well. So we've really taken the opportunity to take a hard look at the forecast in this rebasing, right? So we don't take this lightly. I mean, it's not something that we want to do more than once, right? So that's the push that we have taken. We are confident in this guidance range, and we have a team that is going to work extremely hard at executing against this range. But as always, since I already point, that there is always risk. And then -- yes, one second. So Louise, I was also just going to answer the second question you asked. So for us and our Board of Directors, our goal is longer-term shareholder value creation, right? So certainly, that is -- the last -- the -- what's happened with the business over the course of the last few weeks and months is a disappointment and a setback. But I would point out that our future growth drivers remain unscathed in terms of these particular events that we talked about, right? So we point to XIAFLEX, the XIAFLEX pipeline. We talked to BELBUCA, which, even though, there is, potentially, a delay in terms of the launch trajectory of their product, we continue to believe in the future of that product. And the Par pipeline, which is the primary driver of that acquisition, is robust as ever, right? It continues to grow. The sterile injectables business is robust and growing, and I have every confidence in Paul and the team in terms of getting the generics business back on track. So from that standpoint, we believe that in the hands of our management team, with the appropriate rebasing that we've done in 2016, that there is a path to returning to organic growth, improving our margins and delevering, and therefore, to creating shareholder value going forward. So having said, we are also being very clear that our board is a shareholder-friendly board. And if there is ever any strategic alternative that presents itself, our board will, of course, evaluate it."

Let me just take your 3 questions, and I will let Paul talk about the product rationalization question at the end. So from a long-term standpoint, I think what we continue to be very optimistic about is following the XIAFLEX pipeline",511,"So thank you, Andrew. Let me just take your 3 questions, and I will let Paul talk about the product rationalization question at the end. So from a long-term standpoint, I think what we continue to be very optimistic about is following the XIAFLEX pipeline, right? So we've pursued the cellulite indication. Our Phase IIb trial is in the clinic and currently recruiting patients. We feel positive about that. And you've also seen that we have increased confidence in being able to move forward, at least, 4 other indications into the clinic, right? And they fall generally into the areas of aesthetics as well as other therapeutic indications around that oncology nest. So the one core priority for us is continued and increased investment in that R&D pipeline. In the -- the pain market, clearly, in terms of public policy and regulatory pressures, is increasing their market. As we said before, BELBUCA has a real profile that could really benefit in terms of some of the current concerns around Schedule II opioids, so we do think there's a future there. But as we look further out into the future, building on our portfolio across our branded business, we could see ourselves in multiple areas that have similar characteristics to other specialty areas, where I would say with a smaller focus sales on marketing footprint that we can be successful. And following some of the therapeutic areas where XIAFLEX is going to get us to is going to be the best way for us to pursue that. Now leading to your next question, in terms of cash and our priorities for using the cash, as Suky explained when we talked about delevering, we do expect to continue to prioritize delevering and delevering back to the 3 to 4x is a important goal for us. Now that is delayed from 2016 into 2017 but continues to be an important goal for us. At the same time, investing in our R&D pipeline, both in XIAFLEX as well as Par, are going to be very important priorities for us, which we will balance as we go, right? So those are going to be the most important uses of cash. And beyond that, and obviously, once we get into a position where we have excess cash and have the opportunity to look at, perhaps, bolt-on acquisitions either for the generics business or the branded business, we will certainly look at those as they come up. Our preference would be to do so in the branded space, but that is the way out. We want to make sure that we execute against our growth plan and delever as our primary priorities, and we always keep the option of returning cash holder -- cash to shareholders as an alternative as well. Now let me just turn this over to Paul because I want him to talk to you about some of the new areas that we might expand the pipeline into as well as the question that you had on product rationalization and the profitability impact of that."

So obviously, a very important question, and I want to start by saying, this -- the decision in terms of the -- calling the portfolio, as I said, very, very difficult for us. But as you look at legacy Par and as part of normal course, it really is an evolution where you need to consistently look at your portfolio. You have to make some tough decisions. You have to take your unprofitable products or products that are -- you're feeling pain and pressure on. That being said, we're the fourth largest generic company. We are incredibly relevant. We will continue to be relevant in the industry, and I want to make that statement. And when you -- if you want to be able to compete with the 4 large consortiums, add Walmart in, those 5 companies representing in excess of 90% share, you really need a well-balanced portfolio. And what I mean by that is you need your fair share of Paragraph IVs. You need heart to make technically-challenging solid oral dosage products. You need injectable products, and you do need commodities that are profitable. So that's going to be very important to us in terms of the Qualitest portfolio on a go-forward basis. Now on discontinuation products, hard decisions. But by calling the portfolio areas that is going to help us, parts that are ultimately being sold at losses, and we make the tough decisions, it's going to help us on the cash side. It's -- we're going to have a reduction on our operating costs. We'll have a reduction on working capital, and we'll also not need to invest as much in certain facilities from a CapEx standpoint. So from that standpoint, generally speaking, high level, those would be areas that we would have savings in."

And the last week for which we have data, I think, is the week of April 21, and we had roughly 650 prescriptions. And we continue to see momentum, right? And it's difficult to predict exactly when the inflection point is going to be, but what I can say is that the anecdotal feedback and the qualitative feedback from physicians have been very positive. And I, myself, have spent time in the field. And the fact that this is a Schedule III product, despite all the new pressure that is on physicians with the new CDC guidelines and everything else, the message resonates, right? But that being said, from the very beginning, we pointed to something that would likely lead to requiring more time to educate physicians, and that is the tapering and titration required with this product, right? So to the extent that you are trying to move a patient from other therapy onto BELBUCA, you had to taper that patient down per our label and then titrate the patient back up. And for most physicians, what they are trying to do is to figure out their own gut feel for how this works. Clearly, from a promotional standpoint, we understand behind what's in the label, but every physician will figure out what he or she is comfortable with. I would also say another encouraging sign is that the repeat prescription from those who prescribed is progressing very well, so we have as many repeat prescriptions now as we have with new RX. So these are all good indicators. I'm going to hesitate to give you an exact time frame of when there's going to be an inflection point, but I would point to the second half of this year in terms of when we would expect to see a continued improvement in it. And I am afraid I've forgotten the second part of your question. Oh, yes, it was on the managed care. So it is progressing very well. As we have said before, we have roughly about 2/3 of commercial lives covered at least with default coverage. We made very good progress in terms of converting the default coverage into actual coverage. Many of the plans require -- have confidentiality agreements that prevent us from talking about these things in a public way. But one that we can point to, where we have permission to talk about, is Express Scripts. That has been a very good win for us. We are continuing our discussions with other plans. And so far, there has -- it's going exactly as we had expected. Now the one piece that we would expect to not get to until 2017 is the Medicare Part D coverage, but that is on par with the -- all of the situations, where our product launches midyear. We've also implemented a copay program that basically puts a product on par with comparative products. So in -- from all aspects, from an access standpoint we are making good progress."

So let's talk about what's changed when -- since we last put our expectations for 2017, right? So the 3 main changes have been a resetting of expectations for our Qualitest base business; the delay in the 505(b)(2) program, as we talked about, which is going out of 2016 but will be impacting positively 2017 and 2018 for that matter; and then we talked about V Gel, which we fully expect it to be genericized as we headed into 2017. It just happened much earlier than we expected. And we do have the authorized generic as an option for us to use going into 2017, right? So the real major downward revision there is the impact of the Qualitest base business. Now there are other moving parts that will impact what our final guidance for 2017 is, though, right? We will have to take a view on exactly how BELBUCA is going to do. It all depends on kind of where the inflection point is going to be. Obviously, tailwinds behind XIAFLEX will continue to grow. We will know more by the middle of this year in terms of what's happening at OPANA. We have a July 29 PDUFA date for our ADF relabeling request with the FDA. And we will also know more in terms of some of the other pipeline launches and other programs that Paul is pursuing in the Par business and exactly where they will fall in 2017, right? So those are the -- some of the real moving parts we have. We also signaled that we expect to increase our R&D spend, particularly behind the XIAFLEX pipeline. And to the extent that Paul has any new ideas from an R&D standpoint, we will try very hard to meet any additional funding requirements in that -- in the Par pipeline as well. So those are some of the moving parts. I don't know, Suky, whether you have -- there's anything else that you would point to?"

In 2013, we had 2 primary and declining assets at that time and a very fragmented base of business across health care solutions divided in pharmaceuticals. You fast forward to today, we've rebuilt our branded portfolio and pipeline, with the acquisition of Auxilium, in particular XIAFLEX. We've divested noncore businesses. We've achieved scale and differentiation in our generics portfolio with the addition of Par [indiscernible]. That is what the future is going to be about, particularly as we think to see they are rebasing of our legacy Qualitest business. 
We're establishing international structure and footprint for growth and expansion. We narrowed the mesh tail, and we have built a business generating significant EBITDA even after this rebasing and free cash flow that we expect to grow going forward.

On the next 2 slides, you will see a brief agenda and an outline of key themes for today's call. To begin, I will provide a snapshot of our first quarter financial results which, despite some headwinds, were largely in line with our expectations. However, these headwinds have created substantial challenges to overcome in the remainder of the year. We are providing revised full year 2016 guidance today to reflect these challenges. We will spend some additional time discussing the state of our business, key drivers for this rebasing and our action plans moving forward. 
Specifically, there are 3 factors to call out that we will discuss in more detail on today's call: deeper-than-expected erosion in the legacy Qualitest business; delays in FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products; and an earlier-than-expected generic entrant for Voltaren Gel. Importantly, we will also talk about why we believe that our core growth drivers will continue to provide opportunities to execute against our strategic plan and allow us to return to organic growth, improve margins and delever in the medium term. 
Before we begin, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome our 2 new board members on behalf of our board and the company. We are delighted that Doug and Todd have accepted our invitation to join. We look forward to their contributions. 
Moving to Slide 6, you will see the Q1 snapshot of reported segment revenues. In our branded business, we saw solid continued growth for XIAFLEX, which performed well despite the expected historical trend of Q1 seasonality. This growth was offset in part by a decline in Voltaren Gel due to that product's loss of exclusivity in March and continued pressure on the pain market. In our generic segment, the base business erosion continued into the first quarter and was significantly deeper than we expected at approximately 30%. This was driven by continued pricing and competitive pressures on our commoditized and pain products. The erosion was partially offset by strong performance from our sterile injectables portfolio, including Vasostrict, and the overall performance of the legacy Par portfolio. We will return to these themes when we discuss full year guidance. 
The international business performed as expected with a modest decline in reported revenues. However, our emerging markets businesses continued to show both constant exchange rate revenue growth and underlying growth as well as margin expansion. 
On Slide 7, you will see our first quarter segment revenues as well as reported and underlying growth. 
Next, on Slide 8, we provided our first quarter financial results. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Let's talk about the state of our business and the context in which we are viewing the remainder of 2016. To best understand where Endo is now, it's important to also understand where we've been and what we've built. When I joined the company in 2013, we charted a new strategic course and outlined some very clear goals, as seen here in the left column. Over the next 3 years, we set out to achieve these goals and position Endo for growth. That strategy is still core to Endo and to how we run our business. However, what has become clear is that the 2016 specialty pharmaceutical landscape and market forces require an evolution of that strategy. 
So let's talk about our path forward. Our goal has not changed. We continue to aspire to build a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company. What has changed rapidly is the landscape and market environment within which we are operating, particularly in generics. What does this mean going forward? It means we're reshaping the path forward for Endo. We are rebasing expectations for the business and are evolving our current strategy to meet challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Ultimately, we are positioning the company for long-term organic and diversified growth, margin improvement and delevering. 
So let me now turn the call over to Paul to discuss key factors and drivers related to generics. Paul?"

Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying and actual sales. The",1678,"Thank you, Rajiv, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's start with a snapshot of our Q1 2016 generics revenue on Slide 13. Here we present a bridge between our pro forma generic sales for Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 underlying and actual sales. The variances between the sales totals resulted from a greater-than-anticipated erosion in base business of approximately 30%, driven particularly by the legacy Qualitest portfolio. While we expected base erosion to be higher in the first quarter than the full year, the actual erosion was much deeper across our pain portfolio and other commoditized products than originally anticipated. By contrast, the legacy Par portfolio is performing on track with internal expectations. Our sterile injectables product portfolio continued its strong performance with 86% growth over Q1 2015. Our new launches and alternative dosage product portfolio performance was stable and largely unchanged year-over-year. 
So let's discuss the factors that impacted these Q1 results and that we believe will shape our full year generics performance. Moving to Slide 14. There are rapidly changing market conditions that have affected both the broader generic sector and Par. First, we've seen a steep and rapid price erosion caused by payer consolidation that has been more even [ph] profound than anticipated. Its effect has exceeded what might have been expected from an ordinary downturn in the industry's traditional pricing cycle. The impact has been particularly acute in the more commodity-like product categories, such as our pain and controlled substances portfolio and our immediate-release solid oral dosage forms. 
Second, coupled with this consolidation and new payer environment, competitors are taking aggressive pricing actions to gain market share. Examples include both the 300- and 325-milligram strength of hydrocodone APAP, butalbital, morphine sulfate and oxycodone. 
Third, there's been a rapid erosion of the pain segment, driven by 3 things: one, continued market contraction; two, increased competitive capacity and pressure; and three, while still too early to judge the full impact, we believe the recently issued CDC guidelines will continue to put pressure on an already soft pain market. As you may know, approximately 40% of the legacy Qualitest portfolio was comprised of pain products, so this sector's specific weakness has had a disproportionate effect on our generics business. Fourth, there's been a recent and marked acceleration of FDA approval for generic products. While we'll ultimately expect this to also benefit the Par portfolio and our own pending submissions over time, the approvals and launches seen in late Q1 and in April of this year have resulted in greater competitive pressure for our products. Fifth and finally, delays in expected FDA actions related to our 505(b)(2) products means that we have yet to see the anticipated removal of unapproved competitive products from the market. Correspondingly, we have yet to achieve the market exclusivity that we expected for these products. It's important to note that we still expect these FDA actions, but now on a delayed time line. The removal of relevant unapproved products may not occur before first half of 2017 versus our original expectation of early 2016. 
Now that we've talked about what's happened in the generics market, let's also take a few minutes to review when some of these events surfaced, thereby impacting our generic business. In 2016, it's important to note that the U.S. generic landscape has continued to shift, with significant events and updates as recently as late March and April. In fact, it was not until late March that we confirmed the delays on the regulatory actions related to our 505(b)(2) products that I just mentioned. Then in April alone, we see at least 5 competitive product approvals and additional market entrants. Finally, we've also just completed our consortium bid cycle with a more negative output and an increased pricing pressure than we anticipated. 
Moving to Slide 16. I do want to take a few moments to discuss our ongoing integration of the Qualitest and Par businesses. Last fall and Q1 of this year, we were conducting an integration of 2 complex generic businesses. What became very clear to those of us who have been in the generic industry for some time is that the legacy Par operating model is better positioned to address the challenges of today's evolving market. As a result, we set out to shift the legacy Qualitest portfolio strategy from a high-volume approach to the high-value operating model long practiced by legacy Par. As part of the integration activities, we're also transitioning the legacy Qualitest systems and processes to the Par business platform. The legacy Par systems offer more real-time and product level data, allowing for faster analysis and reaction within a challenging and changing market. While many of these improvements were already planned at Qualitest, the integration of our business will accelerate the benefits. 
Next on Slide 17. Let's talk about what we're doing to address these challenges and best position our generic business moving forward, our action plan. First, we are continuing to maximize our key growth drivers, such as our sterile injectables portfolio, led by Vasostrict, and approximately 30 new products that we expect to launch this year. Next, our platform for long-term organic growth is our R&D pipeline. We are continuing to advance these more than 250 projects post-reprioritization and anticipate filing 25 to 30 new submissions in 2016 alone. We are also accelerating the implementation of an optimization and restructuring of our product portfolio and manufacturing facility network. I'll talk more about this restructuring shortly. Additionally, we are accelerating the move of legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform. This is already substantially complete, as our commercial insight and forecasting capabilities have been fully transitioned. Finally, critical to our action plan is our ability to execute. This is not the first turbulent market environment that the Par team has successfully navigated. Our team is seasoned, capable and proven. 
Moving to Slide 18. Now permit me to provide some additional detail on the restructuring I mentioned earlier. Most importantly, this restructuring is an acceleration of our ongoing integration and broader optimization efforts designed to prioritize and grow high-value durable assets. It is entirely consistent with all our integration activities to date. The restructuring will affect our manufacturing sites in Charlotte and in Huntsville and will result in more than 60 product discontinuations. In addition, we are pruning less value-driven R&D projects so that we can prioritize our investments on differentiated and high-value projects. We expect that the restructuring will be completed by the third quarter of 2017 and will result in a total of approximately $60 million in annualized net run rate savings by Q4 of 2017. We expect to see about $10 million of that gross margin improvement this year. As a result, shortly, we will begin the process of informing employees about these changes. As part of that effort, approximately 740 employees will be impacted under a phased transition. For Endo, the Par management team and for me personally, this is both an extremely [ph] and disappointing to our company. We value our people, and for those who will be affected, we thank you all for what you've contributed to Endo. We'll be providing resources to help manage through this difficult transition. 
And while change is never easy, it is necessary to better position our generics division to successfully compete in the U.S. generics market. So on Slide 19. Let's talk about our full year revenue outlook for the generic segment. We have previously expected a mid-teens underlying growth rate for the business. Given the erosion now forecasted across the sector, and particularly for our base business, and the delay in regulatory action related to our 505(b)(2) products, offset by the strong growth projected for our sterile injectables and new launches and alternative dosage portfolios, we now expect underlying growth for our generics business to be in the low single digit percentage range. We do expect that erosion on our base business to moderate back to rates typical for the generic industry beyond 2016. The erosion in 2016 is expected to be more acute than historical trends due to our relative pricing and share levels in the pain markets prior to the observed and expected erosion. 
Moving to Slide 20. You'll see a look at our Q1 2016 reported generic net sales annualized versus our full year 2016 guidance midpoint. You can see the projected decline due to non-base business competitive entries and base erosion, which we expect to be approximately 5 years (sic) [ 5% ] per quarter through the end of the year. Our new product launches are a significant driver of growth, as illustrated by the green block, and bring you to our projected generic net sales midpoint for the year. 
Now let's look at our 2016 launches on Slide 21. We are on track to launch nearly 30 new products this year. 4 of these are first-to-file products including our generic Seroquel and generic Zetia products that will launch in the fourth quarter of 2016. Another 2 launch products are alternate dosages and another 9 are sterile injectables. Importantly, and as an illustration of our value-focused strategy and platform, nearly 1/3 of our projected launches are products that will be exclusive or face only one generic competitor. Finally, let's close this generics discussion with a quick review of our robust R&D pipeline on Slide 22. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have more than 250 projects in our reprioritized R&D pipeline. We anticipate launching more than 100 of them between 2016 and 2019, representing a total current market value of nearly $30 billion. Our pipeline is robust, diversified and populated by higher barrier-to-entry and higher-margin generic products. We believe that positions us strongly for future growth. I am confident in our platform and I believe that our pipeline is truly differentiated. I know that our team has the experience and the ability to address these challenges and to deliver future generics growth and margin expansion. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Rajiv for a discussion on our branded business. Rajiv?"

Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our U.S. Branded business. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Lortie, President U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, who will be leaving us to pursue other opportunities. Brian has been a critical part of the efforts to reposition our company over the last 3 years. We will miss him at Endo and wish him well in his future endeavors. 
Moving to Slide 24. Let's talk about factors affecting our U.S. Branded business. First, there has been a recent generic entrant for our Voltaren Gel product. This generic came into the market earlier than we expected, and it has affected our 2016 outlook for V Gel. Second, we have seen increasing pressure on our branded pain segment. This includes additional competitive entries as well as a continually increasing number of public policy and regulatory actions, such as the recent CDC guidelines around opioid prescribing and use. Additionally, there are reimbursement restrictions now in place for LIDODERM, further limiting the use of that branded product. Against this backdrop, we do continue to see significant growth potential in our differentiated product, BELBUCA. However, it has progressed at a slower pace than we initially expected due to pain market pressures. That said, we continue to believe in the future of this product as a Schedule III alternative in the opioid category. 
On Slide 25, you will see the opportunity for BELBUCA, the first and only buprenorphine Buccal Film for chronic pain management, which we launched in late February of this year. There are about 90 million total prescriptions written for the treatment of chronic pain below 160 milligrams of morphine sulfate equivalents or MSEs. BELBUCA is well positioned to source patients both from short-acting opioids as well as other long-acting opioids. Given the size of both these segments, even with a relatively small share of the available prescription base, BELBUCA could become a very meaningful product in this category. 
It is also important to note that even in these early days, BELBUCA is not only capturing switches from LAOs but also from SAOs and new therapy starts. Further, we have seen an increasing number of repeat prescriptions week-over-week. Its differentiated profile is resonating well with physicians and patients across the spectrum, and our early feedback on access, ease of use, efficacy and side effect profile have all been positive. 
Along these lines, let's look at Slide 26, to talk more about early progress on the BELBUCA launch. There are 3 areas that we have focused on in terms of early launch, traction and feedback. While I won't talk through each bullet here, we did want to provide a comprehensive look at where we are making progress and where we see opportunities to further accelerate BELBUCA launch traction. 
Next, on Slide 27, let's talk about XIAFLEX. XIAFLEX continues its double-digit demand growth profile, and we are making good progress in growing that business. We see a significant opportunity to expand both our share of the current treatment market as well as the size of the overall markets for both Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Across both of the DC and PD indications, we have new initiatives focused on driving growth. We are working to broaden our active injector base and have improved targeting to reach the most appropriate physicians. Our DTC and print ad campaign efforts are also showing signs of real traction. For example, visitors to the ""Ask About the Curve"" website spend about 10x longer on the site than an average website visit, and about 1 in 10 visitors click through to find the Peyronie's disease specialist in their area. 
We have also worked to improve convenience for physicians through our reimbursement support initiatives and our product savings program. Overall, these efforts position XIAFLEX for strong continued growth. We expect mid- to high teens percentage growth in 2016.
Moving to Slide 28. Let's talk about the other driver for XIAFLEX growth over the long term, our robust R&D pipeline. We see significant opportunity and substantial value for XIAFLEX across both therapeutic and aesthetic indications and have talked about how the product could be a $1 billion franchise for Endo by the mid-2020s. That opportunity is driven by the more than 12 potential indications currently in the R&D pipeline and the multiple additional programs in even earlier stages of development. As part of our evolved corporate strategy and initiatives to return to organic growth, we are accelerating our R&D programs for XIAFLEX and plan to move 5 programs into the clinic even earlier than previously expected in 2016. It is a time of significant opportunity for these growth drivers in our branded business. We have taken steps to best seize those opportunities and accelerate their growth while also managing the legacy products within our portfolio. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss our full year 2016 financial guidance. Suky?"
28071,331734375,975066,"Endo International plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. In an effort to provide you with more clarity, we are providing additional details on how the factors and market conditions that Paul and Rajiv discussed will impact Endo through the rest of 2016. On Slide 3",1034,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. In an effort to provide you with more clarity, we are providing additional details on how the factors and market conditions that Paul and Rajiv discussed will impact Endo through the rest of 2016. On Slide 30, we have provided an outline of the key components of change to our rebased revenue guidance that lead to an 11% reduction. As you can see, the largest driver of the change is the greater-than-expected erosion in our generics base business. As a reminder, we define base generics as extended release, immediate release and pain and controlled-substance products. As with the branded business, our rest of the year projections are based on business and commercial assessment and recent trend analysis at a product-by-product level that also takes into account the outcomes of recent bid cycles and competitive actions. 
Approximately 55% of the decline is related to price erosion and 45% relates to volume declines. This is an important variable, as price declines fall to margin at 100%. I should also note, we expect to realize the value of delayed 505(b)(2) actions later in 2017. 
Next, on Slide 31, let's look at the drivers for the changes in our projected gross margin for 2016. Our previous guidance was 63% to 65% for the full year. Given the impacts of key events and market factors, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 60%. Using the midpoint of the previous and revised guidance range, we expect gross margins to decline about 17% versus prior expectations. We are projecting a disproportionately higher erosion on gross margin versus revenue due to a number of factors that you will see detailed here in the blue call-out box. Importantly, we do expect to realize gross margin for our 505(b)(2) products in 2017, and we expect to offset the 2016 underabsorption through rationalization efforts into 2017.
Moving to Slide 32. We have provided a bridge from our previous EPS expectations for the full year to our revised guidance. The reduction in EPS reflect the revenue and gross margin drivers that I've just discussed. We've taken actions to help offset the declines we are projecting. In 2016, we are reducing OpEx across SG&A while remaining focused on prioritized investments against growth drivers and accelerating our branded R&D programs, and we project improvement in our tax rate. Lastly, we are taking actions to improve our gross margin profile through the plant rationalization that Paul covered earlier. 
On Slide 33, you will see our 2016 financial outlook by business segment, including expected, reported and underlying growth rates and gross margins across the portfolio. The branded business growth rate reflects the loss of exclusivity of V Gel. The generics outlook reflects the declines in the base business and the delayed regulatory actions that were discussed earlier. And international is broadly in line with previous expectations. 
Next, on Slide 34, we have outlined our full revised 2016 financial guidance. From a cadence perspective, we continue to see revenues and EPS weighted to the second half of the year, driven by the launches from the Par portfolio and continued growth from XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We now expect approximately 46% of revenues and 39% of full year EPS in the first half of 2016. This implies a sequential step-down in Q2 due to a number of drivers, including the full quarter impact of recently launched generic competitors that we talked about earlier on the call. In addition, we expect a ramp-up in spending in the second quarter, primarily related to our acceleration of R&D programs and commercial efforts in U.S. Branded. We have talked through the moving parts around revenues and gross margin. We expect interest expense to continue to be about $455 million. Our tax rate will be lower due to continued progress around planning strategies and due to a lower mix of U.S.-sourced income while maintaining static debt benefits and acquired attributes. Depending on the nature and timing of potential discrete items, the cadence of tax rate through the year can be lumpy. Consistent with prior commentary, we do expect a step-up in our tax rate in outer years. We now project that rate to be in the high single digits. 
Next on Slide 35. While our first quarter cash flow from operations was negative, it was impacted by a number of items that we consider to be noncore. After considering these items, underlying cash flow from operations continues to be well correlated to adjusted net income. I will also note that our working capital metrics are in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarter, we have provided more details around working capital in the appendix of this presentation. 
Moving to Slide 36. It is important to note that we continue to project robust cash from operations prior to legal-related cash calls. I will note that in early Q2, we received the full tax refund that we pointed to earlier in the year. Ultimately, we expect to use remaining cash to pay down approximately $250 million to $300 million in debt in 2016. 
Finally, on Slide 37, let me provide you with a snapshot of our liquidity profile. This is important because our cash position and liquidity ratios remain strong and well within our covenants as defined under our debt agreements. We do not foresee any challenge in remaining well within those limits in 2016 and beyond. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to remain in the high 4x in 2016, with some fluctuations based on quarterly cadence. We continue to remain committed to delevering into 3 to 4x range over time. 
In summary, as we rebased our outlook for our business, which is driven by the factors that Rajiv and Paul spoke to earlier, we remain committed to driving financial discipline, including taking actions to improve gross margins, investing in growth drivers, becoming more efficient around G&A, continuing to improve our underlying tax rate, optimizing our cost of capital, driving improvements in working capital and improving after-tax cash flows from operations to service our liabilities and for investments in future growth. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Rajiv."

Now that we have discussed the market factors, what we are doing to address them and the anticipated impact on our 2016 financial expectations, let's talk about how Endo is positioned for 2016 and beyond. 
On Slide 39, you will see the corporate strategy as we laid it out in 2013 and the actions we took to rebuild the business over the past 3 years. We have successfully changed the structure, the businesses and the growth profile of Endo. Now, given the evolving market conditions, it is time for us to continue to evolve our corporate strategy and transform the company for long-term durable growth. 
On Slide 40, let me talk about how we feel Endo is positioned for growth. Our aspiration to build a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company that improves lives and creates value has not changed. We are mindful, though, that we need to set appropriate medium-term goals reflecting current market conditions. This has meant rebasing of our financial guidance for 2016 and a reset of our previous expectations for 2017. However, our goals are clear: return to organic growth at levels above market averages; improve operating margins to be greater than 40%; and delever to between 3 to 4x. 3 core areas of focus will enable these goals: growth in our branded business and the XIAFLEX pipeline; growth in our generics business and pipeline; and the ongoing optimization of our existing business.
Moving to Slide 41. There are many key growth drivers that strongly position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We know we have significant in-market growth opportunities in both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to structure our team and our business to achieve that growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of legacy products. We are also accelerating our derisked innovative R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. 
As we execute this year, we will be achieving key milestones across our U.S. Branded business and we will keep you updated regarding our progress. On Slide 42, let's talk about the durable portfolio and pipeline we have in our U.S. generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated higher barrier-to-entry products, like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs post-restructuring. We have a diversified and, importantly, reset base business and a robust highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they execute on these opportunities. 
Let's summarize on Slide 43. We have rebased our business and believe this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo. We have a clear plan to focus on strategic priorities: a return to organic growth, margin improvement and delevering. Our key growth -- our key future growth drivers continue to provide promise to deliver against these strategic priorities. And perhaps, most importantly, Endo is a resilient organization, and we are all committed to our future. Together, we will execute on our evolved corporate strategy and achieve our goal to deliver products that improve patients' lives while creating value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me now turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period."

When we look at those, they bounce in terms of specifically in the legacy Qualitest portfolio. We had challenges both in pain and, really, the solid oral dosage immediate-release portfolio. And what we were seeing was it was a combination of new competitors coming into the market that were established as well as just first-time players as well. So it was a combination of some smaller generic competitors entering the market that ultimately pushed the price down. And a lot of these occurrence were coming in the late March and April time frame. So in essence, it was several factors in terms of competition as well as loss of business. And clearly, on the FDA side, in terms of new competitors coming in and new approvals rather, I think with the GDUFA really starting to hit, we are going to see more players in some of these commodity-based products. But at the same time, we have 150 products at the FDA. So you should also assume that we will also get the positive impact of a quicker approval.

We do see ourselves pushing that target from 3 to 4x from 2016 into 2017 or beyond. There are a number of moving parts that will help with that. Without giving specific guidance, some of the things I've pointed to earlier is, late in this year, we will build about $200 million of working capital. As far as the Seroquel and Zetia launch, that will be recovered in the first half of 2017 as we actually collect the cash on that revenue booked in 2016. As we move into next year, we expect mesh gross payments to moderate down slightly. This year, we would see those mesh payments as being somewhere between $800 million to $900 million. Next year, we would predict that, that would be somewhere around $600 million. So we should see a step-down in gross mesh payments into next year. And then the other big drivers are on capital expenditures. We do see a step-up this year as part of the integration of Par and Qualitest, primarily around the implementation of ERP systems. That should moderate down in 2017. And then we could see a slight step-up in the contingent consideration line that I've outlined here for '16, primarily due to the 505(b)(2) products that Paul has spoken to as well as V Gel. So there's a couple of moving parts that can kind of help you shape where '17 cash might be. But again, we do expect, over time, to delever back into that 3 to 4x range."

The second one was just talking about the generic outlook in '17. Just from our perspective, what do you think it's going to take to stabilize the legacy Qualitest business? And just how are you thinking about growth in the portfolio overall, once we get through this difficult 2016 and start to think about the longer-term portfolio?"

Now in terms of the things that have gone wrong this year, right, so you're right. We've had several things that have not gone our way, and many of those things -- actually all of those things have played out over the course of the last 4 to 6 weeks, right, in the second half of March and in early April. But I'll point to the 3 things that have happened, right, so the 3 material things that have happened. First one is the earlier-than-expected launch of the Voltaren Gel generic. So we clearly didn't see it coming as early as it did. We had forecasted it towards the very, very back end of this year at worst, and best case into 2017. Now that being said, we knew that there was going to be a generic for Voltaren Gel at some point, right, so -- and in fact, the newly revised agreement with GSK and Novartis give us the right to an authorized generic, so we will have a tail of that product going through 2017 and beyond. So yes, that was bad news. It was earlier than expected, but not something that fundamentally impacts our longer-term growth trajectory. The second event that Paul referred to was this delay in the 505(b)(2) programs. And again, our expectation, while it is bad news for 2016, is that it does, in fact, manifest itself from 2017 and will in fact benefit '17 as well as '18, depending on when the FDA actually acts. So then it comes down to the Qualitest base business, right, and I'm going to let Paul pick it up. But basically what we've seen is a real reset in Q1, and Paul talked about the impact of the consortiums, the confluence of competitors that came in for some of our bigger products, like the 325-milligram Hydro-APAP product, which is Qualitest's largest product that happened post -- mid-March. All of those things have happened in a way that has reset that business. And the way we have thought about the guidance is that we've clearly taken a view of saying, how do we predict this erosion continuing through this year, right? So we do see continued erosion through this year. But by the same token, and Paul will elaborate on this, our view is that as we go into 2017, the continued erosion in this base business will moderate to what you would typically see in a commoditized generic business, and the future really is about the pipeline and segments like the sterile injectable segment, right? So with that, let me just turn it over to Paul. Maybe you can talk a bit about our confidence about the remainder of the year and the moving parts going into '17."

So Chris, your question is really on stabilization and really why do we think it's going to get better. I think the first thing that we want to talk about is, is that, historically, we've had successes with the Qualitest portfolio, but we've got a call it what it is. It is a mature portfolio that is susceptible to competition. With that, we are transferring the strategy from that high-volume throughput that, historically, had successes on economies of scale, to the more Par legacy success model of high-value products, where we're having more technically-challenging products, things that are more difficult to make. Now the first thing we have to do, we talked about the restructuring, right? So we need to take the portfolio. We've got to rightsize it. We've got to be real smart about product selection and what we're going to continue to sell in the market. We're making some very, very difficult decisions impacting some very talented people in our Charlotte and in our Huntsville facility. That's been very difficult for all of us. So that's the starting point: to focus on the restructuring plan. And it gets back down to our core values of operational execution, something that we are really driving home at Par. Rajiv talked about it already. The pipeline is where we're going to be able to reset ourselves. Ultimately, 75% of our value coming is from 2 products, fourth quarter. We've talked quite a bit about quetiapine and Zetia. I'm not going to spend a lot of time there. But we have to execute on the entire portfolio, and at the same time, we've got to continue to repopulate the products as we launch them. So that, coupled with -- again, got to get the 505(b)(2)s, and we have other 505(b)(2)s across the portfolio. It's not just the 2 that we're referring to, but we need to execute. We have a path forward. We have a good strategy. I think these are areas that are going to help us ultimately stabilize our base, and at the same time, we can't lose focus on our service levels and our quality and continue with diversification of our portfolio."

And I would say, our guidance range for the full year is a realistic range, right? So no business is without its risks, and I think you know that. But we have taken a substantial downward revision in the base business in generics. We have -- and I commented on how we are treating Voltaren Gel. We've also taken the opportunity to address some other parts of our branded business because of the continued pressure in the pain market, that we rebase some of those products as well. So we've really taken the opportunity to take a hard look at the forecast in this rebasing, right? So we don't take this lightly. I mean, it's not something that we want to do more than once, right? So that's the course that we have taken. We are confident in this guidance range, and we have a team that is going to work extremely hard at executing against this range. But as always, as I already point [ph], that there is always risk. And then -- yes, one second. So Louise, I was also just going to answer the second question you asked. So for us and our Board of Directors, our goal is longer-term shareholder value creation, right? So certainly, that is -- the last -- the -- what's happened with the business over the course of the last few weeks and months is a disappointment and a setback. But I would point out that our future growth drivers remain unscathed in terms of these particular events that we talked about, right? So we point to XIAFLEX, the XIAFLEX pipeline. We talked to BELBUCA, which, even though, there is, potentially, a delay in terms of the launch trajectory of that product, we continue to believe in the future of that product. And the Par pipeline, which is the primary driver of that acquisition, is robust as ever, right? It continues to grow. The sterile injectables business is robust and growing, and I have every confidence in Paul and the team in terms of getting the generics business back on track. So from that standpoint, we believe that in the hands of our management team, with the appropriate rebasing that we've done in 2016, that there is a path to returning to organic growth, improving our margins and delevering, and therefore, to creating shareholder value going forward.

But at a high level as you talk about the new strategy and even reassessed the environment, I think you highlighted where are the growth drivers you currently have. But as you look longer term at trying to incubate additional drivers, where are the opportunities in this environment and the types of products that are going to have the right risk/reward to pursue? And then as you go about managing that, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about balancing cash generation in the near term, and particularly with regard to leverage ratios, versus investments you may want to make in longer-term opportunities? And just specifically on that, as you talk about rationalizing some of the legacy products, were these loss-making? Or is some cash flow being given up?

Let me just take your 3 questions, and I will let Paul talk about the product rationalization question at the end. So from a long-term standpoint, I think what we continue to be very optimistic about is following the XIAFLEX pipeline",507,"So thank you, Andrew. Let me just take your 3 questions, and I will let Paul talk about the product rationalization question at the end. So from a long-term standpoint, I think what we continue to be very optimistic about is following the XIAFLEX pipeline, right? So we've pursued the cellulite indication. Our Phase IIb trial is in the clinic and currently recruiting patients. We feel positive about that. And you've also seen that we have increased confidence in being able to move forward, at least, 4 other indications into the clinic, right? And they fall generally into the areas of aesthetics as well as other therapeutic indications around the non-collagenists. So the one core priority for us is continued and increased investment in that R&D pipeline. In the -- the pain market, clearly, in terms of public policy and regulatory pressures, is increasing their market. As we said before, BELBUCA has a real profile that could really benefit in terms of some of the current concerns around Schedule II opioids, so we do think there's a future there. But as we look further out into the future, building on our portfolio across our branded business, we could see ourselves in multiple areas that have similar characteristics to other specialty areas, where with a smaller focused sales and marketing footprint that we can be successful. And following some of the therapeutic areas where XIAFLEX is going to get us to, it's going to be the best way for us to pursue that. Now leading to your next question, in terms of cash and our priorities for using the cash, as Suky explained when we talked about delevering, we do expect to continue to prioritize delevering. And delevering back to the 3 to 4x is an important goal for us. Now that is delayed from 2016 into 2017 but continues to be an important goal for us. At the same time, investing in our R&D pipeline, both in XIAFLEX as well as Par, are going to be very important priorities for us, which we will balance as we go, right? So those are going to be the most important uses of cash. And beyond that, and obviously, once we get into a position where we have excess cash and have the opportunity to look at, perhaps, bolt-on acquisitions, either for the generics business or the branded business, we will certainly look at those as they come up. Our preference would be to do so in the branded space, but that is a ways out. We want to make sure that we execute against our growth plan and delever as our primary priorities, and we always keep the option of returning cash holder -- cash to shareholders as an alternative as well. Now let me just turn this over to Paul because I want him to talk to you about some of the new areas that we might expand the pipeline into as well as the question that you had on product rationalization and the profitability impact of that."

So it's, obviously, a very important question, and I want to start by saying, this -- the decision in terms of the -- culling the portfolio, as I said, very, very difficult for us. But as you look at legacy Par and as part of the normal course, it really is an evolution where you need to consistently look at your portfolio. You have to make some tough decisions. You have to take your unprofitable products or products that are -- you're feeling pain and pressure on. That being said, we're the fourth-largest generic company. We are incredibly relevant. We will continue to be relevant in the industry, and I want to make that statement. And when you -- if you want to be able to compete with the 4 large consortiums, add Walmart in, those 5 companies representing in excess of 90% share, you really need a well-balanced portfolio. And what I mean by that is you need your fair share of Paragraph IVs. You need hard-to-make, technically challenging, solid oral dosage products. You need injectable products, and you do need commodities that are profitable. So that's going to be very important to us in terms of the Qualitest portfolio on a go-forward basis. Now on discontinuation of products, hard decisions. But by culling the portfolio in areas that is going to help us, parts that are ultimately being sold at losses, and we make the tough decisions, it's going to help us on the cash side. It's -- we're going to have a reduction in our operating costs. We'll have a reduction in working capital, and we'll also not need to invest as much in certain facilities from a CapEx standpoint. So from that standpoint, generally speaking, high level, those would be areas that we would have savings in."

And as we move into 2017, we'll have a better view into that, but I do think the growth drivers are at a gross margin level that are higher than our overall corporate average.

And the last week for which we have data, I think, is the week of April 21, and we had roughly 650 prescriptions. And we continue to see momentum, right? And it's difficult to predict exactly when the inflection point is going to be, but what I can say is that the anecdotal feedback and the qualitative feedback from physicians has been very positive. And I, myself, have spent time in the field. And the fact that this is a Schedule III product, despite all the new pressure that is on physicians with the new CDC guidelines and everything else, the message resonates, right? But that being said, from the very beginning, we pointed to something that would likely lead to requiring more time to educate physicians, and that is the tapering and titration required with this product, right? So to the extent that you are trying to move a patient from other therapy onto BELBUCA, you have to taper that patient down per our label and then titrate the patient back up. And for most physicians, what they are trying to do is to figure out their own gut feel for how this works. Clearly, from a promotional standpoint, we have to stand behind what's on the label, but every physician will figure out what he or she is comfortable with. I would also say another encouraging sign is that the repeat prescription from those who prescribed is progressing very well, so we have as many repeat prescriptions now as we have new Rxs. So these are all good indicators. I'm going to hesitate to give you an exact time frame of when there's going to be an inflection point, but I would point to the second half of this year in terms of when we would expect to see a continued improvement in it. And I am afraid I've forgotten the second part of your question. Oh, yes, it was on the managed care. So it is progressing very well. As we have said before, we have roughly about 2/3 of commercial lives covered, at least with default coverage. We made very good progress in terms of converting the default coverage into actual coverage. Many of the plans require -- have confidentiality agreements that prevent us from talking about these things in a public way. But one that we can point to, where we have permission to talk about, is Express Scripts. That has been a very good win for us. We are continuing our discussions with other plans. And so far, there has -- it's going exactly as we had expected. Now the one piece that we would expect to not get to until 2017 is the Medicare Part D coverage, but that is on par with the -- all of the situations where a product launches midyear. We've also implemented a copay program that basically puts a product on par with competitive products. So in -- from all aspects, from an access standpoint, we are making good progress."

So from a strategic standpoint, we remain open to thinking about creative ways of creating shareholder value. But as I pointed to earlier in my comments, our primary focus right now is operational execution. We have a full plate in Par in terms of restructuring that needs to be done, focus on the pipeline, as well as in the branded business, growing XIAFLEX and growing the BELBUCA and investing in the pipeline.

In 2013, we had 2 primary and declining assets at that time and a very fragmented base of business across health care solutions, divided in pharmaceuticals. You fast-forward to today, we've rebuilt our branded portfolio and pipeline, with the acquisition of Auxilium, in particular XIAFLEX. We've divested noncore businesses. We've achieved scale and differentiation in our generics portfolio with the addition of Par. In fact, that is what the future is going to be about, particularly as we think [ph] to see the rebasing of our legacy Qualitest business. 
We're establishing international structure and footprint for growth and expansion. We narrowed the mesh tail, and we have built a business generating significant EBITDA even after this rebasing, and free cash flow that we expect to grow going forward. 
So no one likes to rebase guidance more than I, but we have now reset our business so that we can move forward and effectively drive growth and value, and we thank you for your continued support.

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here is a brief agenda for today's call. 
Moving to Slide 3. The second quarter was a busy and productive one for us at Endo. I am pleased that we delivered solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter, with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. We also made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. We have made an important addition to the management team, made good progress on key growth drivers and progressed our ongoing legal reorganization, which provides us with operational flexibility and benefits. Suky will talk about this reorganization in more detail later in the call.
Against the backdrop of this progress, we are taking steps to increase investments in our future organic growth drivers, branded and generics R&D as well as BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotional efforts. Importantly, we are pleased to affirm our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance despite these additional investments. 
On Slide 4, you will see a snapshot of our solid segment results for the second quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me discuss in further detail how we remain focused on operational execution and achieving our key milestones. We announced the appointment of Joe Ciaffoni as our new President of the U.S. Branded business. We are delighted that Joe has joined Endo, bringing his proven expertise in launching and growing branded products and look forward to his contributions when he assumes his new post later this month. 
We continue to drive growth in our generic sterile injectables products, and our generics base business is performing right in line with expectations we communicated to you in May of this year. We secured a patent for our largest product, Vasostrict, and continued to launch differentiated generics products and filed new ANDAs with the FDA. 
In our international business, we filed our BELBUCA submission and secured rights to XIAFLEX in Canada. And we have also advanced our branded R&D pipeline and have recently opted into another new potential indication for XIAFLEX Human Lipoma.
So on Slide 6, let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations, which underlie our segment revenue and margin guidance provided in May. We drove continued XIAFLEX demand while abroad, particularly in Peyronie's disease. We are advancing our BELBUCA launch efforts, increasing the total prescriptions to date and growing the number of repeat prescriptions.
In the quarter, we also saw better-than-expected results, driven by contracting for the branded Voltaren Gel and performance across some of our other products such as LIDODERM, NASCOBAL and SUPPRELIN L.A. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let's take a closer look at XIAFLEX's performance. We are making good progress with this key growth asset, and that is transferring into continued growth. In Peyronie's disease, a market that we think has considerable growth and expansion potential, we delivered nearly 20% demand growth in the second quarter versus the same period last year. We continue to expand our physician injector base, and our disease awareness campaign, Ask About the Curve, has shown early signs of successfully engaging PD patients. In Dupuytren's contracture, a more mature market and one where XIAFLEX launched more than 5 years ago, we still drove 5% demand growth in the quarter over the second quarter last year. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by greater-than-expected destocking. For the full year 2016, we now expect low double-digit pro forma revenue growth for XIAFLEX. 
On Slide 8, let's move next to International Pharmaceuticals. We continue to drive performance in line with expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, [indiscernible] and SOMAR. At Paladin, we filed our BELBUCA submission and acquired the Canadian rights to XIAFLEX last quarter. Both products have potential long-term growth drivers for the business. And the additions could provide longer-term growth as we manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. 
In our [indiscernible] and SOMAR businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume. And we continue to improve our operating margins. 
Now to talk about our U.S. Generics performance, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul?"
28071,375875901,1030245,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you all for joining us on the call. Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all while",534,"Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you all for joining us on the call. 
Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all while delivering performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow, led by Vasostrict. Importantly, we also secured a patent for that product that does not expire until 2035 and which we believe further strengthens our market position. 
And our new launches in alternative segment, we've launched 11 products since the beginning of the year and continue to file new ANDs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. As we expected, and in line with the trends consistent across the broader generic industry, our base business declined by approximately 5% sequentially from first quarter 2016, driven by consortium pricing pressures in competitive generic entrants. 
Finally, our adjusted gross margin for the generics business remained in line with expectations. I would like to note that second quarter revenues benefited modestly from some favorable timing between Q2 and Q3, driven by customers advancing some of their orders ahead of the Fourth of July holiday. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I'd like to provide you with an update on the action plan that we outlined last quarter to drive long-term growth across our generics portfolio. While I won't go into the detail on each of these items, I do think it's important to note that we are in progress, on track or have already completed all the core components of our action plan. For example, we continue to make progress on key growth drivers like our 505(b)(2) in sterile injectables programs as well as launching a steady stream of new, differentiated products this year. We're also reprioritizing and accelerating our R&D pipeline. We've already rationalized numerous lower-value projects as part of our restructuring and are on track to find approximately 25 to 30 new ANDA submissions in 2016. We made progress on our accelerated restructuring plan for the generics manufacturing network and continue to project approximately $60 million in annual net run rate savings to be fully realized by fourth quarter 2017. We've largely completed the transition of the legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform, including commercial insight, forecasting, wholesaler data management and other capabilities. And finally, we are executing on our operational plan. 
We have delivered a second quarter that is in line with the expectations that underline our guidance for revenue and adjusted margins grievously communicated in May.
So let me talk briefly about our product launches to date and those anticipated for the remainder of the year. 
On Slide 11, you'll see a familiar chart. We have updated it to show all the price we have successfully launched so far in 2016. You can also see those projects that we expect to launch into the marketplace in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are on track for our November and December 2016 launches of generic Seroquel XR and generic Zetia. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our projected outlook. Suky?"
28071,375875901,1030245,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP compliance",1076,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP compliance and disclosure interpretations, or CNDI guidance, in May. Endo has adopted these guidelines and, as a result, is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. This policy has no impact on Endo's historic or forward-looking GAAP tax or cash tax profile. Also, the initiation of a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter has limited the impact of this change on our adjusted effective tax rate for the year and moving forward. 
Moving to Slide 14. We provided more detail about the legal entity reorganization that I just mentioned. As part of the continued integration of our Qualitest and Par businesses, we initiated a legal entity reorganization that moves the generics business to a new U.S. holding company structure that is separate from the legacy branded business structure. The reorganization provides operating Flexibility and benefits while also reducing the potential impact related to future limits on the use of tax attributes by utilizing most of our attributes to offset an intercompany gain. As a result of this reorganization, the tax bases of U.S. Generics business assets have been stepped up to their fair value, which will provide ongoing cash tax benefit and flexibility in moving assets with limited tax leakage.
The utilization of acquired attributes that I mentioned earlier would have had an unfavorable impact of approximately $160 million on our full year adjusted tax expense under Endo's non-GAAP policy prior to the adoption of the SEC's C&DI. The elimination of this acquired attribute benefit was offset by an improved mix of jurisdictional adjusted pretax income resulting primarily from the reorganization. 
This reorg also gave rise to a discrete net GAAP tax benefit of approximately $450 million in the second quarter from outside bases differences. This benefit has been excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with our policy. 
As I talked about earlier, as a result of the SEC's C&DI, Endo is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. However, since we utilized almost all of our tax attributes through the legal entity reorganization,  the implementation of the updated C&DI guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our 2016 and forward-looking adjusted tax rate. Endo continues to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 0 to 2%, as guided, in our first quarter 2016 earnings announcement. We expect to have a GAAP tax benefit and a negative cash tax rate for 2016.
Importantly, for our outlook for 2017 and future years, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the high single digits to low double digits and our average cash tax rate to be below 5% over the next 5 years. 
Next, on Slide 15, you will see a snapshot of the second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Rajiv covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. 
On a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $1.75 in the quarter versus a loss of $0.49 in the second quarter of 2015. 2016 second quarter GAAP results were driven by an operating loss of $48 million, offset by the tax benefit that I discussed earlier. Tax benefit also offset the impact of a higher share count in 2016. 
Our GAAP operating loss was largely impacted by a decrease in gross margins due to higher mix of generics revenue in the second quarter compared to 2015 and due to incremental amortization expense associated with the stepped up value of intangible assets from Par. On an adjusted basis, overall Q2 results are slightly better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points Rajiv and Paul made, revenue was better than expected due to sterile injectables, stronger-than-expected performance from a number of branded products and a modest timing benefit related to quarter-end buying patterns. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues discussed earlier. 
On Slide 16, while the second quarter was ahead of our guided expectations, we are maintaining our guidance ranges, as some of the upside in the second quarter was driven by favorable timing. As Rajiv much, we are also going to invest at a higher level than originally planned in our key growth drivers in the second half of the year through reallocation of operating expenses and a modest step-up in spending. 
Regarding the cadence of revenues and adjusted earnings in the second half of the year, we continue to project the fourth quarter to be disproportionately larger than the rest of the year's quarters due to the launch of the generics Seroquel and Zetia. For third quarter 2016, we expect revenues in the range of $830 million to $870 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.82. This implies a sequential step-down in third quarter 2016. The anticipated decline is driven by the product order timing benefits in second quarter that we expect to reverse in third quarter, lower U.S. branded sales related to generic competition for Voltaren Gel, continued slowing in the testosterone market, continued decline in legacy pain products, and an increased investment in R&D as well as XIAFLEX and BELBUCA promotional efforts. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 17. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP cash flow from operations totaled approximately $555 million. We have also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our reported or GAAP cash flows for the year. 
On Slide 18, we are reiterating our view on cash available to pay down debt in 2016. We continue to project debt pay-down of approximately $250 million in 2016 and to exit the year at a mid- to high 4x net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $670 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $390 million in restricted cash and a net debt-to-leverage ratio of approximately 4.6x. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by our second quarter financial results and pleased to affirm our full year outlook while increasing investment in key growth drivers. 
Now to close out the call, let me turn it back over to Rajiv. Rajiv?"

Moving to Slide 20. In summary, there are a number of 3 [ph] growth drivers that position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We believe strongly in the significant in-market growth opportunities for both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to optimize our team and our business to achieve their growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of other products. We are also accelerating our R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. 
We continue to execute on these growth drivers in the second quarter and expect to achieve additional key milestones through the end of this year and beyond. 
On Slide 21, let's recap the key achievements in our U.S. Generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated, higher barrier to entry products like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs for restructuring. We have a diversified reset base business and a robust, highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they continue to execute on these opportunities. 
Let's briefly summarize our call today on Slide 22. In Q2, we delivered solid top and adjusted bottom line results beating our Q2 adjusted results guidance. We made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. And we are affirming our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance while increasing our investment in branded and generic R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotion. 
Endo is executing on our strategic priorities, and we continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for the company, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me now turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer. Keri?"

Louise, let me address the first 2 questions, and I will have Paul address the third one. So in XIAFLEX, as we have commented in the past, the growth profile does tend to be a little bit lumpy and have some seasonal fluctuations. So as you might recall, we had a very robust growth in the first quarter. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in Dupuytren's contracture in the second quarter. But as we look out over the remainder of the year, we do feel confident in the double-digit growth trajectory that we have talked about. Now in terms of the revenue profile, as you know, customer stocking is largely out of our control, though, typically, XIAFLEX stocking in the specialty pharmacy, in general, is around 14 days, about 2 weeks. But from time to time, we do see some unusual changes, which is what happened in the second quarter. Our stocking is around 1 week, so approximately half of what it typically is. Now we have seen this behavior in the past, and typically, over the course of the year, it tends to normalize. But by and large, it is out of our control. So what we look to is demand while growth. And that's where when we look at the 19% growth in Peyronie's, we do feel very good about the indication, given that from a longer-term perspective, for our on-market indications, the biggest opportunity is in Peyronie's. In terms of divestment of noncore assets, I just wanted to be clear that from a company perspective, we don't feel compelled to divest any assets. We are confident in our business and the natural delevering nature of the business, given the -- our substantial cash flows, particularly as we look beyond the [indiscernible] payments in '16 and '17. Now that being said, I think we've also been clear that as a company and as a board, we're always -- we are shareholder-friendly, and when there are opportunities that come our way that are value-creating, we will certainly evaluate them on a standard basis. Paul, maybe you can comment on the Qualitest business."

That also includes some of the Par portfolio. When you look at that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we communicated this at our last earnings call, that we were anticipating about 5% erosion quarter-over-quarter, and that's exactly where we landed. So it's in line with our expectations and how we communicated. So generally, our base business is falling in line, and we're not seeing the heavy erosion that we realized in Q1."

So in BELBUCA, the feedback continues to be similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, which is positive feedback from physicians, positive feedback into the patient experience. The 2 areas which are leading to slow uptake of the product beyond just the overall environment in opioid, one is the process of getting physician comfortable with the tapering and titrating requirements in terms of switching patients between different opioids and onto BELBUCA. And secondly, it's around the payer environment and how they see the [indiscernible] products. So on the latter, we made good progress at this point. We have contracted roughly around 85% of commercial lives, and about 70% of that without any restrictions beyond the label. We expect to continue to improve that over the course of the year. But of course, at this point in the launch of the product like this, we don't yet have government reimbursement. But what we see as being the real opportunity is the pharmacoeconomic and public health argument for why [indiscernible] product like BELBUCA is preferable to other opioids such as the scheduled 2 products in terms of where it is introduced in the treatment algorithm. And a lot of the investment that we're now making is around improving our fact base in terms of making those market access arguments. And clearly, we still continue to have a large investment from a field force standpoint, and that continues. And we also increasing our investment around physician education, particularly around the treatment and [indiscernible] of the product.

We continue to believe that there's a real long-term opportunity with XIAFLEX as an oral platform for the company, given the fact there's a biologic, given the multitude of potential indications that we have as well as potential in the on-market indications. That being said, we have been making predictions about '17 and beyond, but I would say that we are very optimistic when we look at the current results that we are seeing in Peyronie's disease, which we think is the great opportunity for the 2 -- of the 2 on-market indications. And there are 3 areas in which we have made promotion investments and we expect to step up for the remainder of the year as well as going to '17, and they will be following. One is an area which we already talked about, which is that we continue to need to make the lives of patients [indiscernible] prescribe the product easy. And that's mostly around reimbursement support, and we've substantially increased the level of internal resourcing around that as well as targeted third parties to support that. The second is a longer-term opportunity around disease awareness building. And we have begun to do piloting and early investments, particularly in Peyronie's, through our online campaign, Ask About the Curve. And it's, of course, too early to fully realize the benefit from it or fully conclude what the benefits will look like, but the early signs of web click-throughs and patient interest in going on to our site of physicians selected, for example, substantial uptick in that, right? Now clearly, for a product like this, the cycle from the time you get patient interest in the product or interest going to physician to the time that he would have her first injection could be 6 to 9 months, which is why we always point out to the back half of this year, '17 before we really begin to see the benefit from it. The third thing I would say is, this is probably more so true for Dupuytren's contracture than Peyronie's, is the need to make a compelling argument around the pharmacoeconomic benefits of an intervention like XIAFLEX versus surgery. And that's more of a opportunity for us in Dupuytren's contracture, where the hand surgeons who treat the conditions often see surgical option as the first option. And we, of course, had very good success with the product with these physicians, but getting to the next level is going to require making the human strong argument on why this is the best interest of patients."

Obviously, we got the patent listed in June. I think it was June 28. The way we kind of look at this product right now simply is from 2 different views. There was always a possibility that there could be a file that was issue with the FDA, pre-Orange Book file listing, and that's something where maybe we feel a little bit better about. And typically, what happened is if an application was in at the FDA for several months, prior to the Orange Book listing, what you would expect is for a generic competitor to find a Paragraph IV very quickly and then we would have been noticed. That didn't happen from that standpoint. We feel a little bit better. If an application went on file a month or 2, pre-June 28 or shortly thereafter, that's where we're not going to have that visibility. But if we were to get a Paragraph IV, say, today, it would take about 60 to 90 days for an application to be accepted for filing. So we would probably look to be in a 30-month stay, ticking somewhere late fourth quarter. That's the way I would start looking at it. So from that standpoint, we had originally said that we felt good through 2017. We probably will be in a position to stay that we feel a little bit good through 2018, but we'll have better visibility around fourth quarter. In terms of the generic pipeline, from a standpoint of where we feel real good about, I think we'd like to focus a little bit on the 505(b)(2) side. And that's an area of strength of the company, right? So while we haven't disclosed specifics, we do have a series of 505(b)(2)s that are starting to come through to fruition. And frankly, maybe we can talk a little bit more in terms of products that we feel a little bit better about. We had previously talked about 2 505(b)(2)s that we did not shed a light on. We feel little bit better about them now. They are 2 forms of potassium. One is a liquid and one is a powder form. We have started to receive positive feedback from the FDA in terms of removing unapproved sources. That's going to come to an end, whereby these unapproved sources will have the remainder of 2016 or so to have product into the market. These types of products will show benefit to Par and Endo in 2017. So that's an area that we'd like to focus in on. Thank you."

So for BELBUCA in the first couple of quarters, we've been clear that we think we are using a pull-through method to recognize revenue. So it has been minimal revenue recognition in the first half of the year, so single-digit millions. And the -- we've also been clear that given our launch ramp expectations that we expect the contributions in 2016, in total, to be relatively modest. So we would look to 2017 really as the first year of revenue contributions for BELBUCA, and I would be clear about expectations at the appropriate time. In terms of pricing, and I'll let Paul answer this specific question, I'll point out the following, which is from an oral perspective, the Endo business benefits from volumes, not price. And in particular, generics business has predominantly more price pressure than upward price potential. And if any prices -- any price increase that we might be able to take on the true generics part of it is all owned by the presentation that we've seen on the base business. Now products like Vasostrict are a little different and that they are sold basis of the NDA, although this is within Par. But even in those cases, we take a responsible approach to pricing increase. And just because we have flexibility does not mean that we will take a price increase. In the case of Vasostrict, the Par has been very thoughtful about how to price the product as NDA. [indiscernible] to the product, it is still in the low hundreds in terms of -- sorry, 125 or so, plus or minus, in terms of unit costs. And a substantial I might've investment also gone into our Rochester Michigan facility to support this product and CapEx in excess of $100 million. And from a forward-looking standpoint, our philosophy in price increases will not change, which is that we'll be responsible about how we think about it.

And we had to make certain and tough decisions based upon how we started looking at products on a go-forward basis. And we were also a little bit on the volume side versus a value side. We made a conscious decision to start to look towards more difficult-to-make products. Now that's something that we've executed very, very well on, and that's where we're looking at our total portfolio. Now immediate-release products are always going to be important to Par, right? And that's going to help build volume [indiscernible] for wholesalers. But we're looking for longevity and that's why you're going to see us move more towards the alternative dosage forms in the injectable forms and continue with the Paragraph IV side.

The consortiums have gotten bigger and stronger, and that goes right back to having the execute on the earlier statement that I made is the competitive going to survive and do well are the companies that going to have compliance across-the-board, something that we've done very, very well. We spend more some economic amount of capital to compliance, service levels and execution on the R&D side. And there was a question on control some stuff [indiscernible].

But from a contracting standpoint, we still hold some proportion of the market in our branded products, but clearly subject to generic pressures.

And Suky, on your question on your third quarter sequential reduction, the first thing I would say is generally, as a default, we tend to prefer not to give quarterly guidance because there are a lot of things that can affect a quarter, specifically around timing, that could be material to the quarter. But on a whole year basis, they are not meaningful. But having said that, given our recent in Q1 and given the launches that we've got in fourth quarter, we are providing quarterly guidance at least for this year. For the third quarter, the way to think about the step-down is, one, you talked about already, which is the stocking that we saw in the second quarter. Our assumption is that, that reverses in the third quarter. Also what underpin our assumption of the step-down is continued erosion in retail as that continues to face competition from a generic standpoint. We would expect LIDODERM to step down modestly. Our testosterone products continue to decline quarter-over-quarter, particularly because of the market. And then, again, we also expect to see some modest decline in our pain products. All of those declines are partially offset by growth in XIAFLEX and BELBUCA as well as Par launches. But net-net, our assumptions lead us to a decline on revenue into the third quarter. From an investment standpoint, that's all coming in the backdrop as we increase our investments against generics R&D as well as branded R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX as Rajiv started earlier. So those are the moving parts that lead us to the third quarter. Again, what we're doing is taking a very prudent approach of applying quarterly guidance, given the lumpiness of the year."

And obviously, the message is heard loud and clear with respect to '16. But I guess, and sort of thinking about external expectations in '17, '18 and kind of beyond, it seems like the anticipation at this point is that spend levels remain relatively flat. I'm just kind of wondering how you're thinking about maybe that just in general terms at least directionally."

Let me now turn to our second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here is a brief agenda for today's call. 
Moving to Slide 3. The second quarter was a busy and productive one for us at Endo. I am pleased that we delivered solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter, with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. We also made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. We have made an important addition to the management team, made good progress on key growth drivers and progressed our ongoing legal entity reorganization, which provides us with operational flexibility and benefits. Suky will talk about this reorganization in more detail later in the call. Against the backdrop of this progress, we are taking steps to increase investments in our future organic growth drivers, branded and generics R&D as well as BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotional efforts. Importantly, we are pleased to affirm our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance despite these additional investments. 
On Slide 4, you will see a snapshot of our solid segment results for the second quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me discuss in further detail how we remain focused on operational execution and achieving our key milestones. We announced the appointment of Joe Ciaffoni as our new President of the U.S. Branded business. We are delighted that Joe has joined Endo, bringing his proven expertise in launching and growing branded products and look forward to his contributions when he assumes his new post later this month. 
We continue to drive growth in our generic sterile injectables products, and our Generics Base business is performing right in line with expectations we communicated to you in May of this year. We secured a patent for our largest product, Vasostrict, and continued to launch differentiated generics products and filed new ANDAs with the FDA. 
In our international business, we filed our BELBUCA submission and secured rights to XIAFLEX in Canada. And we have also advanced our branded R&D pipeline and have recently opted into another new potential indication for XIAFLEX Human Lipoma.
So on Slide 6, let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations, which underlie our segment revenue and margin guidance provided in May. We drove continued XIAFLEX demand while abroad, particularly in Peyronie's disease. We are advancing our BELBUCA launch efforts, increasing the total prescriptions to date and growing the number of repeat prescriptions. In the quarter, we also saw better-than-expected results, driven by contracting for the branded Voltaren Gel and performance across some of our other products such as LIDODERM, NASCOBAL and SUPPRELIN LA. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let's take a closer look at XIAFLEX's performance. We are making good progress with this key growth asset, and that is transferring into continued growth. In Peyronie's disease, a market that we think has considerable growth and expansion potential, we delivered nearly 20% demand growth in the second quarter versus the same period last year. We continue to expand our physician/injector base, and our disease awareness campaign, Ask About the Curve, has shown early signs of successfully engaging PD patients. In Dupuytren's contracture, a more mature market and one where XIAFLEX launched more than 5 years ago, we still drove 5% demand growth in the quarter over the second quarter last year. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by greater-than-expected destocking. For the full year 2016, we now expect low double-digit pro forma revenue growth for XIAFLEX. 
On Slide 8, let's move next to International Pharmaceuticals. We continue to drive performance in line with expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we filed our BELBUCA submission and acquired the Canadian rights to XIAFLEX last quarter. Both products are potential long-term growth drivers for the business, and the additions could provide longer-term growth as we manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our operating margins. 
Now to talk about our U.S. Generics performance, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul?"
28071,375875901,1030437,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call. Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all whi",534,"Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call. 
Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all while delivering performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow, led by Vasostrict. Importantly, we also secured a patent for that product that does not expire until 2035 and which we believe further strengthens our market position. And our new launches in alternative dose segment, we've launched 11 products since the beginning of the year and continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. As we expected and in line with trends consistent across the broader generic industry, our base business declined by approximately 5% sequentially from first quarter 2016, driven by consortium pricing pressures in competitive generic entrants. Finally, our adjusted gross margin for the generics business remained in line with expectations. I would like to note that second quarter revenues benefited modestly from some favorable timing between Q2 and Q3, driven by customers advancing some of their orders ahead of the 4th of July holiday. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I'd like to provide you with an update on the action plan that we outlined last quarter to drive long-term growth across our generics portfolio. While I won't go into the detail on each of these items, I do think it's important to note that we are in progress, on track or have already completed all the core components of our action plan. For example, we continue to make progress on key growth drivers like our 505(b)(2) in sterile injectable programs as well as launching a steady stream of new, differentiated products this year. We're also reprioritizing and accelerating our R&D pipeline. We've already rationalized numerous lower-value projects as part of our restructuring and are on track to file approximately 25 to 30 new ANDA submissions in 2016. We made progress on our accelerated restructuring plan for the generics manufacturing network and continue to project approximately $60 million in annual net run rate savings to be fully realized by fourth quarter 2017. We've largely completed the transition of the legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform, including commercial insight, forecasting, wholesaler data management and other capabilities. And finally, we are executing on our operational plan. We have delivered a second quarter that is in line with the expectations that underline our guidance for revenue and adjusted margins previously communicated in May.
So let me talk briefly about our product launches to date and those anticipated for the remainder of the year. 
On Slide 11, you'll see a familiar chart. We have updated it to show all the price we have successfully launched so far in 2016. You can also see those projects that we expect to launch into the marketplace in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are on track for our November and December 2016 launches of generic Seroquel XR and generic Zetia. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our projected outlook. Suky?"
28071,375875901,1030437,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance",1076,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations or C&DI guidance in May. Endo has adopted these guidelines and, as a result, is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. This policy has no impact on Endo's historic or forward-looking GAAP tax or cash tax profile. Also, the initiation of a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter has limited the impact of this change on our adjusted effective tax rate for the year and moving forward. 
Moving to Slide 14, we provided more detail about the legal entity reorganization that I just mentioned. As part of the continued integration of our Qualitest and Par businesses, we initiated a legal entity reorganization that moves the generics business to a new U.S. holding company structure that is separate from the legacy branded business structure. The reorganization provides operating flexibility and benefits while also reducing the potential impact related to future limits on the use of tax attributes by utilizing most of our attributes to offset an intercompany gain. As a result of this reorganization, the tax bases of U.S. Generics business assets have been stepped up to their fair value, which will provide ongoing cash tax benefit and flexibility in moving assets with limited tax leakage. The utilization of acquired attributes that I mentioned earlier would have had an unfavorable impact of approximately $160 million on our full year adjusted tax expense under Endo's non-GAAP policy prior to the adoption of the SEC's C&DI. The elimination of this acquired attribute benefit was offset by an improved mix of jurisdictional adjusted pretax income resulting primarily from the reorganization. This reorg also gave rise to a discrete net GAAP tax benefit of approximately $450 million in the second quarter from outside basis differences. This benefit has been excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with our policy. 
As I talked about earlier, as a result of the SEC's C&DI, Endo is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. However, since we utilized almost all of our tax attributes through the legal entity reorganization,  the implementation of the updated C&DI guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our 2016 and forward-looking adjusted tax rate. Endo continues to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 0 to 2%, as guided, in our first quarter 2016 earnings announcement. We expect to have a GAAP tax benefit and a negative cash tax rate for 2016. Importantly, for our outlook for 2017 and future years, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the high single digits to low double digits and our average cash tax rate to be below 5% over the next 5 years. 
Next, on Slide 15, you will see a snapshot of the second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Rajiv covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. 
On a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $1.75 in the quarter versus a loss of $0.49 in the second quarter of 2015. 2016 second quarter GAAP results were driven by an operating loss of $48 million, offset by the tax benefit that I discussed earlier. Tax benefit also offset the impact of a higher share count in 2016. 
Our GAAP operating loss was largely impacted by a decrease in gross margins due to a higher mix of generic revenue in the second quarter compared to 2015 and due to incremental amortization expense associated with the stepped-up value of intangible assets from Par. On an adjusted basis, overall Q2 results are slightly better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points Rajiv and Paul made, revenue was better than expected due to sterile injectables, stronger-than-expected performance from a number of branded products and a modest timing benefit related to quarter-end buying patterns. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues discussed earlier. 
On Slide 16, while the second quarter was ahead of our guided expectations, we are maintaining our guidance ranges, as some of the upside in the second quarter was driven by favorable timing. As Rajiv mentioned, we are also going to invest at a higher level than originally planned in our key growth drivers in the second half of the year through reallocation of operating expenses and a modest step-up in spending. 
Regarding the cadence of revenues and adjusted earnings in the second half of the year, we continue to project the fourth quarter to be disproportionately larger than the rest of the year's quarters due to the launch of the generics Seroquel and Zetia. For third quarter 2016, we expect revenues in the range of $830 million to $870 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.82. This implies a sequential step-down in third quarter 2016. The anticipated decline is driven by the product order timing benefits in second quarter that we expect to reverse in third quarter, lower U.S. branded sales related to generic competition for Voltaren Gel, continued slowing in the testosterone market, continued declines in legacy pain products and an increased investment in R&D as well as XIAFLEX and BELBUCA promotional efforts. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 17. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP cash flow from operations totaled approximately $555 million. We have also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our reported or GAAP cash flows for the year. 
On Slide 18, we are reiterating our view on cash available to pay down debt in 2016. We continue to project debt pay-down of approximately $250 million in 2016 and to exit the year at a mid- to high 4x net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $670 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $390 million in restricted cash and a net debt-to-leverage ratio of approximately 4.6x. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by our second quarter financial results and pleased to affirm our full year outlook while increasing investment in key growth drivers. 
Now to close out the call, let me turn it back over to Rajiv. Rajiv?"

Moving to Slide 20. In summary, there are a number of key growth drivers that position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We believe strongly in the significant in-market growth opportunities for both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to optimize our team and our business to achieve their growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of other products. We are also accelerating our R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. We continue to execute on these growth drivers in the second quarter and expect to achieve additional key milestones through the end of this year and beyond. 
On Slide 21, let's recap the key achievements in our U.S. Generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated, higher barrier-to-entry products like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs for restructuring. We have a diversified reset base business and a robust, highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they continue to execute on these opportunities. 
Let's briefly summarize our call today on Slide 22. In Q2, we delivered solid top and adjusted bottom line results, beating our Q2 adjusted results guidance. We made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. And we are affirming our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance while increasing our investment in branded and generic R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotion. Endo is executing on our strategic priorities, and we continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for the company, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me now turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period. Keri?"

Louise, let me address the first 2 questions, and I will have Paul address the third one. So in XIAFLEX, as we have commented in the past, the growth profile does tend to be a little bit lumpy and have some seasonal fluctuations to it. So as you might recall, we had a very robust growth in the first quarter. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in Dupuytren's contracture in the second quarter. But as we look out over the remainder of the year, we do feel confident in the double-digit growth trajectory that we have talked about. Now in terms of the revenue profile, as you know, customer stocking is largely out of our control, though, typically, XIAFLEX stocking in the specialty distributors and the specialty pharmacies, in general, is around 14 days, about 2 weeks. But from time to time, we do see some unusual changes to it, which is what happened in the second quarter. Our stocking is around 1 week, so approximately half of what it typically is. Now we have seen this behavior in the past, and typically, over the course of the year, it tends to normalize. But by and large, it is out of our control. So what we look to is demand while growth. And that's where when we look at the 19% growth in Peyronie's, we do feel very good about this indication, given that from a longer-term perspective, for our on-market indications, the biggest opportunity is in Peyronie's. In terms of divestments of non-core assets, I just wanted to be clear that from a company perspective, we don't feel compelled to divest any assets. We are confident in our business and the natural delevering nature of the business, given the -- our substantial cash flows, particularly as we look beyond the known mesh payments in '16 and '17. That being said, I think we've also been clear that as a company and as a board, we are always -- we are shareholder-friendly. And when there are any opportunities that come our way that are value-creating, we will certainly evaluate them on a standard basis. Paul, maybe you can comment on the Qualitest business."

That also includes some of the Par portfolio. When you look at that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we communicated this at our last earnings call, that we were anticipating about 5% erosion quarter-over-quarter, and that's exactly where we landed. So it's in line with our expectations and how we communicated. So generally, our base business is falling in line, and we're not seeing the heavy erosion that we realized in Q1."

So in BELBUCA, the feedback continues to be similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, which is positive feedback from physicians, positive feedback into the patient experience. The 2 areas which are leading to slow uptake of the product beyond just the overall environment in opioid, one is the process of getting physician community comfortable with the tapering and titrating requirements in terms of switching patients between different opioids and onto BELBUCA. And secondly, it's around the payer environment and how they see the Schedule III products. So on the latter, we made good progress. At this point, we have contracted roughly around 85% of commercial lives, and about 70% of that at -- without any restrictions beyond the label, we expect to continue to improve that over the course of the year. But, of course, at this point, in launch of a product like this, we don't yet have [indiscernible] reimbursement. But what we see as being the real opportunity is the pharmacoeconomic and public health argument for why Schedule III product like BELBUCA is preferable to other opioids such as the Schedule II products in terms of where it is introduced in the treatment algorithm. And a lot of the investment that we are now making is around improving our fact base in terms of making those market access arguments. Clearly, we still continue to have a large investment from a field force standpoint, and that continues. We're also increasing our investment around physician education, particularly around the treatment and titrating of the product.

That being said, we have -- we will not be making any particular prediction around '17 and beyond. But I would say that we are very optimistic when we look at the current results that we are seeing in Peyronie's disease, which we think is the great opportunity for the 2 -- of the 2 on-market indications. And there are 3 areas in which we have made promotion investments and we expect to step up for the remainder of the year as well as going into '17, and they will be following. One is an area which we already talked about, which is that we continue to need to make the lives of patients who currently prescribe the product easy. And then that's mostly around reimbursement support. And we've substantially increased the level of internal resourcing around that as well as targeted third parties to support that. The second is a longer-term opportunity around disease awareness building. And we have begun to do piloting and early investments, particularly in Peyronie's, through our online campaign, Ask About the Curve. And it's, of course, too early to fully realize the benefit from it or fully conclude what the benefits will look like. But the early signs of web click-throughs and patient interest in going on to our site of physicians selected, for example, substantial uptick in that, right? Now, clearly, for a product like this, the cycle from the time you get a patient interest in the product or interest in going to physician, to the time that he would have a first injection could be 6 to 9 months, right, which is why we always pointed to the back half of this year '17 before we really begin to see the benefit from it. And the third thing I would say is, and this is probably more so true for Dupuytren's contracture than Peyronie's, is the need to make a compelling argument around the pharmacoeconomic benefits of a intervention like XIAFLEX versus surgery. And that's more of a opportunity for us in Dupuytren's contracture, where the hand surgeons who treat the condition often see surgical option as a -- as the first option. And we've, of course, had very good success with the product with these physicians. But getting to the next level is going to require making an even strong argument around why this is the best interest of patients."

Obviously, we got Orange Book patent listed in June. I think it was June 28. The way we kind of look at this product right now simply is from 2 different views. There was always a possibility that there could be a file that was issued with the FDA pre-Orange Book patent listing, and that's something where maybe we feel a little bit better about. And typically, what happened is if an application was in at the FDA for several months prior to the Orange Book listing, what you would expect is for a generic competitor to file a Paragraph IV very quickly and then we would have been noticed. That didn't happen from that standpoint. We feel a little bit better. If an application went on file a month or 2, pre-June 28 or shortly thereafter, that's where we're not going to have that visibility. But if we were to get a Paragraph IV, say, today, it would take about 60 to 90 days for an application to be accepted for filing. So we would probably look to be in a 30-month stay, ticking somewhere late fourth quarter. That's the way I would start looking at it. So from that standpoint, we had originally said that we felt good through 2017. We probably will be in a position to say that we feel a little bit good through 2018, but we'll have better visibility around fourth quarter. In terms of the generic pipeline, from a standpoint of where we feel real good about, I think we'd like to focus a little bit on the 505(b)(2) side. I think that's an area of strength of the company, right? So while we haven't disclosed specifics, we do have a series of 505(b)(2)s that are starting to come through to fruition. And frankly, maybe we can talk a little bit more in terms of products that we feel a little bit better about. We had previously talked about 2 505(b)(2)s that we did not shed a lot of light on. We feel little bit better about them now. They are 2 forms of potassium. One is a liquid, and one is a powder form. We have started to receive positive feedback from the FDA in terms of removing unapproved sources. That's going to come to an end, whereby these unapproved sources will have the remainder of 2016 or so to have product into the market. These types of products will show benefit to Par and Endo in 2017. So that's an area that we'd like to focus in on. Thank you."

So for BELBUCA in the first couple of quarters, we've been clear that we think we are using a pull-through method to recognize revenue. So it has been minimal revenue recognition in the first half of the year, so single-digit millions. And the -- we've also been clear that given our launch ramp expectations that we expect the contributions in 2016, in total, to be relatively modest. So we would look to 2017, really as the first year of revenue contributions for BELBUCA, and I would be clear about what those expectations are at the appropriate time. In terms of pricing, and I'll let Paul answer the specific question in retrospect, but I will point out the following, which is, from an overall perspective, the Endo business benefits from volume, not price. And in particular, generics business has predominantly more price pressure than upward price potential. And if any prices -- any price increase that we might be able to take on the true generics part of it as, this is all owned by the price erosion that we see on the base business. Now products like Vasostrict are a little different, in that they are sold on the basis of NDA, although they are sold within Par. But even in those cases, we take a responsible approach to price increases. And just because we have flexibility, does not mean that we will take a price increase. In the case of Vasostrict, the Par has been very thoughtful about how to price the product as the NDA. If we're a life-saving product, it is still in the low hundreds in terms -- sorry, about 125 or so, plus or minus, in terms of what unit costs. And a substantial amount of investment also gone into our Rochester, Michigan facility to support this product and CapEx in excess of $100 million. And from a forward-looking standpoint, our philosophy on price increases will not change, which is that we will be responsible about how we think about it. But Paul, maybe you have a specific commentary on Vasostrict."

And in essence, 20% of our overall CapEx goes into the Rochester facility to keep it compliant. It's a big commitment specifically on this injectable, that product that's a live-saving product. And then in terms of like general price increases and whatnot, I think, again, when you look at the total generics business, in essence, we are a volume-driven company, to Rajiv's point. When you want to look at it as then, as one-off on a product-specific, in the case of this one product, it's true that we have taken some price increases, but they had been responsible.

And then David, to your question on the generics fair value, you're correct.

That is the tax basis of those assets, which provides ongoing and durable cash tax benefit, and also provides flexibility in our ability to move those assets throughout our legal entities without residual tax leakage, which is our policy. We don't talk to specific asset values, but directionally, the way to think about how we value them is on future value based on discounted cash flows of our outlook for each of the products.

I think Par was fairly hard because the type of portfolio that we had, which was a, for the most part, a commoditized business. And we had to make certain and tough decisions based upon how we started looking at products on a go-forward basis. And we were also a little bit on the volume side versus a value side. And we made a conscious decision to start to look towards more difficult-to-make products. Now that's something that we've executed very, very well on, and that's where we're looking at our total portfolio. Now immediate-release products are always going to be important to Par, right? And that's going to help build volume incentives for wholesalers. But we're looking for longevity, and that's why you're going to see us move more towards the alternative dosage forms, the injectable forms and continue with the Paragraph IV side. That is a key difference from today versus where we were back in 2008. The challenge that we have today is the consortiums. The consortiums have gotten bigger and stronger, and that goes right back to having the execute on, on the earlier statement that I made, is the companies that are going to survive and do well are the companies that going to have compliance across-the-board, something that we've done very, very well. We spend an enormous amount of resources in CapEx and to compliance, service levels and execution on the R&D side. And there was a question on controlled substances. So controlled substances, again, an important part of the overall portfolio, but it's not the barrier that it once was. And I think, with the consortiums getting larger, they have allowed some new players to come into market and get quota. We talked about this in the past.

But on a whole year basis, they're not meaningful. But having said that, given our reset in Q1 and given the launches that we've got in fourth quarter, we are providing quarterly guidance at least for this year. For the third quarter, the way to think about the step-down is, one, you talked about already, which is the stocking that we saw in the second quarter. Our assumption is that reverses in the third quarter. Also, what underpins our assumption of the step-down is continued erosion in retail as that continues to face competition from a generic standpoint. We would expect LIDODERM to step down modestly. Our testosterone products continue to decline quarter-over-quarter, particularly because of the market. And then, again, we also expect to see some modest decline in our pain products. All of those declines are partially offset by growth in XIAFLEX and BELBUCA as well as Par launches. But net-net, our assumptions lead us to a decline on revenue into the third quarter. From an investment standpoint, that's all coming in the backdrop as we increase our investments against generics R&D as well as branded R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX, as Rajiv has talked about earlier. So those are the moving parts that lead us to the third quarter. Again, what we're doing is taking a very prudent approach of applying quarterly guidance, given the lumpiness of the year."

So the, in terms of the FDA's own determination of what constitutes it does in a lot of debate. We don't have a crystal ball, and we'll be speculating. But, with certainly, as we look forward, on a longer-term perspective, one would think that the long-acting products would transition to more abuse deterrent formulations, but is that going to happen in the short term, that is anyone's guess."

There are 100 million patients who suffer from chronic pain, and there are certain categories of pain, such as cancer pain, that you are going to need an opioid in order to survive and manage that kind of pain, right?

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here is a brief agenda for today's call. 
Moving to Slide 3. The second quarter was a busy and productive one for us at Endo. I am pleased that we delivered solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter, with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. We also made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. We have made an important addition to the management team, made good progress on key growth drivers and progressed our ongoing legal entity reorganization, which provides us with operational flexibility and benefits. Suky will talk about this reorganization in more detail later in the call. Against the backdrop of this progress, we are taking steps to increase investments in our future organic growth drivers, branded and generics R&D as well as BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotional efforts. Importantly, we are pleased to affirm our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance despite these additional investments. 
On Slide 4, you will see a snapshot of our solid segment results for the second quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me discuss in further detail how we remain focused on operational execution and achieving our key milestones. We announced the appointment of Joe Ciaffoni as our new President of the U.S. Branded business. We are delighted that Joe has joined Endo, bringing his proven expertise in launching and growing branded products and look forward to his contributions when he assumes his new post later this month. 
We continue to drive growth in our generic sterile injectables products, and our Generics Base business is performing right in line with expectations we communicated to you in May of this year. We secured a patent for our largest product, Vasostrict, and continue to launch differentiated generics products and file new ANDAs with the FDA. 
In our international business, we filed our BELBUCA submission and secured rights to XIAFLEX in Canada. And we have also advanced our branded R&D pipeline and have recently opted into another new potential indication for XIAFLEX, human lipoma.
So on Slide 6, let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations, which underlie our segment revenue and margin guidance provided in May. We drove continued XIAFLEX demand by a broad -- particularly in Peyronie's disease. We are advancing our BELBUCA launch efforts, increasing the total prescriptions to date and growing the number of repeat prescriptions. In the quarter, we also saw better-than-expected results, driven by contracting for the branded Voltaren Gel and performance across some of our other products such as LIDODERM, NASCOBAL and SUPPRELIN LA. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let's take a closer look at XIAFLEX's performance. We are making good progress with this key growth asset, and that is transferring into continued growth. In Peyronie's disease, a market that we think has considerable growth and expansion potential, we delivered nearly 20% demand growth in the second quarter versus the same period last year. We continue to expand our physician/injector base, and our disease awareness campaign, Ask About the Curve, has shown early signs of successfully engaging PD patients. In Dupuytren's contracture, a more mature market and one where XIAFLEX launched more than 5 years ago, we still drove 5% demand growth in the quarter over the second quarter last year. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by greater-than-expected destocking. For the full year 2016, we now expect low double-digit pro forma revenue growth for XIAFLEX. 
On Slide 8, let's move next to International Pharmaceuticals. We continue to drive performance in line with expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we filed our BELBUCA submission and acquired the Canadian rights to XIAFLEX last quarter. Both products are potential long-term growth drivers for the business, and the additions could provide longer-term growth as we manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our operating margins. 
Now to talk about our U.S. Generics performance, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul?"

Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all while delivering performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow, led by Vasostrict. Importantly, we also secured a patent for that product that does not expire until 2035 and which we believe further strengthens our market position. In our new launches in alternative dosage segment, we've launched 11 products since the beginning of the year and continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. As we expected and in line with trends consistent across the broader generic industry, our base business declined by approximately 5% sequentially from first quarter 2016, driven by consortium pricing pressures in competitive generic entrants. Finally, our adjusted gross margin for the generics business remained in line with expectations. I would like to note that second quarter revenues benefited modestly from some favorable timing between Q2 and Q3, driven by customers advancing some of their orders ahead of the 4th of July holiday. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I'd like to provide you with an update on the action plan that we outlined last quarter to drive long-term growth across our generics portfolio. While I won't go into the detail on each of these items, I do think it's important to note that we are in progress, on track or have already completed all the core components of our action plan. For example, we continue to make progress on key growth drivers like our 505(b)(2) in sterile injectable programs as well as launching a steady stream of new, differentiated products this year. We're also reprioritizing and accelerating our R&D pipeline. We've already rationalized numerous lower-value projects as part of our restructuring and are on track to file approximately 25 to 30 new ANDA submissions in 2016. We made progress on our accelerated restructuring plan for the generics manufacturing network and continue to project approximately $60 million in annual net run rate savings to be fully realized by fourth quarter 2017. We've largely completed the transition of the legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform, including commercial insight, forecasting, wholesaler data management and other capabilities. And finally, we are executing on our operational plan. We have delivered a second quarter that is in line with the expectations that underlie our guidance for revenue and adjusted margins previously communicated in May.
So let me talk briefly about our product launches to date and those anticipated for the remainder of the year. 
On Slide 11, you'll see a familiar chart. We have updated it to show all the products we have successfully launched so far in 2016. You can also see those products that we expect to launch into the marketplace in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are on track for our November and December 2016 launches of generic Seroquel XR and generic Zetia. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our projected outlook. Suky?"
28071,375875901,1030532,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance",1080,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations or C&DI guidance in May. Endo has adopted these guidelines and, as a result, is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. This policy has no impact on Endo's historic or forward-looking GAAP tax or cash tax profile. Also, the initiation of a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter has limited the impact of this change on our adjusted effective tax rate for the year and moving forward. 
Moving to Slide 14, we provided more detail about the legal entity reorganization that I just mentioned. As part of the continued integration of our Qualitest and Par businesses, we initiated a legal entity reorganization that moves the generics business to a new U.S. holding company structure that is separate from the legacy branded business structure. The reorganization provides operating flexibility and benefits while also reducing the potential impact related to future limits on the use of tax attributes by utilizing most of our attributes to offset an intercompany gain. As a result of this reorganization, the tax bases of U.S. Generics business assets have been stepped up to their fair value, which will provide ongoing cash tax benefit and flexibility in moving assets with limited tax leakage. The utilization of acquired attributes that I mentioned earlier would have had an unfavorable impact of approximately $160 million on our full year adjusted tax expense under Endo's non-GAAP policy prior to the adoption of the SEC's C&DI. The elimination of this acquired attribute benefit was offset by an improved mix of jurisdictional adjusted pretax income resulting primarily from the reorganization. This reorg also gave rise to a discrete net GAAP tax benefit of approximately $450 million in the second quarter from outside basis differences. This benefit has been excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with our policy. 
As I talked about earlier, as a result of the SEC's C&DI, Endo is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. However, since we utilized almost all of our tax attributes through the legal entity reorganization,  the implementation of the updated C&DI guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our 2016 and forward-looking adjusted tax rate. Endo continues to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 0 to 2%, as guided in our first quarter 2016 earnings announcement. We expect to have a GAAP tax benefit and a negative cash tax rate for 2016. Importantly, for our outlook for 2017 and future years, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the high single digits to low double digits and our average cash tax rate to be below 5% over the next 5 years. 
Next, on Slide 15, you will see a snapshot of the second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Rajiv covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. 
On a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $1.75 in the quarter versus a loss of $0.49 in the second quarter of 2015. 2016 second quarter GAAP results were driven by an operating loss of $48 million, offset by the tax benefit that I discussed earlier. Tax benefit also offset the impact of a higher share count in 2016. 
Our GAAP operating loss was largely impacted by a decrease in gross margins due to a higher mix of generic revenue in the second quarter compared to 2015 and due to incremental amortization expense associated with the stepped-up value of intangible assets from Par. On an adjusted basis, overall Q2 results are slightly better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points Rajiv and Paul made, revenue was better than expected due to sterile injectables, stronger-than-expected performance from a number of branded products and a modest timing benefit related to quarter-end buying patterns. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues discussed earlier. 
On Slide 16, while the second quarter was ahead of our guided expectations, we are maintaining our guidance ranges, as some of the upside in the second quarter was driven by favorable timing. As Rajiv mentioned, we are also going to invest at a higher level than originally planned in our key growth drivers in the second half of the year through a reallocation of operating expenses and a modest step-up in spending. 
Regarding the cadence of revenues and adjusted earnings in the second half of the year, we continue to project the fourth quarter to be disproportionately larger than the rest of the year's quarters due to the launch of the generics Seroquel and Zetia. For third quarter 2016, we expect revenues in the range of $830 million to $870 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.82. This implies a sequential step-down in third quarter of 2016. The anticipated decline is driven by the product order timing benefits in the second quarter that we expect to reverse in the third quarter, lower U.S. branded sales related to generic competition for Voltaren Gel, continued slowing in the testosterone market, continued declines in legacy pain products and an increased investment in R&D as well as XIAFLEX and BELBUCA promotional efforts. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 17. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP cash flow from operations totaled approximately $555 million. We have also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our reported or GAAP cash flows for the year. 
On Slide 18, we are reiterating our view on cash available to pay down debt in 2016. We continue to project debt pay-down of approximately $250 million in 2016 and to exit the year at a mid- to high 4x net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $670 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $390 million in restricted cash and a net debt-to-leverage ratio of approximately 4.6x. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by our second quarter financial results and pleased to affirm our full year outlook while increasing investment in key growth drivers. 
Now to close out the call, let me turn it back over to Rajiv. Rajiv?"

Moving to Slide 20. In summary, there are a number of key growth drivers that position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We believe strongly in the significant in-market growth opportunities for both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to optimize our team and our business to achieve their growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of other products. We are also accelerating our R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. We continue to execute on these growth drivers in the second quarter and expect to achieve additional key milestones through the end of this year and beyond. 
On Slide 21, let's recap the key achievements in our U.S. Generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated, higher barrier-to-entry products like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs for restructuring. We have a diversified reset base business and a robust, highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they continue to execute on these opportunities. 
Let's briefly summarize our call today on Slide 22. In Q2, we delivered solid top and adjusted bottom line results, beating our Q2 adjusted results guidance. We made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. And we are affirming our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance while increasing our investment in branded and generic R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotion. Endo is executing on our strategic priorities, and we continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for the company, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders.

Louise, let me address the first 2 questions, and I will have Paul address the third one. So in XIAFLEX, as we have commented in the past, the growth profile does tend to be a little bit lumpy and have some seasonal fluctuations to it. So as you might recall, we had a very robust growth in the first quarter. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in Dupuytren's contracture in the second quarter. But as we look out over the remainder of the year, we do feel confident in the double-digit growth trajectory that we have talked about. Now in terms of the revenue profile, as you know, customer stocking is largely out of our control, though, typically, XIAFLEX stocking in the specialty distributors and the specialty pharmacies, in general, is around 14 days, about 2 weeks. But from time to time, we do see some unusual changes to it, which is what happened in the second quarter. Our stocking is around 1 week, so approximately half of what it typically is. Now we have seen this behavior in the past, and typically, over the course of the year, it tends to normalize. But by and large, it is out of our control. So what we look to is demand while growth. And that's where when we look at the 19% growth in Peyronie's, we do feel very good about this indication, given that from a longer-term perspective, for our on-market indications, the biggest opportunity is in Peyronie's. In terms of divestments of non-core assets, I just wanted to be clear that from a company perspective, we don't feel compelled to divest any assets. We are confident in our business and the natural delevering nature of the business, given the -- our substantial cash flows, particularly as we look beyond the known mesh payments in '16 and '17. That being said, I think we've also been clear that as a company and as a board, we are always -- we are shareholder-friendly. And when there are any opportunities that come our way that are value-creating, we will certainly evaluate them on a -- our standard basis. Paul, maybe you can comment on the Qualitest business."

So in BELBUCA, the feedback continues to be similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, which is positive feedback from physicians, positive feedback into the patient experience. The 2 areas which are leading to slow uptake of the product beyond just the overall environment in opioid, one is the process of getting the physician community comfortable with the tapering and titrating requirements in terms of switching patients between different opioids and onto BELBUCA. And secondly, it's around the payer environment and how they see the Schedule III products. So on the latter, we made good progress. At this point, we have contracted roughly around 85% of commercial lives, and about 70% of that at -- without any restrictions beyond the label, we expect to continue to improve that over the course of the year. But, of course, at this point, in a launch of a product like this, we don't yet have government reimbursement. But what we see as being the real opportunity is the pharmacoeconomic and public health argument for why a Schedule III product like BELBUCA is preferable to other opioids such as the Schedule II products in terms of where it is introduced in the treatment algorithm. And a lot of the investment that we are now making is around improving our fact base in terms of making those market access arguments. Clearly, we still continue to have a large investment from a field force standpoint, and that continues. We're also increasing our investment around physician education, particularly around the treatment and titrating of the product. But really, the upside benefit and the longer-term growth of the product is really predicated on us being able to really anchor buprenorphine as a effective and safe alternative in the opioid space, both on a peer standpoint as well as from a physician standpoint."

That being said, we have -- we will not be making any particular prediction around '17 and beyond. But I would say that we are very optimistic when we look at the current results that we are seeing in Peyronie's disease, which we think is the great opportunity for the 2 -- of the 2 on-market indications. And there are 3 areas in which we have made promotion investments and we expect to step up for the remainder of the year as well as going into '17, and they will be the following. One is an area which we already talked about, which is that we continue to need to make the lives of patients who currently are prescribed the product easy. And then that's mostly around reimbursement support. And we've substantially increased the level of internal resourcing around that as well as targeted third parties to support that. The second is a longer-term opportunity around disease awareness building. And we have begun to do piloting and early investments, particularly in Peyronie's, through our online campaign, Ask About the Curve. And it's, of course, too early to fully realize the benefit from it or fully conclude what the benefits will look like. But the early signs of web click-throughs and patient interest in going onto our site to a physician selector, for example, there's been substantial uptick in that, right? Now, clearly, for a product like this, the cycle from the time you get a patient interested in the product or interest in going to physician, to the time that he would have a first injection could be 6 to 9 months, right, which is why we always pointed to the back half of this year '17 before we really begin to see the benefit from it. And the third thing I would say is -- and this is probably more so true for Dupuytren's contracture than Peyronie's, is the need to make a compelling argument around the pharmacoeconomic benefits of a intervention like XIAFLEX versus surgery. And that's more of an opportunity for us in Dupuytren's contracture, where the hand surgeons who treat the condition often see the surgical option as a -- as the first option. And we've, of course, had very good success with the product with these physicians. But getting to the next level is going to require making an even strong argument around why this is the best interest of patients."

Obviously, we got the Orange Book patent listed in June. I think it was June 28. The way we kind of look at this product right now simply is from 2 different views. There was always a possibility that there could be a file that was issued with the FDA pre-Orange Book patent listing, and that's something where maybe we feel a little bit better about. And typically, what happened is if an application was in at the FDA for several months prior to the Orange Book listing, what you would expect is for a generic competitor to file a Paragraph IV very quickly and then we would have been noticed. That didn't happen; from that standpoint. We feel a little bit better. If an application went on file a month or 2, pre-June 28 or shortly thereafter, that's where we're not going to have that visibility. But if we were to get a Paragraph IV, say, today, it would take about 60 to 90 days for an application to be accepted for filing. So we would probably look to be in a 30-month stay, ticking somewhere late fourth quarter. That's the way I would start looking at it. So from that standpoint, we had originally said that we felt good through 2017. We probably will be in a position to say that we feel a little bit good through 2018, but we'll have better visibility around fourth quarter. In terms of the generic pipeline, from a standpoint of where we feel real good about, I think we'd like to focus a little bit on the 505(b)(2) side. I think that's an area of strength of the company, right? So while we haven't disclosed specifics, we do have a series of 505(b)(2)s that are starting to come through to fruition. And frankly, maybe we can talk a little bit more in terms of products that we feel a little bit better about. We had previously talked about 2 505(b)(2)s that we did not shed a lot of light on. We feel little bit better about them now. They are 2 forms of potassium. One is a liquid, and one is a powder form. We have started to receive positive feedback from the FDA in terms of removing unapproved sources. That's going to come to an end, whereby these unapproved sources will have the remainder of 2016 or so to have product into the market. These types of products will show benefit to Par and Endo in 2017. So that's an area that we'd like to focus in on. Thank you."

So for BELBUCA in the first couple of quarters, we've been clear that we think we are using a pull-through method to recognize revenue. So it has been minimal revenue recognition in the first half of the year, so single-digit millions. And the -- we've also been clear that given our launch ramp expectations that we expect the contributions in 2016, in total, to be relatively modest. So we would look to 2017, really as the first year of revenue contributions for BELBUCA, and I would be clear about what those expectations are at the appropriate time. In terms of pricing, and I'll let Paul answer the specific question in retrospect, but I will point out the following, which is, from an overall perspective, the Endo business benefits from volume, not price. And in particular, generics business has predominantly more price pressure than upward price potential. And any prices -- any price increase that we might be able to take on the true generics part of it as -- is overwhelmed by the price erosion that we see on the base business. Now products like Vasostrict are a little different, in that they are sold on the basis of NDA, although they are sold within Par. But even in those cases, we take a responsible approach to price increases. And just because we have flexibility does not mean that we will take a price increase. In the case of Vasostrict, the Par has been very thoughtful about how to price the product as an NDA. And, for a life-saving product, it is still in the low hundreds in terms -- sorry, about 125 or so, plus or minus, in terms of what a unit costs. And a substantial amount of investment has also gone into our Rochester, Michigan facility to support this product, and CapEx in excess of $100 million. And from a forward-looking standpoint, our philosophy on price increases will not change, which is that we will be responsible about how we think about it. But Paul, maybe you have a specific commentary on Vasostrict."

And in essence, 20% of our overall CapEx goes into the Rochester facility to keep it compliant. So it's a big commitment specifically on this injectable, that product that's a life-saving product. And then in terms of like general price increases and whatnot, I think, again, when you look at the total generics business, in essence, we are a volume-driven company, to Rajiv's point. When you want to look at it as a one-off on a product-specific, in the case of this one product, it's true that we have taken some price increases, but they had been responsible.

I think Par was hit fairly hard because the type of portfolio that we had, which was a, for the most part, a commoditized business. And we had to make certain and tough decisions based upon how we started looking at products on a go-forward basis. And we were also a little bit on the volume side versus a value side. And we made a conscious decision to start to look towards more difficult-to-make products. Now that's something that we've executed very, very well on, and that's where we're looking at our total portfolio. Now immediate-release products are always going to be important to Par, right? And that's going to help build volume incentives for wholesalers. But we're looking for longevity, and that's why you're going to see us move more towards the alternative dosage forms, the injectable forms and continue with the Paragraph IV side. That is a key difference from today versus where we were back in 2008. The challenge that we have today is the consortiums. The consortiums have gotten bigger and stronger, and that goes right back to having to execute on -- on the earlier statement that I made, is the companies that are going to survive and do well are the companies that going to have compliance across-the-board, something that we've done very, very well.

But we also have a series of smaller products that we don't talk much about, that are also doing quite well, that are promoted. SUPPRELIN L.A. has been a very sticky and very good performance for us for a long period of time. NASCOBAL, which is a product that came over with the Par transaction and is a branded product that's promoted by our field force, is also doing quite well, right? So as we look across the portfolio, in the branded business, beyond the ones that we actually talk about, we do see points of good performance, which -- which just helped us in Q2 and we expect to help us over the course and remainder of the year as well."

And it's Suky, on your question around the third quarter sequential reduction, the first thing I would say is, generally as a default, we tend to prefer not to give quarterly guidance because there are a lot of things that can affect a quarter, specifically around timing that could be material to the quarter. But on a whole year basis, they're not meaningful. But having said that, given our reset in Q1 and given the launches that we've got in fourth quarter, we are providing quarterly guidance at least for this year. For the third quarter, the way to think about the step-down is, one, you talked about already, which is the stocking that we saw in the second quarter. Our assumption is that reverses in the third quarter. Also, what underpins our assumption of the step-down is continued erosion in retail as that continues to face competition from a generic standpoint. We would expect LIDODERM to step down modestly. Our testosterone products continue to decline quarter-over-quarter, particularly because of the market. And then, again, we also expect to see some modest decline in our pain products. All of those declines are partially offset by growth in XIAFLEX and BELBUCA as well as Par launches. But net-net, our assumptions lead us to a decline on revenue into the third quarter. From an investment standpoint, that's all coming in the backdrop as we increase our investments against generics R&D as well as branded R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX, as Rajiv has talked about earlier. So those are the moving parts that lead us to the third quarter. Again, what we're doing is taking a very prudent approach of applying quarterly guidance, given the lumpiness of the year."

I hope that you have all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here is a brief agenda for today's call. 
Moving to Slide 3. The second quarter was a busy and productive one for us at Endo. I am pleased that we delivered solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter, with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. We also made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. We have made an important addition to the management team, made good progress on key growth drivers and progressed our ongoing legal entity reorganization, which provides us with operational flexibility and benefits. Suky will talk about this reorganization in more detail later in the call. Against the backdrop of this progress, we are taking steps to increase investments in our future organic growth drivers, branded and generics R&D as well as BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotional efforts. Importantly, we are pleased to affirm our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance despite these additional investments. 
On Slide 4, you will see a snapshot of our solid segment results for the second quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let me discuss in further detail how we remain focused on operational execution and achieving our key milestones. We announced the appointment of Joe Ciaffoni as our new President of the U.S. Branded business. We are delighted that Joe has joined Endo, bringing his proven expertise in launching and growing branded products and look forward to his contributions when he assumes his new post later this month. 
We continue to drive growth in our generic sterile injectables products, and our Generics Base business is performing right in line with expectations we communicated to you in May of this year. We secured a patent for our largest product, Vasostrict, and continue to launch differentiated generics products and file new ANDAs with the FDA. 
In our international business, we filed our BELBUCA submission and secured rights to XIAFLEX in Canada. And we have also advanced our branded R&D pipeline and have recently opted into another new potential indication for XIAFLEX, human lipoma.
So on Slide 6, let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations, which underlie our segment revenue and margin guidance provided in May. We drove continued XIAFLEX demand by a broad -- particularly in Peyronie's disease. We are advancing our BELBUCA launch efforts, increasing the total prescriptions to date and growing the number of repeat prescriptions. In the quarter, we also saw better-than-expected results, driven by contracting for the branded Voltaren Gel and performance across some of our other products such as LIDODERM, NASCOBAL and SUPPRELIN LA. 
Moving to Slide 7. Let's take a closer look at XIAFLEX's performance. We are making good progress with this key growth asset, and that is transferring into continued growth. In Peyronie's disease, a market that we think has considerable growth and expansion potential, we delivered nearly 20% demand growth in the second quarter versus the same period last year. We continue to expand our physician/injector base, and our disease awareness campaign, Ask About the Curve, has shown early signs of successfully engaging PD patients. In Dupuytren's contracture, a more mature market and one where XIAFLEX launched more than 5 years ago, we still drove 5% demand growth in the quarter over the second quarter last year. Revenues for the quarter were impacted by greater-than-expected destocking. For the full year 2016, we now expect low double-digit pro forma revenue growth for XIAFLEX. 
On Slide 8, let's move next to International Pharmaceuticals. We continue to drive performance in line with expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we filed our BELBUCA submission and acquired the Canadian rights to XIAFLEX last quarter. Both products are potential long-term growth drivers for the business, and the additions could provide longer-term growth as we manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our operating margins. 
Now to talk about our U.S. Generics performance, let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul?"

Turning to Slide 9.

Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on the continued integration of Par and Qualitest, advancing our pipeline and restructuring our manufacturing footprint for improved margins, all while delivering performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow, led by Vasostrict. Importantly, we also secured a patent for that product that does not expire until 2035 and which we believe further strengthens our market position. In our new launches in alternative dosage segment, we've launched 11 products since the beginning of the year and continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. As we expected and in line with trends consistent across the broader generic industry, our base business declined by approximately 5% sequentially from first quarter 2016, driven by consortium pricing pressures in competitive generic entrants. Finally, our adjusted gross margin for the generics business remained in line with expectations. I would like to note that second quarter revenues benefited modestly from some favorable timing between Q2 and Q3, driven by customers advancing some of their orders ahead of the 4th of July holiday. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I'd like to provide you with an update on the action plan that we outlined last quarter to drive long-term growth across our generics portfolio. While I won't go into the detail on each of these items, I do think it's important to note that we are in progress, on track or have already completed all the core components of our action plan. For example, we continue to make progress on key growth drivers like our 505(b)(2) in sterile injectable programs as well as launching a steady stream of new, differentiated products this year. We're also reprioritizing and accelerating our R&D pipeline. We've already rationalized numerous lower-value projects as part of our restructuring and are on track to file approximately 25 to 30 new ANDA submissions in 2016. We made progress on our accelerated restructuring plan for the generics manufacturing network and continue to project approximately $60 million in annual net run rate savings to be fully realized by fourth quarter 2017. We've largely completed the transition of the legacy Qualitest business onto the Par platform, including commercial insight, forecasting, wholesaler data management and other capabilities. And finally, we are executing on our operational plan. We have delivered a second quarter that is in line with the expectations that underlie our guidance for revenue and adjusted margins previously communicated in May.
So let me talk briefly about our product launches to date and those anticipated for the remainder of the year. 
On Slide 11, you'll see a familiar chart. We have updated it to show all the products we have successfully launched so far in 2016. You can also see those products that we expect to launch into the marketplace in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are on track for our November and December 2016 launches of generic Seroquel XR and generic Zetia. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Suky to discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our projected outlook. Suky?"
28071,375875901,1031900,"Endo International plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance",1080,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 13, where we've outlined finance updates around the recent SEC guidelines and our adjusted effective tax rate policy moving forward. As you're aware, the FCC issued non-GAAP Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations or C&DI guidance in May. Endo has adopted these guidelines and, as a result, is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. This policy has no impact on Endo's historic or forward-looking GAAP tax or cash tax profile. Also, the initiation of a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter has limited the impact of this change on our adjusted effective tax rate for the year and moving forward. 
Moving to Slide 14, we provided more detail about the legal entity reorganization that I just mentioned. As part of the continued integration of our Qualitest and Par businesses, we initiated a legal entity reorganization that moves the generics business to a new U.S. holding company structure that is separate from the legacy branded business structure. The reorganization provides operating flexibility and benefits while also reducing the potential impact related to future limits on the use of tax attributes by utilizing most of our attributes to offset an intercompany gain. As a result of this reorganization, the tax bases of U.S. Generics business assets have been stepped up to their fair value, which will provide ongoing cash tax benefit and flexibility in moving assets with limited tax leakage. The utilization of acquired attributes that I mentioned earlier would have had an unfavorable impact of approximately $160 million on our full year adjusted tax expense under Endo's non-GAAP policy prior to the adoption of the SEC's C&DI. The elimination of this acquired attribute benefit was offset by an improved mix of jurisdictional adjusted pretax income resulting primarily from the reorganization. This reorg also gave rise to a discrete net GAAP tax benefit of approximately $450 million in the second quarter from outside basis differences. This benefit has been excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with our policy. 
As I talked about earlier, as a result of the SEC's C&DI, Endo is no longer excluding the noncash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted effective tax rate. However, since we utilized almost all of our tax attributes through the legal entity reorganization,  the implementation of the updated C&DI guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our 2016 and forward-looking adjusted tax rate. Endo continues to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 0 to 2%, as guided in our first quarter 2016 earnings announcement. We expect to have a GAAP tax benefit and a negative cash tax rate for 2016. Importantly, for our outlook for 2017 and future years, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the high single digits to low double digits and our average cash tax rate to be below 5% over the next 5 years. 
Next, on Slide 15, you will see a snapshot of the second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Rajiv covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. 
On a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $1.75 in the quarter versus a loss of $0.49 in the second quarter of 2015. 2016 second quarter GAAP results were driven by an operating loss of $48 million, offset by the tax benefit that I discussed earlier. Tax benefit also offset the impact of a higher share count in 2016. 
Our GAAP operating loss was largely impacted by a decrease in gross margins due to a higher mix of generic revenue in the second quarter compared to 2015 and due to incremental amortization expense associated with the stepped-up value of intangible assets from Par. On an adjusted basis, overall Q2 results are slightly better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points Rajiv and Paul made, revenue was better than expected due to sterile injectables, stronger-than-expected performance from a number of branded products and a modest timing benefit related to quarter-end buying patterns. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues discussed earlier. 
On Slide 16, while the second quarter was ahead of our guided expectations, we are maintaining our guidance ranges, as some of the upside in the second quarter was driven by favorable timing. As Rajiv mentioned, we are also going to invest at a higher level than originally planned in our key growth drivers in the second half of the year through a reallocation of operating expenses and a modest step-up in spending. 
Regarding the cadence of revenues and adjusted earnings in the second half of the year, we continue to project the fourth quarter to be disproportionately larger than the rest of the year's quarters due to the launch of the generics Seroquel and Zetia. For third quarter 2016, we expect revenues in the range of $830 million to $870 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.82. This implies a sequential step-down in third quarter of 2016. The anticipated decline is driven by the product order timing benefits in the second quarter that we expect to reverse in the third quarter, lower U.S. branded sales related to generic competition for Voltaren Gel, continued slowing in the testosterone market, continued declines in legacy pain products and an increased investment in R&D as well as XIAFLEX and BELBUCA promotional efforts. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 17. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP cash flow from operations totaled approximately $555 million. We have also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our reported or GAAP cash flows for the year. 
On Slide 18, we are reiterating our view on cash available to pay down debt in 2016. We continue to project debt pay-down of approximately $250 million in 2016 and to exit the year at a mid- to high 4x net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $670 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $390 million in restricted cash and a net debt-to-leverage ratio of approximately 4.6x. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by our second quarter financial results and pleased to affirm our full year outlook while increasing investment in key growth drivers. 
Now to close out the call, let me turn it back over to Rajiv. Rajiv?"

Moving to Slide 20. In summary, there are a number of key growth drivers that position our U.S. Branded business for long-term growth. We believe strongly in the significant in-market growth opportunities for both XIAFLEX and BELBUCA. We are continuing to optimize our team and our business to achieve their growth potential while also managing our diversified portfolio of other products. We are also accelerating our R&D pipeline to advance those programs and the time lines for their potential market entry. We continue to execute on these growth drivers in the second quarter and expect to achieve additional key milestones through the end of this year and beyond. 
On Slide 21, let's recap the key achievements in our U.S. Generics business. We are focused on driving growth through our differentiated, higher barrier-to-entry products like sterile injectables and our robust pipeline of more than 250 programs for restructuring. We have a diversified reset base business and a robust, highly compliant manufacturing network. In 2016 and beyond, our success will be driven by Paul and his proven team as they continue to execute on these opportunities. 
Let's briefly summarize our call today on Slide 22. In Q2, we delivered solid top and adjusted bottom line results, beating our Q2 adjusted results guidance. We made substantial progress on our continued focus on operational execution and enhancing flexibility for our business. And we are affirming our full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance while increasing our investment in branded and generic R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX promotion. Endo is executing on our strategic priorities, and we continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for the company, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders.

Louise, let me address the first 2 questions, and I will have Paul address the third one. So in XIAFLEX, as we have commented in the past, the growth profile does tend to be a little bit lumpy and have some seasonal fluctuations to it. So as you might recall, we had a very robust growth in the first quarter. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in Dupuytren's contracture in the second quarter. But as we look out over the remainder of the year, we do feel confident in the double-digit growth trajectory that we have talked about. Now in terms of the revenue profile, as you know, customer stocking is largely out of our control, though, typically, XIAFLEX stocking in the specialty distributors and the specialty pharmacies, in general, is around 14 days, about 2 weeks. But from time to time, we do see some unusual changes to it, which is what happened in the second quarter. Our stocking is around 1 week, so approximately half of what it typically is. Now we have seen this behavior in the past, and typically, over the course of the year, it tends to normalize. But by and large, it is out of our control. So what we look to is demand while growth. And that's where when we look at the 19% growth in Peyronie's, we do feel very good about this indication, given that from a longer-term perspective, for our on-market indications, the biggest opportunity is in Peyronie's. In terms of divestments of non-core assets, I just wanted to be clear that from a company perspective, we don't feel compelled to divest any assets. We are confident in our business and the natural delevering nature of the business, given the -- our substantial cash flows, particularly as we look beyond the known mesh payments in '16 and '17. That being said, I think we've also been clear that as a company and as a board, we are always -- we are shareholder-friendly. And when there are any opportunities that come our way that are value-creating, we will certainly evaluate them on a -- our standard basis. Paul, maybe you can comment on the Qualitest business."

When you look at our base business play, we define that as the pain-control substances as well as the oral extended-release and immediate-release products. That also includes some of the Par portfolio. When you look at that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we communicated this at our last earnings call, that we were anticipating about 5% erosion quarter-over-quarter, and that's exactly where we landed. So it's in line with our expectations and how we communicated. So generally, our base business is falling in line, and we're not seeing the heavy erosion that we realized in Q1."

So in BELBUCA, the feedback continues to be similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, which is positive feedback from physicians, positive feedback into the patient experience. The 2 areas which are leading to slow uptake of the product beyond just the overall environment in opioid, one is the process of getting the physician community comfortable with the tapering and titrating requirements in terms of switching patients between different opioids and onto BELBUCA. And secondly, it's around the payer environment and how they see the Schedule III products. So on the latter, we made good progress. At this point, we have contracted roughly around 85% of commercial lives, and about 70% of that at -- without any restrictions beyond the label, we expect to continue to improve that over the course of the year. But, of course, at this point, in a launch of a product like this, we don't yet have government reimbursement. But what we see as being the real opportunity is the pharmacoeconomic and public health argument for why a Schedule III product like BELBUCA is preferable to other opioids such as the Schedule II products in terms of where it is introduced in the treatment algorithm. And a lot of the investment that we are now making is around improving our fact base in terms of making those market access arguments. Clearly, we still continue to have a large investment from a field force standpoint, and that continues. We're also increasing our investment around physician education, particularly around the treatment and titrating of the product. But really, the upside benefit and the longer-term growth of the product is really predicated on us being able to really anchor buprenorphine as an effective and safe alternative in the opioid space, both on a peer standpoint as well as from a physician standpoint."

That being said, we have -- we will not be making any particular prediction around '17 and beyond. But I would say that we are very optimistic when we look at the current results that we are seeing in Peyronie's disease, which we think is the great opportunity for the 2 -- of the 2 on-market indications. And there are 3 areas in which we have made promotion investments and we expect to step up for the remainder of the year as well as going into '17, and they will be the following. One is an area which we already talked about, which is that we continue to need to make the lives of patients who currently are prescribed the product easy. And then that's mostly around reimbursement support. And we've substantially increased the level of internal resourcing around that as well as targeted third parties to support that. The second is a longer-term opportunity around disease awareness building. And we have begun to do piloting and early investments, particularly in Peyronie's, through our online campaign, Ask About the Curve. And it's, of course, too early to fully realize the benefit from it or fully conclude what the benefits will look like. But the early signs of web click-throughs and patient interest in going onto our site to a physician selector, for example, there's been substantial uptick in that, right? Now, clearly, for a product like this, the cycle from the time you get a patient interested in the product or interest in going to physician, to the time that he would have a first injection could be 6 to 9 months, right, which is why we always pointed to the back half of this year '17 before we really begin to see the benefit from it. And the third thing I would say is -- and this is probably more so true for Dupuytren's contracture than Peyronie's, is the need to make a compelling argument around the pharmacoeconomic benefits of a intervention like XIAFLEX versus surgery. And that's more of an opportunity for us in Dupuytren's contracture, where the hand surgeons who treat the condition often see the surgical option as a -- as the first option. And we've, of course, had very good success with the product with these physicians. But getting to the next level is going to require making an even strong argument around why this is the best interest of patients."

Obviously, we got the Orange Book patent listed in June. I think it was June 28. The way we kind of look at this product right now simply is from 2 different views. There was always a possibility that there could be a file that was issued with the FDA pre-Orange Book patent listing, and that's something where maybe we feel a little bit better about. And typically, what happened is if an application was in at the FDA for several months prior to the Orange Book listing, what you would expect is for a generic competitor to file a Paragraph IV very quickly and then we would have been noticed. That didn't happen; from that standpoint. We feel a little bit better. If an application went on file a month or 2, pre-June 28 or shortly thereafter, that's where we're not going to have that visibility. But if we were to get a Paragraph IV, say, today, it would take about 60 to 90 days for an application to be accepted for filing. So we would probably look to be in a 30-month stay, ticking somewhere late fourth quarter. That's the way I would start looking at it. So from that standpoint, we had originally said that we felt good through 2017. We probably will be in a position to say that we feel a little bit good through 2018, but we'll have better visibility around fourth quarter. In terms of the generic pipeline, from a standpoint of where we feel real good about, I think we'd like to focus a little bit on the 505(b)(2) side. I think that's an area of strength of the company, right? So while we haven't disclosed specifics, we do have a series of 505(b)(2)s that are starting to come through to fruition. And frankly, maybe we can talk a little bit more in terms of products that we feel a little bit better about. We had previously talked about 2 505(b)(2)s that we did not shed a lot of light on. We feel little bit better about them now. They are 2 forms of potassium. One is a liquid, and one is a powder form. We have started to receive positive feedback from the FDA in terms of removing unapproved sources. That's going to come to an end, whereby these unapproved sources will have the remainder of 2016 or so to have product into the market. These types of products will show benefit to Par and Endo in 2017. So that's an area that we'd like to focus in on. Thank you."

So for BELBUCA in the first couple of quarters, we've been clear that we think we are using a pull-through method to recognize revenue. So it has been minimal revenue recognition in the first half of the year, so single-digit millions. And the -- we've also been clear that given our launch ramp expectations that we expect the contributions in 2016, in total, to be relatively modest. So we would look to 2017, really as the first year of revenue contributions for BELBUCA, and I would be clear about what those expectations are at the appropriate time. In terms of pricing, and I'll let Paul answer the specific question in retrospect, but I will point out the following, which is, from an overall perspective, the Endo business benefits from volume, not price. And in particular, generics business has predominantly more price pressure than upward price potential. And any prices -- any price increase that we might be able to take on the true generics part of it as -- is overwhelmed by the price erosion that we see on the base business. Now products like Vasostrict are a little different, in that they are sold on the basis of NDA, although they are sold within Par. But even in those cases, we take a responsible approach to price increases. And just because we have flexibility does not mean that we will take a price increase. In the case of Vasostrict, the Par has been very thoughtful about how to price the product as an NDA. And for a life-saving product, it is still in the low hundreds in terms -- sorry, about 125 or so, plus or minus, in terms of what a unit costs. And a substantial amount of investment has also gone into our Rochester, Michigan facility to support this product, and CapEx in excess of $100 million. And from a forward-looking standpoint, our philosophy on price increases will not change, which is that we will be responsible about how we think about it. But Paul, maybe you have a specific commentary on Vasostrict."

And to Rajiv's point, we had to make investments in raw materials, in components and specific equipment for this particular product. We had the CapEx that Rajiv is referring to. And in essence, 20% of our overall CapEx goes into the Rochester facility to keep it compliant. So it's a big commitment specifically on this injectable, that product that's a life-saving product. And then in terms of like general price increases and whatnot, I think, again, when you look at the total generics business, in essence, we are a volume-driven company, to Rajiv's point. When you want to look at it as a one-off on a product-specific, in the case of this one product, it's true that we have taken some price increases, but they had been responsible.

Ultimately, the restructuring or reorganization that we implemented ultimately steps up the fair value of many of the assets within our generics business. That is the tax basis of those assets, which provides ongoing and durable cash tax benefit, and also provides flexibility in our ability to move those assets throughout our legal entities without residual tax leakage, which is our policy. We don't talk to specific asset values, but directionally, the way to think about how we value them is on future value based on discounted cash flows of our outlook for each of the products. And that goes into all of our intangible testing as well as our goodwill testing, et cetera. It's same analysis that underpins the valuation and, ultimately, the step-up."

These are things that going to set us apart, because clearly, consortiums are getting bigger, and that is going to create some more pressure on all the generic manufacturers.

The other thing we pointed out with those 8,000 cases was that there was a potential fraudulent scheme that was running through some components of that, and our priority was driving that to the ground and figuring out whether in fact that there was fraud perpetrators. So we have a series of subpoenas that have been issued. We are able -- we are in litigation mode around those subpoenas.

And from quarter-to-quarter, we are able to benefit from the performance in those brands. So there are brands like LIDODERM, which, as a branded product, has now really been reduced to a small component, because the product is, as far as we are concerned, fully genericized with 3 generic competitors in the market, including our own authorized generic. But from a contracting standpoint, we still hold some proportion of the market on our branded product. But clearly subject to generic pressures. OPANA, we pointed to OPANA as one of the products that was impacted by the CDC guidelines and the general slowdown in the opioid market, and I think that trend is continuing along the lines that we expected. But we also have a series of smaller products that we don't talk much about, that are also doing quite well, that are promoted. SUPPRELIN L.A. has been a very sticky and very good performance for us for a long period of time. NASCOBAL, which is a product that came over with the Par transaction and is a branded product that's promoted by our field force, is also doing quite well, right?

And it's Suky, on your question around the third quarter sequential reduction, the first thing I would say is, generally as a default, we tend to prefer not to give quarterly guidance because there are a lot of things that can affect a quarter, specifically around timing that could be material to the quarter. But on a whole year basis, they're not meaningful. But having said that, given our reset in Q1 and given the launches that we've got in fourth quarter, we are providing quarterly guidance at least for this year. For the third quarter, the way to think about the step-down is, one, you talked about already, which is the stocking that we saw in the second quarter. Our assumption is that reverses in the third quarter. Also, what underpins our assumption of the step-down is continued erosion in retail as that continues to face competition from a generic standpoint. We would expect LIDODERM to step down modestly. Our testosterone products continue to decline quarter-over-quarter, particularly because of the market. And then, again, we also expect to see some modest decline in our pain products. All of those declines are partially offset by growth in XIAFLEX and BELBUCA as well as Par launches. But net-net, our assumptions lead us to a decline on revenue into the third quarter. From an investment standpoint, that's all coming in the backdrop as we increase our investments against generics R&D as well as branded R&D and BELBUCA and XIAFLEX, as Rajiv has talked about earlier. So those are the moving parts that lead us to the third quarter. Again, what we're doing is taking a very prudent approach of applying quarterly guidance, given the lumpiness of the year."

I hope that you've all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here's a brief agenda for today's call. Moving to Slide 3. As you know, the third quarter brought some changes and I believe, a sharpened focus on operational execution at Endo. Despite some headwinds for our Generics Base business, the overall diversity of our portfolio did enable us to deliver solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. 
I recently took on the role of CEO, and I am working to realize the potential for Endo moving forward. Our product-by-product assessment of the business and our portfolios is in progress, and we are working on the development of a strategic plan. Importantly, we are once again pleased to reaffirm our 2016 revenues and adjusted EPS guidance. 
On Slide 4. You will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the third quarter was stronger than our expectations, which underlies our segment revenue and margin guidance provided earlier this year. We delivered solid XIAFLEX demand, particularly in Peyronie's disease, and our revenue growth expectation for XIAFLEX continues to be in the low double digits for the year. The BELBUCA launch is progressing, and we are evaluating how to maximize the value of this differentiated product within a challenging opioid market. We did see outperformance by select U.S. Branded products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM and some products in our other branded portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's talk about our international pharmaceuticals. Our results were in line with the expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we drove solid performance across our base business, launched Nucynta and secured the Canadian rights for XIAFLEX. The additions of these products can provide longer-term growth as we continue to manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our adjusted operating margins. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our generics business. We continued to deliver overall segment performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow led by Vasostrict. In new launches and alternative dosages, we saw better-than-expected performance from alternative dosages, especially the LIDODERM authorized generic, and we have launched 15 products since the beginning of the year. We continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. 
Our base business declined approximately 20% sequentially from the second quarter 2016 driven by higher-than-expected consortium pricing pressures, a vast consortium structure and certain competitive generic entrants late in the quarter. Excluding stocking and onetime factors, this decline was approximately 15% from the second quarter 2016. We now expect full year base business decline to be in the low 30s percentage range. Given this deeper-than-expected erosion for our base business for the quarter and the year, our base business erosion rate in 2017 may be larger than our previous assumption of a return to historic part [ph] annual erosion rates of 10% to 12%. We will update our assumptions on 2017 base erosion as part of our full year 2017 guidance on our year-end earnings call. It is important to note that Par's strategy is focused not on this base segment but on prioritizing [ph] growing higher-quality, higher barrier-to-entry products and continuing to advance and replenish our differentiating R&D pipeline. 
Moving on to Slide 8. You will see a chart tracking our new product launches. We have updated to show the 15 products that we have successfully launched so far in 2016. We've had a number of smaller product launches shift into early 2017 and others that we have rationalized due to commercialization assessments and our ongoing portfolio of prioritization but still anticipate that we will launch approximately 20 new products this year, including our first-to-file exclusive products, generic SEROQUEL XR and generic Zetia. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about those 2 key fourth quarter launches. Importantly, we've now launched our generic SEROQUEL XR product. The initial launch has gone smoothly, and all manufacturing, launch activities and product shipments are on track. Our expected December 2016 launch of generic Zetia is also progressing on track. We have received final approval from the FDA and have an agreement in place with Merck through our partner, Glenmark. This product is manufactured through that partnership with Glenmark, and we have a product in our warehouse and we're ready to launch with marketing exclusivity. Together, we expect these 2 first-to-file launches to contribute in line with our previously communicated projections. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Blaise Coleman to discuss the financial performance of the company and the quarter and our projected outlook. Blaise?"
28071,405113130,1079275,"Endo International plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have",483,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have loss per share of $0.86 in the quarter versus a loss of $3.84 in the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2016 decreased to $191 million compared to a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $804 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during third quarter 2015. On an adjusted basis, overall third quarter results are better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points that Paul made, revenue was strong due to continued performance from XIAFLEX and better than expected due to outperformance by sterile injectables, alternative dosages and select other branded products. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues, better gross margin percentage due to product mix and lower operating expenses primarily due to timing. 
On Slide 12, we are again reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS full year guidance. We expect revenues to be approximately $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80. Given our overperformance in Q3 versus our expectations, we have increased confidence in our overall full year guidance range, which takes into account several moving parts, including the range of our launch forecast for our first-to-file generic versions of SEROQUEL XR and Zetia, projections around year-end timing of product sales and shipments and continued pricing pressure for our U.S. Generics Base business. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 13. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $443 million. We've also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and September year-to-date basis. 
On Slide 14, we are updating our view on estimated free cash flow in 2016. We now project debt paydown of approximately $330 million in 2016 and to exit the year in the high 4x range for our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. While we've provided some color in the past on potential free cash flow headwinds and tailwinds in 2017, given our dynamic sector environment and our ongoing strategic assessment, both of which could impact cash flows in 2017 versus previous expectations, we will wait to provide any details or updates for next year until we provide our full year 2017 financial guidance in late February. 
As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $562 million in unrestricted cash, approximately $276 million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 4.9x. 
Now let me turn it back over to Paul."

There are some strategic updates regarding the 2017 market environment that we believe are important to discuss. First, the U.S. Generics competitive landscape and pricing pressures continue to be challenging. Deeper-than-expected base erosion trends that we see and saw in the third quarter indicate stronger headwinds on the front as we exit the year. Steeper-than-anticipated consortium pricing pressures, both in and out of formal bid cycles that we expect to wait [ph] on our generics business moving forward, could impact our adjusted gross margin profile. And our 505(b)(2) expectation and longer-term 505(b)(2) strategy has been impacted by the competitive landscape, regulatory actions and the pricing environment. We will provide more detailed insights into the expected impacts of these trends on our 2017 financial outlook when we provide full year guidance in late February 2017.  I would like to note that deeper-than-expected erosion and demand for our products and/or changes to our resource allocation resulting from our strategic assessment could result in changes in the carrying values of assets across our segments. 
Next, XIAFLEX. We've identified XIAFLEX as a core U.S. Branded product and growth driver for Endo moving forward. We continue to put resources and efforts behind accelerating traction and growth in our Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease indications. We're also analyzing our R&D pipeline. Cellulite remains the primary focus there, and we look forward to reporting out on our Phase IIb data upon the completion of that trial. Other potential indications are currently undergoing a full commercial assessment and analysis so that we can best prioritize our R&D efforts and determine clinical trial time lines moving forward. 
The launch of BELBUCA is also progressing. We continue to believe that BELBUCA offers a compelling and differentiated product profile, and we want to ensure that we are best positioned moving forward. 
Finally, as the new CEO, I am spending a lot of time evaluating and working with our legal team to further develop and execute on our strategy with respect to the ongoing mesh litigation. 
On Slide 17, let's talk about my CEO assessment process. As I mentioned, we are pleased to reaffirm our revenue and adjusted EPS full year 2016 financial guidance. Overall, business performance continues to be broadly in line with our expectations. We are in the process of conducting a bottoms-up product-by-product assessment of all 3 of our business units. We expect that we'll be ready to communicate our evolved corporate strategy in the February 2017 time frame of our fourth quarter 2016 earnings announcement. As we've done in the past, we expect that we'll also communicate our full year 2017 financial guidance and expectations for our business at that time. 
In closing, Endo is sharpening its focus on operational execution, and I am excited to be leading the company. I want to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated employees whose hard work and commitment to the company make what we do possible. We continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now let me turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period. Keri?"

I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. In essence, it's all 3 of those. So the starting point is, really, frankly, we want to start the tone and set the tone of credibility and really taking a real prudent approach here. But when we look at what's happening, we did have anticipated -- especially higher-than-anticipated pressure from the consortiums, and we did, in essence, see a little more discounting for some of the more established generic competitors, so a little bit of that going on as well. When we see the 20% erosion factor that we talked about, in essence, if we exclude a couple of onetime events, we are more in the 15% erosion for the quarter. And specifically, when you look at the area in which we were -- effect [ph] that we had 2 products that were authorized generics, right? So these are products that you know that we -- that are revenue drivers. But in essence, they are large -- they're lower-margin contributors to the Par franchise. So metoprolol and budesonide were 2 products that -- we see additional competition from budesonide, and then we had a little heavier-than-expected competition at Red Oak from a competitor on the metoprolol  aging. And then structurally, we're seeing some changes at McKesson. As you know, they are moving away from their San Francisco operation, and you're going to start to see a shift in McKesson to their European operation now [ph] referred to Claris 1. So they're starting to kick in, and you'll see a change on a go-forward basis as they kind of unite with Walmart."

When you look at our growth rate sequentially for XIAFLEX at a total molecule level, we grew about 12%, and the majority of that was due to a stocking movement. At the end of Q2, we had about 6 days on hand. And at the end of Q3, we have about 8 days on hand. In terms of gross margin, we had favorable mix during the quarter, again a little bit stronger than the sterile injectables and some of the areas that Paul talked about. If you look at our full year guidance, we did change our assumption to be at the upper end of our gross margin range.

So this is a subpoena that we received over 2 years ago, and I think it's safe to say that we believe that we've cooperated with the DOJ and that there's -- in essence, there's no new information. And as it pertains specifically to Par, it was a focus around 2 products and one product of which we do not even sell. So from that standpoint, we're feeling reasonably confident in our position. At least that's what we believe. And to be specific, the issue deals with a product called doxycycline hyclate. It's a product we do not even sell. There may be some confusion at the DOJ, but we sell a product that was called doxycycline monohydrate. And then the second product is a product called digoxin. And in essence, what occurred there, Par came into an already established market with 2 generic competitors, plus the brand. We were the fourth entrant to an established market, and we never took our price -- there was never a price increase with respect to digoxin. So I think that's probably a statement of fact here by Par, and that's our position."

The reality is that it'll be likely a little more steeper than that and that we [ph] just want to be a little bit mindful and thoughtful on how we communicate this. But when you look at the Par portfolio, the base is really not our focus. When you look at the products in our pipeline, products that we're launching, we're looking at more differentiated products. So we are -- as you know, as we call the portfolio out in some of the historical Qualitest products, we're now really moving to more technically challenging products that should be able to withstand pushback on either the trade or competitors. So we're shifting away from a highly commoditized portfolio as we move forward. So I feel we're going to have more erosion to deal with because the portfolio is still quite large.

When you look at portfolios that are historically in either the injectable portfolio or even some of the legacy Par brands that have shifted over to Endo, those are pure 505(b)(2)s, and we have the resources and the R&D to continue to develop those products. But just to drill into specifically where I think you're headed is when Par undertakes a conversion of an unapproved drug to approved status, and those I break into 2 categories, operate those into a category whereby we will continue with our 505(b)(2) strategy of taking unapproved drugs and converting them, one into requisite clinical trials and putting a brand strategy behind that, where that may be detailed either through Joe's Endo team or Tony injectable team. That we will fight for intellectual property. That falls into one category. We have intellectual property, it should be normal course. The product will be priced appropriately for the work in which we've done to get approval for, and then hopefully, our intellectual property will stick and we have something that we can build upon. Where we're getting some challenges is in the third category where we developed a 505(b)(2) where we now have a brand we are working with the FDA to remove the unapproved sources yet we don't have intellectual property. So now we have a timing issue. That's an area that we just need to pause a little bit because the window is a shorter period of time for contribution. So now in today's environment, there are pricing pressures and we got to be a little bit mindful of that. So we will continue with the strategy, understanding that we can get intellectual property, that these 505(b)(2), in essence, will behave like a super generic, where we'll have the benefit and contribution driven by volume, but the pricing environment is going to be a little bit tighter and the likelihood is that you will see ANDAs coming in at a quicker rate, but that's fine. That's still a meaningful product for the Par portfolio and we will continue to do that, but that's where we will see a little pressure."

So I'm seeing a lot of quality compliance issues with our competitors. I'm seeing a lot of back order issues. I think this gives us an advantage. And also I think having a facility on U.S. soil with the R&D team and the manufacturing and quality teams that we have, I think that's an advantage for us. When I look at our product launches, we are always first-to-market in our categories in which we choose to play, and I think that provides a good set point for us as we move forward and, ultimately, execute on our GPO contract. So once we do that, we're holding the contract and it's ours to defend. I think that differentiates us. Regarding the question on biosimilars, I know we'll come back, I missed one, but the questions on biosimilars, maybe that is not a primary strategy of ours today. An area that we have focused in on it -- I'm not going to get too deep into it but, we are focusing on polypeptides. That is challenging chemistry.

So first of all, it is an important contributor for 2017, and I think the easier ones for you to understand is right now there's 2 forms. There's a liquid form and there's a powder form. The liquid form, you can easily go to IMS data and calculate the units there. We have, in essence, converted the entire market, maybe not entire market probably in the very high 90s. So what I'm politely saying is that we've executed in all the unapproved sources have been off the market for a couple of months. So that to me is a running nicely. But there's no barrier-to-entry, so you just have to be aware that a ANDA can be filed and that product has been approved since I believe around 2014. So you just got to make an assumption. At some point, a company that has liquid capabilities can enter the market. The powder is the one that probably has created the most question because there's so many different forms of powder. And I think in terms of sizing that and I think it's safe to say that it's probably easier for us to communicate the number of packets in the market and then you can go back and do the math. In essence, this is an $18 million pack market. They're broken into 30s and 100s. I would tell you that's probably irrelevant, but for your math, go back, you're using 80 [ph] million in packets and then you can look at standard single source type generic pricing relative to 505(b)(2). I want to make the assumption that is a single source, highly genericized type product. That's the way I would think that you should look at the powder. Now having said that, there are still pull-through of unapproved sources. So the unapproved sources were asked to exit the market back in the June time frame, and I believe that they had 2 months to produce product and 3 months to sell through product. So there's going to be a period of time where it's probably going to take us to Q1 before we see that conversion. So I think those are your levers in order to calculate the powder opportunity."

So I believe Actavis came in with maybe 5-week headstart based upon a settlement agreement. And then about maybe 9 or 10 companies followed on. So the reality is while it was a large product, there was an awful lot of competition, and we have a short burst, and at the end of the day, pricing fell to probably somewhere around 98.5% to 99% off the brand wagon. And again, that's not an area that we don't want to compete. That was a decision that was made many, many years ago and the market dynamics changed in that regard. On the [indiscernible] launch is behaving as we expected. So I feel pretty confident about that product on a go-forward basis. The product launch came out on November 1 and we've already taken on around 96%, 97% of the market in terms of signing on accounts. So it's behaving as we expected. In the case of Zetia, the reference that you're making in terms of brand retention, we've taken our -- what we believe is an appropriate approach to the fact that perhaps the brand could retain some percentage based upon maybe some PBM contracts. So that's been taken into consideration. I think what's maybe important is in this particular product, about 88% of the product is handed to the retail chains. I think that's an important factors so we feel pretty good about how this product's going to behave and we've taken in generic conversion in terms of what I think is appropriate.

I hope that you've all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here's a brief agenda for today's call. Moving to Slide 3. As you know, the third quarter brought some changes and I believe, a sharpened focus on operational execution at Endo. Despite some headwinds for our Generics Base business, the overall diversity of our portfolio did enable us to deliver solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. 
I recently took on the role of CEO, and I am working to realize the potential for Endo moving forward. Our product-by-product assessment of the business and our portfolios is in progress, and we are working on the development of a strategic plan. Importantly, we are once again pleased to reaffirm our 2016 revenues and adjusted EPS guidance. 
On Slide 4. You will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the third quarter was stronger than our expectations, which underlies our segment revenue and margin guidance provided earlier this year. We delivered solid XIAFLEX demand, particularly in Peyronie's disease, and our revenue growth expectation for XIAFLEX continues to be in the low double digits for the year. The BELBUCA launch is progressing, and we are evaluating how to maximize the value of this differentiated product within a challenging opioid market. We did see outperformance by select U.S. Branded products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM and some products in our other branded portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's talk about our international pharmaceuticals. Our results were in line with the expectations that underlie our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we drove solid performance across our base business, launched Nucynta and secured the Canadian rights for XIAFLEX. The additions of these products can provide longer-term growth as we continue to manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our adjusted operating margins. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our generics business. We continued to deliver overall segment performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow led by Vasostrict. In new launches and alternative dosages, we saw better-than-expected performance from alternative dosages, especially the LIDODERM authorized generic, and we have launched 15 products since the beginning of the year. We continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. 
Our base business declined approximately 20% sequentially from the second quarter 2016 driven by higher-than-expected consortium pricing pressures, a vast consortium structure and certain competitive generic entrants late in the quarter. Excluding stocking and onetime factors, this decline was approximately 15% from the second quarter 2016. We now expect full year base business decline to be in the low 30s percentage range. Given this deeper-than-expected erosion for our base business for the quarter and the year, our base business erosion rate in 2017 may be larger than our previous assumption of a return to historic Par annual erosion rates of 10% to 12%. We will update our assumptions on 2017 base erosion as part of our full year 2017 guidance on our year-end earnings call. It is important to note that Par's strategy is focused not on this base segment but on prioritizing growing higher-quality, higher barrier-to-entry products and continuing to advance and replenish our differentiating R&D pipeline. 
Moving on to Slide 8. You will see a chart tracking our new product launches. We have updated to show the 15 products that we have successfully launched so far in 2016. We've had a number of smaller product launches shift into early 2017 and others that we have rationalized due to commercialization assessments and our ongoing portfolio of prioritization but still anticipate that we will launch approximately 20 new products this year, including our first-to-file exclusive products, generic SEROQUEL XR and generic Zetia. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about those 2 key fourth quarter launches. Importantly, we've now launched our generic SEROQUEL XR product. The initial launch has gone smoothly, and all manufacturing, launch activities and product shipments are on track. Our expected December 2016 launch of generic Zetia is also progressing on track. We have received final approval from the FDA and have an agreement in place with Merck through our partner, Glenmark. This product is manufactured through that partnership with Glenmark, and we have a product in our warehouse and we're ready to launch with marketing exclusivity. Together, we expect these 2 first-to-file launches to contribute in line with our previously communicated projections. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Blaise Coleman to discuss the financial performance of the company and the quarter and our projected outlook. Blaise?"

First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have",483,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have loss per share of $0.86 in the quarter versus a loss of $3.84 in the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2016 decreased to $191 million compared to a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $804 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during third quarter 2015. On an adjusted basis, overall third quarter results are better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points that Paul made, revenue was strong due to continued performance from XIAFLEX and better than expected due to outperformance by sterile injectables, alternative dosages and select other branded products. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues, better gross margin percentage due to product mix and lower operating expenses primarily due to timing. 
On Slide 12, we are again reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS full year guidance. We expect revenues to be approximately $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80. Given our overperformance in Q3 versus our expectations, we have increased confidence in our overall full year guidance range, which takes into account several moving parts, including the range of our launch forecast for our first-to-file generic versions of SEROQUEL XR and Zetia, projections around year-end timing of product sales and shipments and continued pricing pressure for our U.S. Generics Base business. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 13. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $443 million. We've also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and September year-to-date basis. 
On Slide 14, we are updating our view on estimated free cash flow in 2016. We now project debt paydown of approximately $330 million in 2016 and to exit the year in the high 4x range for our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. While we've provided some color in the past on potential free cash flow headwinds and tailwinds in 2017, given our dynamic sector environment and our ongoing strategic assessment, both of which could impact cash flows in 2017 versus previous expectations, we will wait to provide any details or updates for next year until we provide our full year 2017 financial guidance in late February. 
As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $562 million in unrestricted cash, approximately $276 million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 4.9x. 
Now let me turn it back over to Paul."

There are some strategic updates regarding the 2017 market environment that we believe are important to discuss. First, the U.S. Generics competitive landscape and pricing pressures continue to be challenging. Deeper-than-expected base erosion trends that we see and saw in the third quarter indicate stronger headwinds on the front as we exit the year. Steeper-than-anticipated consortium pricing pressures, both in and out of formal bid cycles that we expect to weight on our generics business moving forward, could impact our adjusted gross margin profile. And our 505(b)(2) expectation and longer-term 505(b)(2) strategy has been impacted by the competitive landscape, regulatory actions and the pricing environment. We will provide more detailed insights into the expected impacts of these trends on our 2017 financial outlook when we provide full year guidance in late February 2017. I would like to note that deeper-than-expected erosion and demand for our products and/or changes to our resource allocation resulting from our strategic assessment could result in changes in the carrying values of assets across our segments. 
Next, XIAFLEX. We've identified XIAFLEX as a core U.S. Branded product and growth driver for Endo moving forward. We continue to put resources and efforts behind accelerating traction and growth in our Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease indications. We're also analyzing our R&D pipeline. Cellulite remains the primary focus there, and we look forward to reporting out on our Phase IIb data upon the completion of that trial. Other potential indications are currently undergoing a full commercial assessment and analysis so that we can best prioritize our R&D efforts and determine clinical trial time lines moving forward. 
The launch of BELBUCA is also progressing. We continue to believe that BELBUCA offers a compelling and differentiated product profile, and we want to ensure that we are best positioned moving forward. 
Finally, as the new CEO, I am spending a lot of time evaluating and working with our legal team to further develop and execute on our strategy with respect to the ongoing mesh litigation. 
On Slide 17, let's talk about my CEO assessment process. As I mentioned, we are pleased to reaffirm our revenue and adjusted EPS full year 2016 financial guidance. Overall, business performance continues to be broadly in line with our expectations. We are in the process of conducting a bottoms-up product-by-product assessment of all 3 of our business units. We expect that we'll be ready to communicate our evolved corporate strategy in the February 2017 time frame of our fourth quarter 2016 earnings announcement. As we've done in the past, we expect that we'll also communicate our full year 2017 financial guidance and expectations for our business at that time. 
In closing, Endo is sharpening its focus on operational execution, and I am excited to be leading the company. I want to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated employees whose hard work and commitment to the company make what we do possible. We continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now let me turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period. Keri?"

Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color, go into a little bit more detail in terms of the evolving consortium pricing pressures that you've referenced several times in the release and during your prepared commentary? Just trying to figure out, is this a result of a renewed bid cycle or some structural change on the consortiums with some of the recent movement? Or is it simply just existing competitors be a lot more aggressive and current product markets or the impact of new competition or maybe all 3? But if you could just maybe give a little bit more clarity behind that, it would be helpful."

I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. In essence, it's all 3 of those. So the starting point is, really, frankly, we want to start the tone and set the tone of credibility and really taking a real prudent approach here. But when we look at what's happening, we did have anticipated -- especially higher-than-anticipated pressure from the consortiums, and we did, in essence, see a little more discounting for some of the more established generic competitors, so a little bit of that going on as well. When we see the 20% erosion factor that we talked about, in essence, if we exclude a couple of onetime events, we are more in the 15% erosion for the quarter. And specifically, when you look at the area in which we were -- effect that we had 2 products that were authorized generics, right? So these are products that you know that we -- that are revenue drivers. But in essence, they are large -- they're lower-margin contributors to the Par franchise. So metoprolol and budesonide were 2 products that -- we see additional competition from budesonide, and then we had a little heavier-than-expected competition at Red Oak from a competitor on the metoprolol aging. And then structurally, we're seeing some changes at McKesson. As you know, they are moving away from their San Francisco operation, and you're going to start to see a shift in McKesson to their European operation now referred to Claris 1. So they're starting to kick in, and you'll see a change on a go-forward basis as they kind of unite with Walmart."

At the end of Q2, we had about 6 days on hand. And at the end of Q3, we have about 8 days on hand. In terms of gross margin, we had favorable mix during the quarter, again a little bit stronger than the sterile injectables and some of the areas that Paul talked about.

So we're not going to be able to comment a little bit specifically on the DOJ process, and maybe what we can do is maybe just talk to the facts here. So this is a subpoena that we received over 2 years ago, and I think it's safe to say that we believe that we've cooperated with the DOJ and that there's -- in essence, there's no new information. And as it pertains specifically to Par, it was a focus around 2 products and one product of which we do not even sell. So from that standpoint, we're feeling reasonably confident in our position. At least that's what we believe. And to be specific, the issue deals with a product called doxycycline hyclate. It's a product we do not even sell. There may be some confusion at the DOJ, but we sell a product that was called doxycycline monohydrate. And then the second product is a product called digoxin. And in essence, what occurred there, Par came into an already established market with 2 generic competitors, plus the brand. We were the fourth entrant to an established market, and we never took our price -- there was never a price increase with respect to digoxin. So I think that's probably a statement of fact here by Par, and that's our position."

And we just want to be a little bit mindful and thoughtful on how we communicate this. But when you look at the Par portfolio, the base is really not our focus. When you look at the products in our pipeline, products that we're launching, we're looking at more differentiated products. So we are -- as you know, as we call the portfolio out in some of the historical Qualitest products, we're now really moving to more technically challenging products that should be able to withstand pushback on either the trade or competitors. So we're shifting away from a highly commoditized portfolio as we move forward. So I feel we're going to have more erosion to deal with because the portfolio is still quite large. But over time, as we launch more products, we should be in a better position to keep our margins at the historical 50 -- low-50 percentage on a go-forward basis."

So Marc, when I look at 505(b)(2)s, I like to break them into 3 categories, right? And we got to be real specific here. So 505(b)(2)s has been and will continue to be a part of the Endo-Par strategy, but I break them into 2 categories. When you look at portfolios that are historically in either the injectable portfolio or even some of the legacy Par brands that have shifted over to Endo, those are pure 505(b)(2)s, and we have the resources and the R&D to continue to develop those products. But just to drill into specifically where I think you're headed is when Par undertakes a conversion of an unapproved drug to approved status, and those I break into 2 categories, operate those into a category whereby we will continue with our 505(b)(2) strategy of taking unapproved drugs and converting them, running the requisite clinical trials and putting a brand strategy behind that, where that may be detailed either through Joe's Endo team or Tony Pera's injectable team. That we will fight for intellectual property. That falls into one category. When we have intellectual property, it should be normal course. We'll launch the product. It will be priced appropriately for the work in which we've done to gain approval for. And then hopefully, our intellectual property will stick and we have something that we can build upon. Where we're getting some challenges is in the third category, where we develop a 505(b)(2) where we now have a brand we are working with the FDA to remove the unapproved sources, yet we don't have intellectual property. So now we have a timing issue. That's an area that we just need to pause a little bit because the window is a shorter period of time for contribution. So now in today's environment, there are pricing pressures, and we've got to be a little bit mindful of that. So we will continue with the strategy, understanding that when we can get intellectual property, that these 505(b)(2)s, in essence, will behave like a super generic, where we'll have the benefit and contribution driven by volume, but the pricing environment is going to be a little bit tighter and the likelihood is that we will see ANDAs coming in at a quicker rate. But that's fine. That's still a meaningful product for the Par portfolio, and we will continue to do that. But that's where we will see a little pressure."

We're not going to disclose specifically our products because we don't want to place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. What I will call out is we don't have the 2 blockbusters that you're seeing right now in Zetia and quetiapine. That we don't have, but you need to remember that we are getting the benefit and the carryover of those 2 products from the fourth quarter of 2016 into the first quarter. So that's going to help us project into 2017. We've got a solid pipeline, but they are smaller products. Some of them contain Paragraph IVs. Some are first-to-market opportunities. At this point in time, we're not going to disclose them because we're not going to place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. We're going to continue with our 505(b)(2) strategy. We're doing very nicely with our potassium liquid product. We're starting to build momentum with our potassium powder product. Vasostrict continues to perform. The injectable portfolio continuous to perform.

So that, to us, is an area that we have the skill set with our teams in place, and it's something that we're starting to do well. That, coupled with our Paragraph IV strategy, I think places us in a position to deliver higher-value generics on a go-forward basis."

And I think the easier ones for you to understand is right now, there's 2 forms. There's a liquid form, and there's a powder form. The liquid form, you can easily go to IMS data and calculate the units there. We have, in essence, converted the entire market. Maybe you might say the entire market is probably in the very high 90s. So what I'm politely saying is that we've executed, and all the unapproved sources have been off the market for a couple of months. So that, to me, is running nicely. But there's no barrier to entry, so you just have to be aware that an ANDA can be filed. And that product has been approved since, I believe, around 2014. So you just got to make an assumption. At some point, a company that has liquid capabilities can enter the market. The powder is the one that probably has created the most questions because there's so many different forms of powder. And I think in terms of sizing that -- and I think it's safe to say that we -- it's probably easier for us to communicate the number of packets in the market, and then you can go back and do the math. In essence, this is an 18 million pack market, right? And they're broken into 30s and 100s. I would tell you that's probably irrelevant. But for your math, go back, you're using 18 million packets, and then you can look at standard single-source-type generic pricing relative to 505(b)(2). I would make the assumption that it's a single-sourced, highly genericized-type product. That's the way I would think that you should look at the powder. Now having said that, there are still pull-through of unapproved sources. So the unapproved sources were asked to exit the market back in the June time frame, and I believe that they had 2 months to produce product and 3 months to sell through product. So there's going to be a period of time where it's probably going to take us to Q1 before we see that conversion. So I think those are your levers in order to calculate the powder opportunity."

I mean, I think there was about 11 approvals on, I would say, that second tranche. So I believe Actavis came in with maybe 5-week head start based upon a settlement agreement, and then about maybe 9 or 10 companies followed on. So the reality is that while it was a large product, it was -- there was an awful lot of competition. And we had a short burst, and at the end of the day, pricing fell to probably somewhere around 98.5% to 99% off of brand wagon. And again, that's an area that we don't want to compete. That was a decision that was made many, many years ago when the market dynamics changed in that regard. On quetiapine, quetiapine launch is behaving as we expected, so I feel pretty confident about that product on a go-forward basis. The product launch came out on November 1, and we've already taken on around 96%, 97% of the market in terms of signing on accounts. So it's behaving as we expected. In the case of Zetia, the reference that you're making in terms of brand retention, we've taken our -- what we believe is an appropriate approach to the fact that perhaps the brand could retain some percentage based upon maybe some PBM contracts. So that's been taken into consideration. I think what may be important is in this particular product, about 88% of the product is handled through the retail chains. I think that's an important factor. So we feel pretty good about how this product's going to behave, and we've taken in generic conversion in terms of what I think is appropriate. So I feel good about where Zetia will head. No guarantees, but I feel good."

I hope that you've all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here's a brief agenda for today's call. Moving to Slide 3. As you know, the third quarter brought some changes and I believe, a sharpened focus on operational execution at Endo. Despite some headwinds for our Generics Base business, the overall diversity of our portfolio did enable us to deliver solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. 
I recently took on the role of CEO, and I am working to realize the potential for Endo moving forward. Our product-by-product assessment of the business and our portfolios is in progress, and we are working on the development of a strategic plan. Importantly, we are once again pleased to reaffirm our 2016 revenues and adjusted EPS guidance. 
On Slide 4. You will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the third quarter was stronger than our expectations, which underlies our segment revenue and margin guidance provided earlier this year. We delivered solid XIAFLEX demand, particularly in Peyronie's disease, and our revenue growth expectation for XIAFLEX continues to be in the low double digits for the year. The BELBUCA launch is progressing, and we are evaluating how to maximize the value of this differentiated product within a challenging opioid market. We did see outperformance by select U.S. Branded products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM and some products in our other branded portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's talk about our international pharmaceuticals. Our results were in line with the expectations that underlied our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we drove solid performance across our base business, launched Nucynta and secured the Canadian rights for XIAFLEX. The additions of these products could provide a longer-term growth as we continue to manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our adjusted operating margins. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our generics business. We continued to deliver overall segment performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow led by Vasostrict. In new launches and alternative dosages, we saw better-than-expected performance from alternative dosages, especially the LIDODERM authorized generic, and we have launched 15 products since the beginning of the year. We continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. 
Our base business declined approximately 20% sequentially from the second quarter 2016 driven by higher-than-expected consortium pricing pressures, a vast [ph] consortium structure and certain competitive generic entrants late in the quarter. Excluding stocking and onetime factors, this decline was approximately 15% from the second quarter 2016. We now expect full year base business decline to be in the low 30s percentage range. Given this deeper-than-expected erosion for our base business for the quarter and the year, our base business erosion rate in 2017 may be larger than our previous assumption of a return to historic Par annual erosion rates of 10% to 12%. We will update our assumptions on 2017 base erosion as part of our full year 2017 guidance on our year-end earnings call. It is important to note that Par's strategy is focused not on this base segment but on prioritizing growing higher-quality, higher barrier-to-entry products and continuing to advance and replenish our differentiating R&D pipeline. 
Moving on to Slide 8. You will see a chart tracking our new product launches. We have updated to show the 15 products that we have successfully launched so far in 2016. We've had a number of smaller product launches shift into early 2017 and others that we have rationalized due to commercialization assessments and our ongoing portfolio of prioritization but still anticipate that we will launch approximately 20 new products this year, including our first-to-file exclusive products, generic SEROQUEL XR and generic Zetia. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about those 2 key fourth quarter launches. Importantly, we've now launched our generic SEROQUEL XR product. The initial launch has gone smoothly, and all manufacturing, launch activities and product shipments are on track. Our expected December 2016 launch of generic Zetia is also progressing on track. We have received final approval from the FDA and have an agreement in place with Merck through our partner, Glenmark. This product is manufactured through that partnership with Glenmark, and we have a product in our warehouse and we're ready to launch with marketing exclusivity. Together, we expect these 2 first-to-file launches to contribute in line with our previously communicated projections. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Blaise Coleman to discuss the financial performance of the company and the quarter and our projected outlook. Blaise?"
28071,405113130,1080012,"Endo International plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have",483,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have loss per share of $0.86 in the quarter versus a loss of $3.84 in the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2016 decreased to $191 million compared to a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $804 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during third quarter 2015. On an adjusted basis, overall third quarter results are better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points that Paul made, revenue was strong due to continued performance from XIAFLEX and better than expected due to outperformance by sterile injectables, alternative dosages and select other branded products. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues, better gross margin percentage due to product mix and lower operating expenses primarily due to timing. 
On Slide 12, we are again reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS full year guidance. We expect revenues to be approximately $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80. Given our overperformance in Q3 versus our expectations, we have increased confidence in our overall full year guidance range, which takes into account several moving parts, including the range of our launch forecast for our first-to-file generic versions of SEROQUEL XR and Zetia, projections around year-end timing of product sales and shipments and continued pricing pressure for our U.S. Generics Base business. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 13. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $443 million. We've also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and September year-to-date basis. 
On Slide 14, we are updating our view on estimated free cash flow in 2016. We now project debt paydown of approximately $330 million in 2016 and to exit the year in the high 4x range for our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. While we've provided some color in the past on potential free cash flow headwinds and tailwinds in 2017, given our dynamic sector environment and our ongoing strategic assessment, both of which could impact cash flows in 2017 versus previous expectations, we will wait to provide any details or updates for next year until we provide our full year 2017 financial guidance in late February. 
As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $562 million in unrestricted cash, approximately $276 million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 4.9x. 
Now let me turn it back over to Paul."

There are some strategic updates regarding the 2017 market environment that we believe are important to discuss. First, the U.S. Generics competitive landscape and pricing pressures continue to be challenging. Deeper-than-expected base erosion trends that we see and saw in the third quarter indicate stronger headwinds on the front as we exit the year. Steeper-than-anticipated consortium pricing pressures, both in and out of formal bid cycles that we expect to weigh on our generics business moving forward, could impact our adjusted gross margin profile. And our 505(b)(2) expectation and longer-term 505(b)(2) strategy has been impacted by the competitive landscape, regulatory actions and the pricing environment. We will provide more detail and insights into the expected impacts of these trends on our 2017 financial outlook when we provide full year guidance in late February 2017. I would like to note that deeper-than-expected erosion and demand for our products and/or changes to our resource allocation resulting from our strategic assessment could result in changes in the carrying values of assets across our segments. 
Next, XIAFLEX. We've identified XIAFLEX as a core U.S. Branded product and growth driver for Endo moving forward. We continue to put resources and efforts behind accelerating traction and growth in our Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease indications. We're also analyzing our R&D pipeline. Cellulite remains the primary focus there, and we look forward to reporting out on our Phase IIb data upon the completion of that trial. Other potential indications are currently undergoing a full commercial assessment and analysis so that we can best prioritize our R&D efforts and determine clinical trial time lines moving forward. 
The launch of BELBUCA is also progressing. We continue to believe that BELBUCA offers a compelling and differentiated product profile, and we want to ensure that we are best positioned moving forward. 
Finally, as the new CEO, I am spending a lot of time evaluating and working with our legal team to further develop and execute on our strategy with respect to the ongoing mesh litigation. 
On Slide 17, let's talk about my CEO assessment process. As I mentioned, we are pleased to reaffirm our revenue and adjusted EPS full year 2016 financial guidance. Overall, business performance continues to be broadly in line with our expectations. We are in the process of conducting a bottoms-up product-by-product assessment of all 3 of our business units. We expect that we'll be ready to communicate our evolved corporate strategy in the February 2017 time frame of our fourth quarter 2016 earnings announcement. As we've done in the past, we expect that we'll also communicate our full year 2017 financial guidance and expectations for our business at that time. 
In closing, Endo is sharpening its focus on operational execution, and I am excited to be leading the company. I want to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated employees whose hard work and commitment to the company make what we do possible. We continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now let me turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period. Keri?"

Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color, go into a little bit more detail in terms of the evolving consortium pricing pressures that you've referenced several times in the release and during your prepared commentary? Just trying to figure out, is this a result of a renewed bid cycle or some structural change on the consortiums with some of the recent movement? Or is it simply just existing competitors be a lot more aggressive in current product markets or the impact of new competition or maybe all 3?

I think you've kind of hit the nail on the head. In essence, it's all 3 of those. So the starting point is, really, frankly, we want to start the tone and set the tone of credibility and really taking a real prudent approach here. But when we look at what's happening, we did have anticipated -- essentially higher-than-anticipated pressure from the consortiums, and we did, in essence, see a little more discounting for some of the more established generic competitors, so a little bit of that going on as well. When we see the 20% erosion factor that we talked about, in essence, if we exclude a couple of onetime events, we are more in the 15% erosion for the quarter. And specifically, when you look at the area in which we were -- effect that we had 2 products that were authorized generics, right? So these are products that you know that we -- that are revenue drivers. But in essence, they are large -- they're lower-margin contributors to the Par franchise. So metoprolol and budesonide were 2 products that -- we received additional competition from budesonide, and then we had a little heavier-than-expected competition at Red Oak from a competitor on the metoprolol aging. And structurally, we're seeing some changes at McKesson. As you know, they are moving away from their San Francisco operation, and you're going to start to see a shift in McKesson to their European operation that referred to Claris 1. So they're starting to kick in, and you'll see a change on a go-forward basis as they kind of unite with Walmart."

At the end of Q2, we had about 6 days on hand. And at the end of Q3, we have about 8 days on hand. In terms of gross margin, we had favorable mix during the quarter, again a little bit stronger than the sterile injectables in some of the areas that Paul talked about. If you look at our full year guidance, we did change our assumption to be at the upper end of our gross margin range. So we would expect to see events that we've seen on a year-to-date basis playing through on a full year basis."

So we're not going to be able to comment a little bit specifically on the DOJ process, and maybe what we can do is maybe just talk to the facts here. So this is a subpoena that we received over 2 years ago, and I think it's safe to say that we believe that we've cooperated with the DOJ and that there's -- in essence, there's no new information. And as it pertains specifically to Par, it was a focus around 2 products and one product of which we do not even sell. So from that standpoint, we're feeling reasonably confident in our position. At least that's what we believe. And to be specific, the issue deals with a product called doxycycline hyclate. It's a product we do not even sell. There may be some confusion at the DOJ, but we sell a product that was called doxycycline monohydrate. And then the second product is a product called digoxin. And in essence, what occurred there, Par came into an already established market with 2 generic competitors, plus the brand. We were the fourth entrant to an established market, and we never took our price -- there was never a price increase with respect to digoxin. So I think that's probably a statement of fact here by Par, and that's our position."

So Randall, I think right now, we're going to come back in our February earnings call and provide a little bit more insight.

And we just want to be a little bit mindful and thoughtful on how we communicate this. But when you look at the Par portfolio, the base is really not our focus. When you look at the products in our pipeline, products that we're launching, we're looking at more differentiated products. So we are -- as you know, as we call the portfolio out in some of the historical Qualitest products, we're now really moving to more technically challenging products that should be able to withstand pushback on either the trade or competitors. So we're shifting away from a highly commoditized portfolio as we move forward. So I feel we're going to have more erosion to deal with because the portfolio is still quite large. But over time, as we launch some more products, we should be in a better position to keep our margins at the historical 50 -- low-50 percentage on a go-forward basis."

So 505(b)(2)s has been and will continue to be a part of the Endo-Par strategy, but I break them into 2 categories. When you look at portfolios that are historically in either the injectable portfolio or even some of the legacy Par brands that have shifted over to Endo, those are pure 505(b)(2)s, and we have the resources and the R&D to continue to develop those products. But just to drill into specifically where I think you're headed is when Par undertakes a conversion of an unapproved drug to approved status, and those I break into 2 categories. I'll break those into a category whereby we will continue with our 505(b)(2) strategy of taking unapproved drugs and converting them, running the requisite clinical trials and putting a brand strategy behind that, where that may be detailed either through Joe's Endo team or Tony Pera's injectable team. That we will fight for intellectual property. That falls into one category. When we have intellectual property, it should be normal course. We'll launch the product. It will be priced appropriately for the work in which we've done to gain approval for. And then hopefully, our intellectual property will stick and we have something that we can build upon. Where we're getting some challenges is in the third category, where we develop a 505(b)(2) where we now have a brand we are working with the FDA to remove the unapproved sources, yet we don't have intellectual property. So now we have a timing issue. That's an area that we just need to pause a little bit because the window is a shorter period of time for contribution. So now in today's environment, there are pricing pressures, and we've got to be a little bit mindful of that. So we will continue with the strategy, understanding that when we can get intellectual property, that these 505(b)(2)s, in essence, will behave like a super generic, where we'll have the benefit and contribution driven by volume, but the pricing environment is going to be a little bit tighter and the likelihood is that we will see ANDAs coming at a quicker rate. But that's fine. That's still a meaningful product for the Par portfolio, and we will continue to do that. But that's where we will see a little pressure."

But Sumant, I think one of our advantages, and I said this repeatedly, I think it is a good time for Endo to have sterile injectables facilities on U.S. soil. I think that separates us from the competition. So I'm seeing a lot of quality compliance issues with our competitors. I'm seeing a lot of back order issues. I think this gives us an advantage. And also, I think having a facility on U.S. soil with the R&D team and the manufacturing and quality teams that we have, I think that's an advantage for us. When I look at our product launches, we are always first-to-market in our categories in which we choose to play, and I think that provides a good set point for us as we move forward and ultimately, execute on our GPO contract. So once we do that, we're holding the contract and it's ours to defend. I think that differentiates us. Regarding the question on biosimilars, I know -- we'll come back, I've missed one. But the questions on the biosimilars, while maybe that's not a primary strategy of Par's today, an area that we have focused in on -- and I'm not going to get too deep into it, but we are focusing on polypeptides.

So first of all, it is an important contributor for 2017. And I think the easier ones for you to understand is right now, there's 2 forms. There's a liquid form, and there's a powder form.

And I think the easier ones for you to understand is right now, there's 2 forms. There's a liquid form, and there's a powder form. The liquid form, you can easily go to IMS data and calculate the units there. We have, in essence, converted the entire market. Maybe you might say the entire market is probably in the very high 90s. So what I'm politely saying is that we've executed, and all the unapproved sources have been off the market for a couple of months. So that, to me, is running nicely. But there's no barrier to entry, so you just have to be aware that an ANDA can be filed. And that product has been approved since, I believe, around 2014. So you just got to make an assumption. At some point, a company that has liquid capabilities can enter the market. The powder is the one that probably has created the most questions because there's so many different forms of powder. And I think in terms of sizing that -- and I think it's safe to say that we -- it's probably easier for us to communicate the number of packets in the market, and then you can go back and do the math. In essence, this is an 18-million-pack market, right? And they're broken into 30s and 100s. I would tell you that's probably irrelevant. But for your math, go back, you're using 18 million packets, and then you can look at standard single-source-type generic pricing. While it's a 505(b)(2), I would make the assumption that it's a single-sourced, highly genericized-type product. That's the way I would think that you should look at the powder. Now having said that, there are still pull-through of unapproved sources. So the unapproved sources were asked to exit the market back in the June time frame, and I believe that they had 2 months to produce product and 3 months to sell through product. So there's going to be a period of time where it's probably going to take us to Q1 before we see that conversion. So I think those are your levers in order to calculate the powder opportunity."

I mean, I think there was about 11 approvals on, I would say, that second tranche. So I believe Actavis came in with maybe 5-week head start based upon a settlement agreement, and then about maybe 9 or 10 companies followed on. So the reality is that while it was a large product, it was -- there was an awful lot of competition. And we had a short burst, and at the end of the day, pricing fell to probably somewhere around 98.5% to 99% off of brand wagon. And again, that's an area that we don't want to compete. That was a decision that was made many, many years ago and the market dynamics changed in that regard. On quetiapine, quetiapine launch is behaving as we expected, so I feel pretty confident about that product on a go-forward basis. The product launch came out on November 1, and we've already taken on around 96%, 97% of the market in terms of signing on accounts. So it's behaving as we expected. In the case of Zetia, the reference that you're making in terms of brand retention, we've taken our -- what we believe is an appropriate approach to the fact that perhaps the brand could retain some percentage based upon maybe some PBM contracts. So that's been taken into consideration. I think what may be important is in this particular product, about 88% of the product is handled through the retail chains. I think that's an important factor. So we feel pretty good about how this product's going to behave, and we've taken in generic conversion in terms of what I think is appropriate. So I feel good about where Zetia will head. No guarantees, but I feel good."

I hope that you've all had a chance to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier today. 
Let me now turn to our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. To start, here's a brief agenda for today's call. Moving to Slide 3. As you know, the third quarter brought some changes and I believe, a sharpened focus on operational execution at Endo. Despite some headwinds for our Generics Base business, the overall diversity of our portfolio did enable us to deliver solid revenue and adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter with revenue performance across all business units broadly in line or ahead of company expectations. 
I recently took on the role of CEO, and I am working to realize the potential for Endo moving forward. Our product-by-product assessment of the business and our portfolios is in progress, and we are working on the development of a strategic plan. Importantly, we are once again pleased to reaffirm our 2016 revenues and adjusted EPS guidance. 
On Slide 4. You will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 5. Let's discuss our branded business. Our branded performance in the third quarter was stronger than our expectations, which underlies our segment revenue and margin guidance provided earlier this year. We delivered solid XIAFLEX demand, particularly in Peyronie's disease, and our revenue growth expectation for XIAFLEX continues to be in the low double digits for the year. The BELBUCA launch is progressing, and we are evaluating how to maximize the value of this differentiated product within a challenging opioid market. We did see outperformance by select U.S. Branded products, including Voltaren Gel, LIDODERM and some products in our other branded portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's talk about our international pharmaceuticals. Our results were in line with the expectations that underlied our revenue and margin guidance provided in May for Paladin, Litha and Somar. At Paladin, we drove solid performance across our base business, launched Nucynta and secured the Canadian rights for XIAFLEX. The additions of these products could provide a longer-term growth as we continue to manage the expected loss of exclusivity on select products in the Canadian market this year. In our Litha and Somar businesses, our underlying revenue growth is outpacing market growth rates, largely driven by volume, and we continue to improve our adjusted operating margins. 
Turning to Slide 7 and our generics business. We continued to deliver overall segment performance in line with our expectations. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow led by Vasostrict. In new launches and alternative dosages, we saw better-than-expected performance from alternative dosages, especially the LIDODERM authorized generic, and we have launched 15 products since the beginning of the year. We continue to file new ANDAs with the FDA while replenishing our R&D pipeline. 
Our base business declined approximately 20% sequentially from the second quarter 2016 driven by higher-than-expected consortium pricing pressures, a vast [ph] consortium structure and certain competitive generic entrants late in the quarter. Excluding stocking and onetime factors, this decline was approximately 15% from the second quarter 2016. We now expect full year base business decline to be in the low 30s percentage range. Given this deeper-than-expected erosion for our base business for the quarter and the year, our base business erosion rate in 2017 may be larger than our previous assumption of a return to historic Par annual erosion rates of 10% to 12%. We will update our assumptions on 2017 base erosion as part of our full year 2017 guidance on our year-end earnings call. It is important to note that Par's strategy is focused not on this base segment but on prioritizing growing higher-quality, higher barrier-to-entry products and continuing to advance and replenish our differentiating R&D pipeline. 
Moving on to Slide 8. You will see a chart tracking our new product launches. We have updated to show the 15 products that we have successfully launched so far in 2016. We've had a number of smaller product launches shift into early 2017 and others that we have rationalized due to commercialization assessments and our ongoing portfolio of prioritization but still anticipate that we will launch approximately 20 new products this year, including our first-to-file exclusive products, generic SEROQUEL XR and generic Zetia. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about those 2 key fourth quarter launches. Importantly, we've now launched our generic SEROQUEL XR product. The initial launch has gone smoothly, and all manufacturing, launch activities and product shipments are on track. Our expected December 2016 launch of generic Zetia is also progressing on track. We have received final approval from the FDA and have an agreement in place with Merck through our partner, Glenmark. This product is manufactured through that partnership with Glenmark, and we have a product in our warehouse and we're ready to launch with marketing exclusivity. Together, we expect these 2 first-to-file launches to contribute in line with our previously communicated projections. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Blaise Coleman to discuss the financial performance of the company and the quarter and our projected outlook. Blaise?"
28071,405113130,1080903,"Endo International plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Endo Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have",483,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. First, on Slide 11, you will see a snapshot of the third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we have loss per share of $0.86 in the quarter versus a loss of $3.84 in the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2016 decreased to $191 million compared to a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $804 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during third quarter 2015. On an adjusted basis, overall third quarter results are better than previously guided. 
To summarize the points that Paul made, revenue was strong due to continued performance from XIAFLEX and better than expected due to outperformance by sterile injectables, alternative dosages and select other branded products. Adjusted net income and EPS are better than guided as a result of higher revenues, better gross margin percentage due to product mix and lower operating expenses primarily due to timing. 
On Slide 12, we are again reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EPS full year guidance. We expect revenues to be approximately $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80. Given our overperformance in Q3 versus our expectations, we have increased confidence in our overall full year guidance range, which takes into account several moving parts, including the range of our launch forecast for our first-to-file generic versions of SEROQUEL XR and Zetia, projections around year-end timing of product sales and shipments and continued pricing pressure for our U.S. Generics Base business. 
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 13. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $443 million. We've also highlighted some of the material moving parts that have impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and September year-to-date basis. 
On Slide 14, we are updating our view on estimated free cash flow in 2016. We now project debt paydown of approximately $330 million in 2016 and to exit the year in the high 4x range for our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. While we've provided some color in the past on potential free cash flow headwinds and tailwinds in 2017, given our dynamic sector environment and our ongoing strategic assessment, both of which could impact cash flows in 2017 versus previous expectations, we will wait to provide any details or updates for next year until we provide our full year 2017 financial guidance in late February. 
As noted in our press release, we ended the quarter with approximately $562 million in unrestricted cash, approximately $276 million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 4.9x. 
Now let me turn it back over to Paul."

There are some strategic updates regarding the 2017 market environment that we believe are important to discuss. First, the U.S. Generics competitive landscape and pricing pressures continue to be challenging. Deeper-than-expected base erosion trends that we see and saw in the third quarter indicate stronger headwinds on the front as we exit the year. Steeper-than-anticipated consortium pricing pressures, both in and out of formal bid cycles that we expect to weigh on our generics business moving forward, could impact our adjusted gross margin profile. And our 505(b)(2) expectation and longer-term 505(b)(2) strategy has been impacted by the competitive landscape, regulatory actions and the pricing environment. We will provide more detail and insights into the expected impacts of these trends on our 2017 financial outlook when we provide full year guidance in late February 2017. I would like to note that deeper-than-expected erosion and demand for our products and/or changes to our resource allocation resulting from our strategic assessment could result in changes in the carrying values of assets across our segments. 
Next, XIAFLEX. We've identified XIAFLEX as a core U.S. Branded product and growth driver for Endo moving forward. We continue to put resources and efforts behind accelerating traction and growth in our Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease indications. We're also analyzing our R&D pipeline. Cellulite remains the primary focus there, and we look forward to reporting out on our Phase IIb data upon the completion of that trial. Other potential indications are currently undergoing a full commercial assessment and analysis so that we can best prioritize our R&D efforts and determine clinical trial time lines moving forward. 
The launch of BELBUCA is also progressing. We continue to believe that BELBUCA offers a compelling and differentiated product profile, and we want to ensure that we are best positioned moving forward. 
Finally, as the new CEO, I am spending a lot of time evaluating and working with our legal team to further develop and execute on our strategy with respect to the ongoing mesh litigation. 
On Slide 17, let's talk about my CEO assessment process. As I mentioned, we are pleased to reaffirm our revenue and adjusted EPS full year 2016 financial guidance. Overall, business performance continues to be broadly in line with our expectations. We are in the process of conducting a bottoms-up product-by-product assessment of all 3 of our business units. We expect that we'll be ready to communicate our evolved corporate strategy in the February 2017 time frame of our fourth quarter 2016 earnings announcement. As we've done in the past, we expect that we'll also communicate our full year 2017 financial guidance and expectations for our business at that time. 
In closing, Endo is sharpening its focus on operational execution, and I am excited to be leading the company. I want to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated employees whose hard work and commitment to the company make what we do possible. We continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now let me turn the call back over to Keri to manage our question-and-answer period. Keri?"

I think you've kind of hit the nail on the head. In essence, it's all 3 of those. So the starting point is, really, frankly, we want to start the tone and set the tone of credibility and really taking a real prudent approach here. But when we look at what's happening, we did have anticipated -- essentially higher-than-anticipated pressure from the consortiums, and we did, in essence, see a little more discounting for some of the more established generic competitors, so a little bit of that going on as well. When we see the 20% erosion factor that we talked about, in essence, if we exclude a couple of onetime events, we are more in the 15% erosion for the quarter. And specifically, when you look at the area in which we were -- effect that we had 2 products that were authorized generics, right? So these are products that you know that we -- that are revenue drivers. But in essence, they are large -- they're lower-margin contributors to the Par franchise. So metoprolol and budesonide were 2 products that -- we received additional competition from budesonide, and then we had a little heavier-than-expected competition at Red Oak from a competitor on the metoprolol aging. And structurally, we're seeing some changes at McKesson. As you know, they are moving away from their San Francisco operation, and you're going to start to see a shift in McKesson to their European operation that referred to Claris 1. So they're starting to kick in, and you'll see a change on a go-forward basis as they kind of unite with Walmart."

So we're not going to be able to comment a little bit specifically on the DOJ process, and maybe what we can do is maybe just talk to the facts here. So this is a subpoena that we received over 2 years ago, and I think it's safe to say that we believe that we've cooperated with the DOJ and that there's -- in essence, there's no new information. And as it pertains specifically to Par, it was a focus around 2 products and one product of which we do not even sell. So from that standpoint, we're feeling reasonably confident in our position. At least that's what we believe. And to be specific, the issue deals with a product called doxycycline hyclate. It's a product we do not even sell. There may be some confusion at the DOJ, but we sell a product that was called doxycycline monohydrate. And then the second product is a product called digoxin. And in essence, what occurred there, Par came into an already established market with 2 generic competitors, plus the brand. We were the fourth entrant to an established market, and we never took our price -- there was never a price increase with respect to digoxin. So I think that's probably a statement of fact here by Par, and that's our position."

And we just want to be a little bit mindful and thoughtful on how we communicate this. But when you look at the Par portfolio, the base is really not our focus. When you look at the products in our pipeline, products that we're launching, we're looking at more differentiated products. So we are -- as you know, as we call the portfolio out in some of the historical Qualitest products, we're now really moving to more technically challenging products that should be able to withstand pushback on either the trade or competitors. So we're shifting away from a highly commoditized portfolio as we move forward. So I feel we're going to have more erosion to deal with because the portfolio is still quite large. But over time, as we launch some more products, we should be in a better position to keep our margins at the historical 50 -- low-50 percentage on a go-forward basis."

So 505(b)(2)s has been and will continue to be a part of the Endo-Par strategy, but I break them into 2 categories. When you look at portfolios that are historically in either the injectable portfolio or even some of the legacy Par brands that have shifted over to Endo, those are pure 505(b)(2)s, and we have the resources and the R&D to continue to develop those products. But just to drill into specifically where I think you're headed is when Par undertakes a conversion of an unapproved drug to approved status, and those I break into 2 categories. I'll break those into a category whereby we will continue with our 505(b)(2) strategy of taking unapproved drugs and converting them, running the requisite clinical trials and putting a brand strategy behind that, where that may be detailed either through Joe's Endo team or Tony Pera's injectable team. That we will fight for intellectual property. That falls into one category. When we have intellectual property, it should be normal course. We'll launch the product. It will be priced appropriately for the work in which we've done to gain approval for. And then hopefully, our intellectual property will stick and we have something that we can build upon. Where we're getting some challenges is in the third category, where we develop a 505(b)(2) where we now have a brand we are working with the FDA to remove the unapproved sources, yet we don't have intellectual property. So now we have a timing issue. That's an area that we just need to pause a little bit because the window is a shorter period of time for contribution. So now in today's environment, there are pricing pressures, and we've got to be a little bit mindful of that. So we will continue with the strategy, understanding that when we can get intellectual property, that these 505(b)(2)s, in essence, will behave like a super generic, where we'll have the benefit and contribution driven by volume, but the pricing environment is going to be a little bit tighter and the likelihood is that we will see ANDAs coming at a quicker rate. But that's fine. That's still a meaningful product for the Par portfolio, and we will continue to do that. But that's where we will see a little pressure."

We're not going to disclose specifically our products because we don't want to place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. What I will call out is we don't have the 2 blockbusters that you're seeing right now in Zetia and quetiapine. That we don't have, but you need to remember that we are getting the benefit and the carryover of those 2 products from the fourth quarter of 2016 into the first quarter.

But Sumant, I think one of our advantages, and I said this repeatedly, I think it is a good time for Endo to have sterile injectables facilities on U.S. soil. I think that separates us from the competition. So I'm seeing a lot of quality compliance issues with our competitors. I'm seeing a lot of back order issues. I think this gives us an advantage. And also, I think having a facility on U.S. soil with the R&D team and the manufacturing and quality teams that we have, I think that's an advantage for us. When I look at our product launches, we are always first-to-market in our categories in which we choose to play, and I think that provides a good set point for us as we move forward and ultimately, execute on our GPO contract. So once we do that, we're holding the contract and it's ours to defend. I think that differentiates us. Regarding the question on biosimilars, I know -- we'll come back, I've missed one. But the questions on the biosimilars, while maybe that's not a primary strategy of Par's today, an area that we have focused in on -- and I'm not going to get too deep into it, but we are focusing on polypeptides.

And I think the easier ones for you to understand is right now, there's 2 forms. There's a liquid form, and there's a powder form. The liquid form, you can easily go to IMS data and calculate the units there. We have, in essence, converted the entire market. Maybe you might say the entire market is probably in the very high 90s. So what I'm politely saying is that we've executed, and all the unapproved sources have been off the market for a couple of months. So that, to me, is running nicely. But there's no barrier to entry, so you just have to be aware that an ANDA can be filed. And that product has been approved since, I believe, around 2014. So you just got to make an assumption. At some point, a company that has liquid capabilities can enter the market. The powder is the one that probably has created the most questions because there's so many different forms of powder. And I think in terms of sizing that -- and I think it's safe to say that we -- it's probably easier for us to communicate the number of packets in the market, and then you can go back and do the math. In essence, this is an 18-million-pack market, right? And they're broken into 30s and 100s. I would tell you that's probably irrelevant. But for your math, go back, you're using 18 million packets, and then you can look at standard single-source-type generic pricing. While it's a 505(b)(2), I would make the assumption that it's a single-sourced, highly genericized-type product. That's the way I would think that you should look at the powder. Now having said that, there are still pull-through of unapproved sources. So the unapproved sources were asked to exit the market back in the June time frame, and I believe that they had 2 months to produce product and 3 months to sell through product. So there's going to be a period of time where it's probably going to take us to Q1 before we see that conversion. So I think those are your levers in order to calculate the powder opportunity."

I mean, I think there was about 11 approvals on, I would say, that second tranche. So I believe Actavis came in with maybe 5-week head start based upon a settlement agreement, and then about maybe 9 or 10 companies followed on. So the reality is that while it was a large product, it was -- there was an awful lot of competition. And we had a short burst, and at the end of the day, pricing fell to probably somewhere around 98.5% to 99% off of brand wagon. And again, that's an area that we don't want to compete. That was a decision that was made many, many years ago and the market dynamics changed in that regard. On quetiapine, quetiapine launch is behaving as we expected, so I feel pretty confident about that product on a go-forward basis. The product launch came out on November 1, and we've already taken on around 96%, 97% of the market in terms of signing on accounts. So it's behaving as we expected. In the case of Zetia, the reference that you're making in terms of brand retention, we've taken our -- what we believe is an appropriate approach to the fact that perhaps the brand could retain some percentage based upon maybe some PBM contracts. So that's been taken into consideration. I think what may be important is in this particular product, about 88% of the product is handled through the retail chains. I think that's an important factor. So we feel pretty good about how this product's going to behave, and we've taken in generic conversion in terms of what I think is appropriate.
