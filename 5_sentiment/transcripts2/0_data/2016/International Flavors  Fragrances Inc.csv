I would like to start with my executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash return to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2016 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. 
Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the full year 2015. I'm pleased to report that currency neutral sales grew 5%, which encompasses 6% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Overall, topline growth benefited from a 2 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. In addition, our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency neutral base, continued to benefit from strong new win performance, particularly in Fragrance Compounds, as sales related to new wins finished above our 5-year average. 
For the full year 2015 and on a currency neutral basis, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 8% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 50 basis points. As a result of our sales growth, the benefit associated with cost savings and productivity initiatives, mixed gains related to acquisitions and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement in operating profit, when combined, was a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction in shares outstanding led to a 11% increase in our currency neutral adjusted EPS in 2015. 
While I'm pleased with our results on a full-year base, I'm not satisfied with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. That is driven by a combination of a challenging year-over-year comparison due to an additional week of sales or the 53rd week of 2014, a concentrated effort by some of our larger customers to manage inventories in advance of year end, the portfolio rationalization of one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers and increased economic pressure in key emerging markets such as China. 
We did not perform as well as we would have expected. Alison will go through the specifics in greater detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to highlight the strategic progress we have made as it relates to our Vision 2020 strategy. 
Since the communication of our strategy in June 2, 2015, we have taken steps to deliver on our ambition to achieve target market leadership, defined by #1 or 2 market share positions in key markets, capital risk and customers. Within the emerging markets, we've identified the Middle East and Africa as an area of focus, given the robust economic trends and the impact on our consumer disposable income in the future. I'm happy to report, even as we are very early in our journey, that for the full year, Middle East and Africa were up 14% on a currency neutral basis. 
Similarly with Fragrance Compounds, China grew high single digits as the local teams continue to leverage our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge to win both global and regional customers. 
Consumer Fragrances continued its mid to high single-digit growth trend in 2015. And within that segment, Home Care, an area of focus for us, grew high single digits for the full-year on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. 
In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 16% currently neutral sales growth, driven in part by key customers and our proprietary delivery systems. In 2015, North America, we believe, we are now the #2 flavors company with our acquisition of Ottens Flavors, which will be adding approximately $60 million in annual sales to our business. 
Over the course of the year, we also made strong progress against our innovating first pillar, as we believe our robust technology pipeline is critical to building greater differentiation and ultimately accelerated growth. In quarter 4, we commercialized 2 additional capital Fragrance Ingredients molecules, bringing our total output to 4 in 2015. In addition, the cost of fruit and Crystal Fizz, which I spoke about last quarter, in quarter 4, we commercialized [indiscernible] and [indiscernible], both molecules are strong performers in all applications and give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance for our customers. 
We are proud of these accomplishments as we set up annual fragrance ingredient molecules output average. We believe this is very critical in terms of differentiation and it provides us with greater confidence in our growth and visions going forward. 
The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the fourth quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. The growth trend of encapsulation-related sales continued in 2015 as currency neutral sales improved mid-teens led by Fabric Care and Home Care. 
For the full year 2015, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis, with all geographic markets posting strong growth, led by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. Leveraging our success in Fabric Care, we developed a new capsule in 2015, which will allow us to extend this critical encapsulation technology into Personal Care category such as Hair Care and Body Wash. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to produce strong results, increasing double digits in 2015. The categories where we had the most success were savory, Dairy and Beverage as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of consumers while primarily looking to reduce sugar and salt. 
Building on the strengths, we also commercialized 2 natural pace modulators in 2015. The addition of these modulators will further strengthen our capabilities and it provides our flavors a more competitive element for which to build winning solutions for our customers. 
In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we've also made a progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. In December, we launch our refreshed branding where we unveiled the new website, service statement, visual identity and tone of voice, all of which are geared towards showcasing IFF's vision imagination and innovative focus to customers, employees and, of course, shareholders. 
I'm proud of the recognition we have received from our customers in 2015. Over the course of the year, we won the North American Innovation Award with one of the largest flavors customers which recognizes partners for their [indiscernible] leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder presented us with their Suppliers Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners. Also, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which we acquired in August, over 2015 in Cosmetics Asia Gold award for best active ingredient innovation and best functional ingredient. More recently, they also received first prize of the first Cosmetic Ingredients Show of 2016. 
When it comes sustainability, at IFF, we will not accept the status quo. We believe this is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, which is why we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture. As you can see on this slide, 2015 was a very successful year in terms of accomplishment. 
While the first 3 pillars focus on leveraging or improving our existing capabilities and infrastructure, the fourth pillar strengthening and extending the portfolio aims to support our organic business through M&A partnerships and collaboration. 
During the second and third quarter of 2015, we completed 2 acquisitions. One focusing on growing our market share in North America and one focusing on expanding into new adjacencies which are of strategic value. Both acquisitions in 2015 have performed well and are ahead of our business case in terms of sales growth and margin enhancement. We believe that performance is a good indication that they're allocating towards long-term value creating opportunities. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made from a strategic perspective and I'm committed to continuing this momentum as we move through 2016. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."
281407,322383351,931394,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas.

Giving the softness experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile with what we communicated in our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter with organic sales flat to down slightly in Q4. At that time, as shown in the chart, currency neutral sales on an organic basis was up 2% in October. As you move to November, our growth trajectory continued, with currency neutral sales up nearly 3% for the month. Then, unfortunately, our performance in December came in softer than we expected. While we knew we faced a strong year ago comparisons that included an extra week of sales, which we quantified to be 200 basis points in the quarter or approximately 600 basis points in the month of December, there were a few other factors that further pressured results. 
First, in Flavors, we experienced unprecedented fluctuations in terms of customer order patterns. While traditionally, we have good visibility around the commercialization of products, there were customers recurring order patterns, we ultimately are dependent on our customers in terms of launches and inventory levels. In December, we unexpectedly experienced several large Flavors customers reducing their overall order intake, which impacted results. This was also the case in Consumer Fragrances where customers did not reorder at the same level as they did in the year-ago period, excluding the 53rd week impact. 
In Fragrances, our Ingredients business remained under pressure, as one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers continued to rationalize their product portfolio. In Q4, the impact was even more pronounced, which further pressured results. 
And lastly, we continue to see pressure in Flavors in China, partly due to a weaker economic environment but also some lost business related to the manufacturing issues we faced earlier in the year. 
In light of our challenging currency neutral sales growth, we still managed to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. In the quarter, acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to overall growth. 
There are 2 areas that I want to highlight in terms of our top line in the quarter. The first is Latin America Flavors where we continue to benefit from our industry-leading delivery system technology and take market share from our competition. Also in Latin America, Fine Fragrance has returned to growth in the fourth quarter and volume growth appears to be normalizing and we continue to win new business as we significantly outperformed the market. 
From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis increased 3% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 40 basis points, escrows towards an expansion, the benefits of productivity initiatives, M&A and reduced incentive compensation drove results. Below the line, currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 9%, thanks in large part to a lower adjusted effective tax rate, down 210 basis points and an 830,000 share reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Despite this softer than expected sales and operating profit performance in Q4, we still delivered a solid financial performance on a full-year basis. Currency neutral sales improved 5%. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 8%, and currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q4 was down 3 [ph] basis points, due approximately 28.7% of our 2015 annual sales. 
Much of our gains came from higher payables as a result of a concentrated effort to improve our days payables outstanding. On a full-year basis, our DPO increased by 9 days to 54 days, from 45 days a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the fourth quarter was $434 million, including an incremental $24 million pension contribution. Excluding the incremental portion of the pension contribution, adjusted operating cash flow would have increased to $458 million or 15.2% of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $101 million or approximately 3.3% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finished our plans in Turkey and Indonesia. 
CapEx in 2015 came in below original expectations as the timing of several underpayments will now occur in 2016. As a result, we expect 2016 CapEx will increase to around 5% of sales as we plan to make incremental investments for manufacturing in a new Flavors site in China and to improve our site in India. 
The cash return to shareholders, dividend payments in 2015 were $160 million. This is a direct result of a 20% increase in August as our intention was to provide a more competitive yield, approximately 2%, while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend and remaining flexible to pursue M&A opportunities, we spent $122 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we've repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding to 80.4 million shares. While combining both dividends and share repurchases, we achieved a 66% total payout ratio for adjusted net income, exceeding our targeted range of 50% to 60% and significantly ahead of prior year. Looking ahead to 2016, we can reiterate our targeted total payout ratio range of 50% to 60%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2016, I want to provide an assessment of our vantage point as we stand here today. Basically, there are 4 key themes that we believe are relevant when planning our financial goals for 2016. 
From an economic perspective, there's a lot of solidity around the world. While the developed markets of the U.S. and Western Europe appear to improving slowly and the emerging markets, the volatility we experienced in the second half of 2015 continues. Large markets like China appear to be decelerating and Brazil continues to decline. These 2 markets account for approximately 15% of our total sales. 
With regard to multinational consumer product companies. Volume expectations seem to be muted as many organizations appear to be focused on improving margins while taking pricing actions. And emerging markets to protect profitability. Fortunately, regional players continue to exhibit stronger volume trends, whether it be in the U.S. or in the emerging markets. This economic uncertainty has led to sharp declines in hard commodities such as oil, which is beneficial in terms of cost. This large decline in petrochemical should help in terms of input cost. Also, we continue to see naturals such as vanilla and citrus remaining elevated. 
Finally, in terms of foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against world currencies. This continues to be a challenge for most multinational companies based in the U.S. both in terms of translation and transaction exposure. 
With all that as context, we are preparing ourselves for even more challenging conditions given the higher level of economic uncertainty and the more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. We expect 3.5 to 4.5 currency neutral sales growth including approximately a 1.5 percentage point contribution on the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to be largely driven by Consumer Fragrances as well as Latin America and EAME and Flavors. 
From an operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of the contribution of M&A. This improvement should be a result of gross margin expansion and productivity initiatives that more than offset the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program and investments in our strategy 2020. Both of which, Alison will touch on a moment. 
Currency neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Longer-term, we continue to believe that over the 2016, 2020 horizon, we can deliver our Vision 2020 financial targets. We believe our emphasis on building greater differentiation, specifically in R&D, should ultimately lead to higher growth rates in the years to come. 
And in light of the recent instability in the financial markets around the world, I want to take a moment to reemphasize that IFF is a diversified and competitively advantaged organization. Whether you analyze our portfolio by category, region or customer, the breadth and diversity of our portfolio is great and our innovative solutions are key components of consumer staple products that enjoy long-term growth stability. We believe that our management team, as well as all IFF employees are capable of executing on our strategy 2020 to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that we can deliver organic currency neutral growth turn targets of 4% to 6% growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth over the course of '16 to 2020. 
With that, I would like to ask Alison to provide some additional remarks on our profitability outlook and foreign exchange exposure."
281407,322383351,931394,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Given the many moving parts, I wanted to provide additional insights and transparency into our expected profitability goal for 2016.

In the table, we anchored on full-year 2015 adjusted operating profit and built out a reconciliation to bridge the 2016 operating profit. 
Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately a 4.5 percentage point headwind related to the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program. For those of you who are not familiar, we at IFF are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. From time to time, there are variations in our incentive compensation that is based on our performance relative to our annual plan. If we achieve our full-year financial targets, which are comprised of currency neutral sales growth, gross margin as a percentage of sales and absolute level of operating profit and working capital as a percentage of sales, we will receive 100% of our designated payout. Should be we overperform or under perform our annual plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower, respectively. 
Since in 2015 we underperformed on a few components of our plan, our payout was below 100%. Now as we reset our targets in 2016, we budget for 100% payout, which ultimately is the driver behind the year-over-year variance. 
In the third bar, we've identified incremental investments we're making in Vision 2020. These are critical strategic investments. For example, R&D, application and commercial, geared toward delivering our long-term strategic and financial objectives. As we communicated on our Investor Day, we committed to self fund our reinvestment opportunities. 
In the fourth bar, you can see that we are aggressively attacking our cost base to not only cover our incremental investments but also help to deliver on our short-term profitability objectives. In addition to our standard course and productivity initiatives, which includes the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies, we identified incremental savings opportunities via our Fund the Journey program. During the fourth quarter, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve our global manufacturing and operations network. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately $8 million to cover severance and related costs associated with expected termination, a portion of which are subject to consultation processes. 
The company expects to realize pretax savings of $7 million to $9 million when fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016, which is included in our 2016 guidance. 
Separately, the company recorded a charge of approximately $7 million associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the Aromor acquisition that was treated by certain of the effect of positions noted above. Then, the combination of our operational performance inclusive of M&A is expected to deliver 4% to 7% currency neutral operating profit growth. 
We expect foreign exchange, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment, will have a 5 percentage point impact, bring our reported operating profit to be flat to up 2% in 2016. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide some additional insight into our foreign exchange exposure. Although 51% of our sales are to the emerging markets, not all of these sales are denominated in local currency. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies we had to price in local emerging market currencies. 
As you can see in this chart, of the 51% of our sales in 2015 that weren't in emerging markets, approximately 70% were denominated in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, leaving only 30% that are denominated in American market currency. As a result, our foreign exchange exposure to emerging markets currencies is rather limited. This is important, especially as we continue to see the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most emerging market currency. 
Given that fact, it's clear that the key hard currencies have been most impact on our profitability. Starting with the top box, we look at our profitability exposure. As we progress into 2016, while the Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Thai baht and Australian dollar are presenting modest headwinds in terms of currency, the euro is clearly the largest driver. As you can see, the devaluation of the euro versus U.S. dollars is expected to represent approximately 4 out of our 5 percentage point headwind in 2016. While we are hedged approximately 75% at 1 14 in 2016, the impact on profitability is about 2.5 percentage points plus the year-over-year variance of a hedging benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
To allow you to more accurately forecast the exchange rate volatility, I've included our 2015 exchange rate as well as our planning rate for 2016. We hope that by giving you these details, you have greater visibility into our currency exposure as you can calculate the percentage change in each specific currency and the multiple -- and multiply by the percentage of profit each currency represents. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some concluding remarks."

So we don't expect that we see a restocking effect here, so that's first part of the business. We've increase pipeline, project pipeline, particularly on the Fragrance Compounds side and also on the Flavors side so we see that this is good and very, very solid in Compounds. Fragrance, I would see it even for the average we've seen before. So that's good. On the Flavors side, we see that projects are happening and we have projects but not [indiscernible] executed for our customers and it depends how, let's say, how much they're selling them of the product. [indiscernible]side. On the geographic side, would we see is U.S. and Europe are actually pretty okay, coming back. We see a bit of the softness, in particular, in some of the emerging markets like China. And we should not forget that if we look at our customers in particular, the big CPG customers, that the outlook for volume is relatively muted. The good thing is, we don't see this with all of our regional and local customers. And as you know, our customers split is 50-50 with the big clients and the small one. So a bit of a long-winded answer. But there are really different different pieces to be looked at for 2016. I hope it helps."

My sense is that the CPG customers that, at least over the last 6 months, I mean, your outlook certainly hasn't improved. But I don't really feel that there's been that much change in or out in terms of global market growth or volume growth. Maybe that it's not getting better as quickly as you hope. But it certainly doesn't sound to me like it is worse. So I'm wondering if you're also seeing end market demand flow for those regional and local customers that the macro is now trickling into total market demand not just a bit of a share shift that you see happening. So that was my first question. The second was on the decision to invest in the new China Flavors facility. How does that tie into the existing manufacturing plant or I guess there's two. But the one that you had kind of the emissions issues in the summer. Can you just give us more color on that, that will be great. Thank you."

We're back with our manufacturing of having settled that has cost us some business over the course of 2015. Coming back to your first question. What we see is a deceleration of order patterns with our global customers. And that's something which is certainly impacting the business. It depends certainly customer by customer and region by region so we really have to go into more of a detail. But still, for the smaller regional and local customers, it's -- the -- I would say, the assessment states that you have a couple of companies which have faster growth here. And it's actually good for us because we do significant business with these customers as well. I hope that helps."

We see a deceleration of orders and we think that had to do with our order abatement issues that we experienced. But beyond that, our current pipeline is lower from a new breed perspective because we believe our clients are concerned a bit about not having a backup site in China and look for alternative suppliers in the short term. We believe once we've rectified that issue, there will be no issues from a volume perspective. But say, beyond that, I wanted to add to a variance comment about [indiscernible] and FX. Because the way that our clients or our competitors measure, they actually take the benefit of pricing in terms of their growth rate and so it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison as reported. And so you need to essentially stack the results down by maybe 1/3 to have an apples-to-apples comparison and then you take -- if you do that, you'll see on a full-year basis we're in fact performing better than our competition. The other distinction I wanted to make was when commenting in terms of China and share and brief, the comment is in particular to Flavors and not Fragrance because we are growing in the Fragrance space in China."

I would like to start with my executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison",1355,"Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with my executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash returned to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2016 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. 
Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the full-year 2015. I'm pleased to report that currency neutral sales grew 5%, which encompasses 6% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Overall, top line growth benefited from a 2 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. In addition, our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency neutral base, continued to benefit from strong new win performance, particularly in Fragrance Compounds, as sales related to new wins finished above our 5-year average. 
For the full-year 2015 and on a currency neutral basis, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 8% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 50 basis points. As a result of our sales growth, the benefit associated with cost savings and productivity initiatives, mixed gains related to acquisitions and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement in operating profit, when combined, was a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 11% increase in our currency neutral adjusted EPS in 2015. 
While I'm pleased with our results on a full-year base, I'm not satisfied with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. That is driven by a combination of a challenging year-over-year comparison due to an additional week of sales, or the 53rd week of 2014, a concentrated effort by some of our larger customers to manage inventories in advance of year-end, the portfolio rationalization of one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers and an increased economic pressure in key emerging markets such as China. 
We did not perform as well as we would have expected. Alison will go through the specifics in greater detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to highlight the strategic progress we have made as it relates to our Vision 2020 strategy. 
Since the communication of our strategy in June 2, 2015, we have taken steps to deliver on our ambition to achieve target market leadership, defined by #1 or #2 market share positions in key markets, capital risk and customers. Within the emerging markets, we've identified the Middle East and Africa as an area of focus, given the robust economic trends and the impact on our consumer disposable income in the future. I'm happy to report, even as we are very early in our journey, that for the full year, Middle East and Africa were up 14% on a currency neutral basis. 
Similarly, with Fragrance Compounds, China grew high single digits as the local teams continue to leverage our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge to win both global and regional customers. 
Consumer Fragrances continued its mid- to high single-digit growth trend in 2015. And within that segment, Home Care, an area of focus for us, grew high single digits for the full year on a currency neutral basis, led by a double-digit growth in Latin America. 
In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 16% currency neutral sales growth, driven in part by key customers and our proprietary delivery systems. In 2015, in North America, we believe we are now the #2 flavors company with our acquisition of Ottens Flavors, which will be adding approximately $60 million in annual sales to our business. 
Over the course of the year, we also made strong progress against our innovating first pillar, as we believe our robust technology pipeline is critical to building greater differentiation and ultimately, accelerated growth. In quarter 4, we commercialized 2 additional capital Fragrance Ingredients molecules, bringing our total output to 4 in 2015. In addition, the cost of fruit and crystal fizz, which I spoke about last quarter, in quarter 4, we commercialized Amber Tonic [ph] and Cool Wood [ph], both molecules are strong performers in all applications and give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance for our customers. 
We are proud of these accomplishments as we set up annual fragrance ingredients molecule output average. We believe this is very critical in terms of differentiation and it provides us with greater confidence in our growth and visions going forward. 
The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the fourth quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. The growth trend of encapsulation-related sales continued in 2015 as currency neutral sales improved mid-teens led by Fabric Care and Home Care. 
For the full-year 2015, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis, with all geographic markets posting strong growth, led by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. Leveraging our success in Fabric Care, we developed a new capsule in 2015, which will allow us to extend this critical encapsulation technology into Personal Care categories such as Hair Care and Body Wash. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to produce strong results, increasing double digits in 2015. The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of consumers while primarily looking to reduce sugar and salt. 
Building on the strengths, we also commercialized 2 natural taste modulators in 2015. The addition of these modulators will further strengthen our capabilities and it provides our flavors a more competitive palate for which we've built winning solutions for our customers. 
In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we've also made a progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. In December, we launched our refreshed branding where we unveiled the new website, service statement, visual identity and tone of voice, all of which are geared towards showcasing IFF's vision imagination and innovative focus to customers, employees and, of course, shareholders. 
I'm proud of the recognition we have received from our customers in 2015. Over the course of the year, we won the North America Innovation Award as one of the largest flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder presented us with their Suppliers Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners. Also, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, when we acquired in August, won the 2015, in Cosmetics Asia, Gold Award for best active ingredient innovation and best functional ingredient. More recently, they also received first prize of the first Cosmetic Ingredients Show of 2016. 
When it comes to sustainability, at IFF, we will not accept the status quo. We believe this is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, which is why we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture. As you can see on this slide, 2015 was a very successful year in terms of accomplishment. 
While the first 3 pillars focus on leveraging or improving our existing capabilities and infrastructure, the fourth pillar strengthening and extending the portfolio aims to support our organic business through M&A partnerships and collaborations. 
During the second and third quarter 2015, we completed 2 acquisitions: one focusing  on growing our market share in North America; and one focusing on expanding into new adjacencies which have strategic value. Both acquisitions in 2015 have performed well and are ahead of our business case in terms of sales growth and margin enhancement. We believe that performance is a good indication that we're allocating capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made from a strategic perspective, and I'm committed to continuing this momentum as we move through 2016. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."
281407,322383351,931766,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Given the softness experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results.

Given the softness experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter, with organic sales flat to down slightly in Q4. At that time, as shown in the chart, currency neutral sales on an organic basis was up 2% in October. As we move to November, our growth trajectory continued, with currency neutral sales up nearly 3% for the month. Then, unfortunately, our performance in December came in softer than we expected. While we knew we faced a strong year ago comparisons that included an extra week of sales, which we quantified to be 200 basis points in the quarter or approximately 600 basis points in the month of December, there were a few other factors that further pressured results. 
First, in Flavors, we experienced unprecedented fluctuations in terms of customer order patterns. While traditionally, we have good visibility around the commercialization of products and our customers' recurring order patterns, we ultimately are dependent on our customers in terms of launches and inventory levels. In December, we unexpectedly experienced several large Flavors customers reducing their overall order intake, which impacted results. This was also the case in Consumer Fragrances, where customers did not reorder at the same level as they did in the year-ago period, excluding the 53rd-week impact. 
In Fragrances, our Ingredients business remained under pressure, as one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers continued to rationalize their product portfolio. In Q4, the impact was even more pronounced, which further pressured results.
And lastly, we continue to see pressure in Flavors in China, partly due to a weaker economic environment but also some lost business related to the manufacturing issues we faced earlier in the year. 
In light of our challenging currency neutral sales growth, we still manage to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. In the quarter, acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to overall growth. 
There are 2 areas that I want to highlight in terms of our top line in the quarter. The first is Latin America Flavors, where we continue to benefit from our industry-leading delivery system technology and take market share from our competition. Also in Latin America, Fine Fragrance has returned to growth in the fourth quarter and volume erosion appears to be normalizing and we continue to win new business as we significantly outperformed the market. 
From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis increased 3% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion, the benefits of productivity initiatives, M&A and reduced incentive compensation drove results. Below the line, currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 9%, thanks in large part to a lower adjusted effective tax rate, down 210 basis points and an 830,000 share reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Despite this softer-than-expected sales and operating profit performance in Q4, we still delivered a solid financial performance on a full-year basis. Currency neutral sales improved 5%, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 8% and currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement year-over-year as the percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q4 was down 40 basis points, to approximately 28.7% of our 2015 annual sales. 
Much of our gains came from higher payables as a result of the concentrated efforts to improve our days payables outstanding. On a full-year basis, our DPO increased by 9 days to 54 days, from 45 days a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the fourth quarter was $434 million, including an incremental $24 million pension contribution. Excluding the incremental portion of the pension contribution, adjusted operating cash flow would have increased to $458 million or 15.2% of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $101 million or approximately 3.3% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finish our plans in Turkey and Indonesia. 
CapEx in 2015 came in below original expectations and the timing of several underpayments will now occur in 2016. As a result, we expect 2016 CapEx will increase to around 5% of sales as we plan to make incremental investments for manufacturing in a new Flavors site in China and to improve our site in India. 
For cash return to shareholders, dividend payments in 2015 were $160 million. This is a direct result of a 20% increase in August as our intention was to provide a more competitive yield, approximately 2%, while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend and remaining flexible to pursue M&A opportunities, we spent $122 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we've repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding to 80.4 million shares. When combining both dividends and share repurchases, we achieved a 66% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our targeted range of 50% to 60% and significantly ahead of prior year. Looking ahead to 2016, we can reiterate our targeted total payout ratio range of 50% to 60%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2016, I want to provide an assessment of our vantage point as we stand here today. Basically, there are 4 key themes that we believe are relevant when planning our financial goals for 2016. 
From an economic perspective, there's a lot of fluidity around the world. While the developed markets of the U.S. and Western Europe appear to be improving slowly, in the emerging markets, the volatility we experienced in the second half of 2015 continues. Large markets like China appear to be decelerating and Brazil continues to decline. These 2 markets account for approximately 15% of our total sales. 
With regard to multinational consumer product companies, volume expectations seem to be muted as many organizations appear to be focused on improving margins while taking pricing actions in emerging markets to protect profitability. Fortunately, regional players continue to exhibit stronger volume trends, whether it be in the U.S. or in the emerging markets. This economic uncertainty has led to sharp declines in hard commodities such as oil, which is beneficial in terms of cost. This large decline in petrochemical should help in terms of input cost, although, we continue to see naturals such as vanilla and citrus remaining elevated. 
Finally, in terms of foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against world currencies. This continues to be a challenge for most multinational companies based in the U.S., both in terms of translation and transaction exposure. 
With all that as context, we are preparing ourselves for even more challenging conditions given the higher level of economic uncertainty and the more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. We expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5 percentage point contribution on the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to be largely driven by Consumer Fragrances as well as Latin America and EAME and Flavors. 
From an operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of the contribution of M&A. This improvement should be a result of gross margin expansion and productivity initiatives that more than offset the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program and investments in our strategy 2020. Both of which, Alison will touch on in a moment. 
Currency neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Longer term, we continue to believe that over the 2016, 2020 horizon, we can deliver our Vision 2020 financial targets. We believe our emphasis on building greater differentiation, specifically in R&D, should ultimately lead to higher growth rates in the years to come. 
And in light of the recent instability in the financial markets around the world, I want to take a moment to reemphasize that IFF is a diversified and competitively advantaged organization. Whether you analyze our portfolio by category, region or customer, the breadth and diversity of our portfolio is great and our innovative solutions are key components of consumer staple products that enjoy long-term growth stability. We believe that our management team, as well as IFF employees, are capable of executing on our strategy 2020 to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that we can deliver organic currency neutral growth term targets of 4% to 6% growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth over the course of '16 to 2020. 
With that, I would like to ask Alison to provide some additional remarks on our profitability outlook and foreign exchange exposure."
281407,322383351,931766,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Given the many moving parts, I wanted to provide additional insights and transparency into our expected profitability goal for 2016.

In the table, we anchored on full-year 2015 adjusted operating profit and built out a reconciliation to bridge the 2016 operating profit. 
Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately a 4.5 percentage point headwind related to the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program. For those of you who are not familiar, we at IFF are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. From time to time, there are variations in incentive compensation as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plans. If we achieve our full-year financial targets, which are comprised of currency neutral sales growth, gross margin as a percentage of sales and absolute level of operating profit and working capital as a percentage of sales, we will receive 100% of our designated payout. Should be we overperform or underperform our annual plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower, respectively. 
Since in 2015, we underperformed on a few components of our plan, our payout was below 100%. Now as we reset our targets in 2016, we budget for 100% payout, which ultimately is the driver behind the year-over-year variance. 
In the third bar, we've identified the incremental investments we are making in Vision 2020. These are critical strategic investments. For example, R&D, application and commercial, geared toward delivering our long-term strategic and financial objectives. As we communicated on our Investor Day, we committed to self fund our reinvestment opportunities. 
In the fourth bar, you can see that we are aggressively attacking our cost base to not only cover our incremental investments but also help to deliver on our short-term profitability objectives. In addition to our standard course and productivity initiatives, which includes the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies, we identified incremental savings opportunities via our Fund the Journey program. During the fourth quarter, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve our global manufacturing and operations network. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately $8 million to cover severance and related costs associated with expected termination, a portion of which are subject to consultation processes. 
The company expects to realize pretax savings of $7 million to $9 million when fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016, which is included in our 2016 guidance. 
Separately, the company recorded a charge of approximately $7 million associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the Aromor acquisition that was treated by certain of the effect of positions noted above. Then, the combination of our operational performance, inclusive of M&A, is expected to deliver 4% to 7% currency neutral operating profit growth. 
We expect foreign exchange, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment, will have a 5 percentage point impact, bringing our reported operating profit to be flat to up 2% in 2016. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide some additional insight into our foreign exchange exposure. Although 51% of our sales are to the emerging markets, not all of these sales are denominated in local currency. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies and we have to price in local emerging market currencies.
As you can see in this chart, of the 51% of our sales in 2015 that were to emerging markets, approximately 70% were denominated in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, leaving only 30% that are denominated in American market currencies. As a result, our foreign exchange exposure to emerging markets currencies is rather limited. This is important, especially as we continue to see the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most emerging market currencies. 
Given that fact, it's clear that the key hard currencies have the most impact on our profitability. Starting with the top box, we look at our profitability exposure. As we progress into 2016, while the Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Thai baht and Australian dollar are presenting modest headwinds in terms of currency, the euro is clearly the largest driver. As you can see, the devaluation of the euro versus U.S. dollar is expected to represent approximately 4 out of our 5 percentage point headwind in 2016. While we are hedged approximately 75% at 1.14% in 2016, the impact on profitability is about 2.5 percentage points plus the year-over-year variance of the hedging benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
To allow you to more accurately forecast the exchange rate volatility, I've included our 2015 exchange rate as well as our planning rate for 2016. We hope that by giving you these details, you'll have greater visibility into our currency exposure as you can calculate the percentage change in each specific currency and the multiple -- then multiply by the percentage of profit each currency represents. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some concluding remarks."

So that's first part of the business. We have good pipeline, project pipeline, particularly on the Fragrance Compounds side and also on the Flavors side, so we see that this is good and very, very solid in Compounds. Fragrance, I would see, it's even for the average we've seen before. So that's good. On the Flavors side, we see that projects are happening and we have projects that's not always executed by our customers and it depends how, let's say, how much they are selling them of the product, especially on the category side. On the geographic side, what we see is U.S. and Europe are actually pretty okay, coming back. We see a bit of a softness, in particular, in some of the emerging markets like China. And we should not forget that if we look at our customers, in particular, the big CPG customers, that the outlook for volume is relatively muted. The good thing is we don't see this with all of our regional and local customers. And as you know, our customer split is 50-50, with the big clients and the small one. So a bit of a long-winded answer. But there are really different pieces to be looked at for 2016. I hope it helps."

My sense is that the CPG customers that, at least over the last 6 months -- I mean, your outlook certainly hasn't improved, but I don't really feel like there's been that much change in their outlook in terms of global market growth or volume growth. Maybe that it's not getting better as quickly as they'd hope, but it certainly doesn't sound to me like it's worst. So I'm wondering if you're also seeing end market demand flow for those regional and local customers that the macro is now trickling in total market demand, not just a bit of the share shift that you had seen happening. So that was my first question. The second was on the decision to invest in the new China Flavors facility. How does that tie into the existing manufacturing plant -- which I guess, there's 2, but the one where you had kind of the emissions issues this summer. If you can just give us a little more color on that, it'll be great."

We have made the decision that we are -- we'll invest in the second plant. We plan to start groundbreaking at the end of the year and that will deliver us with, let's say, a backup plan for China for a market where we still believe we have to be present with a second plant for the volume. So that's actually on track. On our existing Flavors plant, we had -- earlier last year, we had the odor issue and it have salted, so far, on the Flavors side. So that's working. We are back with our manufacturing of having settled that has cost us some business over the course of 2015. Coming back to your first question. What we see is a deceleration of order patterns with our global customers, and that's something which is certainly impacting the business. It depends, certainly, customer by customer and region by region, so we really have to go into more of a detail. But still, for the smaller regional and local customers, it's the -- I would say, the assessment states that you'll have a couple of companies which have faster growth here. And that's actually good for us because we do significant business with these customers as well. I hope that helps."

But in talking to them, we've tried to quantify the difference and it seems like they're doing a lot better than you, even on a 2-year stack basis in various sort of geographies and categories. And I'm particularly interested in China because they have been talking up China and telling investors that China's coming back and they're doing a lot better with the local regional players. So that indicates that you're looking shares. So I just wonder if you can shed some light on that and if you're concerned about that."

We see a deceleration of orders and we think that certainly had to do with our odor abatement issues that we experienced. But beyond that, our current pipeline is lower from a new breed perspective because we believe our clients are concerned a bit about not having a backup site in China and look for alternative suppliers in the short term. We believe once we've rectified that issue, there will be no issue from a volume perspective. So beyond that, I wanted to add to Andreas' comment about FX. Because the way that our clients or our competitors measure, they actually take the benefit of pricing in terms of their growth rate, and so it's not nearly an apples-to-apples comparison as reported. So you need to essentially stack the results down by maybe 1/3 to have an apples-to-apples comparison. And if you take -- if you do that, you'll see on a full-year basis we're in fact performing better than our competition. The other distinction I wanted to make was when commenting in terms of China and share and briefs, the comment is in particular to Flavors and not Fragrance because we are growing in the Fragrance space in China."

I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison",1355,"Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash returned to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2016 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. 
Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the full-year 2015. I'm pleased to report that currency neutral sales grew 5%, which encompasses 6% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Overall, top line growth benefited from a 2 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. In addition, our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency neutral base, continued to benefit from strong new win performance, particularly in Fragrance Compounds, as sales related to new wins finished above our 5-year average. 
For the full-year 2015 and on a currency neutral basis, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 8% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 50 basis points as a result of our sales growth, the benefit associated with cost savings and productivity initiatives, mixed gains related to acquisitions and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement in operating profit, when combined with a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 11% increase in our currency neutral adjusted EPS in 2015. 
While I'm pleased with our results on a full-year base, I'm not satisfied with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. That is driven by a combination of a challenging year-over-year comparison due to an additional week of sales, or the 53rd week in 2014, a concentrated effort by some of our larger customers to manage inventories in advance of year-end, the portfolio rationalization of one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers and an increased economic pressure in key emerging markets such as China. 
We did not perform as well as we would have expected. Alison will go through the specifics in greater detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to highlight the strategic progress we have made as it relates to our Vision 2020 strategy. 
Since the communication of our strategy in June 2, 2015, we have taken steps to deliver on our ambition to achieve target market leadership, defined by #1 or #2 market share positions in key markets, capital risk and customers. Within the emerging markets, we've identified the Middle East and Africa as an area of focus, given the robust economic trends and the impact on our consumer disposable income in the future. I'm happy to report, even as we are very early in our journey, that for the full year, Middle East and Africa were up 14% on a currency neutral basis. 
Similarly, with Fragrance Compounds, China grew high single digits as the local teams continue to leverage our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge to win both global and regional customers. 
Consumer Fragrances continued its mid- to high single-digit growth trend in 2015. And within that segment, Home Care, an area of focus for us, grew high single digits for the full year on a currency neutral basis, led by a double-digit growth in Latin America. 
In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 16% currency neutral sales growth, driven in part by key customers and our proprietary delivery systems. In 2015, in North America, we believe we are now the #2 flavors company with our acquisition of Ottens Flavors, which will be adding approximately $60 million in annual sales to our business. 
Over the course of the year, we also made strong progress against our innovating first pillar, as we believe our robust technology pipeline is critical to building greater differentiation and ultimately, accelerated growth. In quarter 4, we commercialized 2 additional capital Fragrance Ingredients molecules, bringing our total output to 4 in 2015. In addition, the cost of fruit and crystal fizz, which I spoke about last quarter, in quarter 4, we commercialized Amber Tonic [ph] and Cool Wood [ph], both molecules are strong performers in all applications and give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance for our customers. 
We are proud of these accomplishments as we set up annual fragrance ingredients molecule output average. We believe this is very critical in terms of differentiation and it provides us with greater confidence in our growth and visions going forward. 
The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the fourth quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. The growth trend of encapsulation-related sales continued in 2015 as currency neutral sales improved mid-teens led by Fabric Care and Home Care. 
For the full-year 2015, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis, with all geographic markets posting strong growth, led by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. Leveraging our success in Fabric Care, we developed a new capsule in 2015, which will allow us to extend this critical encapsulation technology into Personal Care categories such as Hair Care and Body Wash. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to produce strong results, increasing double digits in 2015. The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of consumers while primarily looking to reduce sugar and salt. 
Building on the strengths, we also commercialized 2 natural taste modulators in 2015. The addition of these modulators will further strengthen our capabilities and it provides our flavors a more competitive palate from which we've built winning solutions for our customers. 
In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we've also made a progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. In December, we launched our refreshed branding where we unveiled the new website, service statement, visual identity and tone of voice, all of which are geared towards showcasing IFF's vision, imagination and innovative focus to customers, employees and, of course, shareholders. 
I'm proud of the recognition we have received from our customers in 2015. Over the course of the year, we won the North America Innovation Award as one of the largest flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder presented us with their Suppliers Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners. Also, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, who we acquired in August, won the 2015, in Cosmetics Asia, Gold Award for best active ingredient innovation and best functional ingredient. More recently, they also received first prize of the first Cosmetic Ingredients Show of 2016. 
When it comes to sustainability, at IFF, we will not accept the status quo. We believe this is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, which is why we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture. As you can see on this slide, 2015 was a very successful year in terms of accomplishment. 
While the first 3 pillars focus on leveraging or improving our existing capabilities and infrastructure, the fourth pillar strengthening and extending the portfolio aims to support our organic business through M&A partnerships and collaborations. 
During the second and third quarter 2015, we completed 2 acquisitions: one focusing on growing our market share in North America; and one focusing on expanding into new adjacencies which have strategic value. Both acquisitions in 2015 have performed well and are ahead of our business case in terms of sales growth and margin enhancement. We believe that performance is a good indication that we're allocating capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made from a strategic perspective, and I'm committed to continuing this momentum as we move through 2016. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

Given the softness that we experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency",912,"Thank you, Andreas. Given the softness that we experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter, with organic sales flat to down slightly in Q4. At that time, as shown in the chart, currency neutral sales on an organic basis was up 2% in October. As we move to November, our growth trajectory continued, with currency neutral sales up nearly 3% for the month. Then, unfortunately, our performance in December came in softer than we expected. While we knew we faced a strong year ago comparison that included an extra week of sales, which we quantified to be 200 basis points in the quarter or approximately 600 basis points in the month of December, there were a few other factors that further pressured results. 
First, in Flavors, we experienced unprecedented fluctuations in terms of customer order patterns. While traditionally, we have good visibility around the commercialization of products and our customers' recurring order patterns, we ultimately are dependent on our customers in terms of launches and inventory levels. In December, we unexpectedly experienced several large Flavors customers reducing their overall order intake, which impacted results. This was also the case in Consumer Fragrances, where customers did not reorder at the same level as they did in the year-ago period, excluding the 53rd-week impact. 
In Fragrances, our Ingredients business remained under pressure, as one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers continued to rationalize their product portfolio. In Q4, the impact was even more pronounced, which further pressured results.
And lastly, we continue to see pressure in Flavors in China, partly due to a weaker economic environment but also some lost business relating to the manufacturing issues we faced earlier in the year. 
In light of our challenging currency neutral sales growth, we still manage to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. In the quarter, acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to overall growth. 
There are 2 areas that I want to highlight in terms of our top line in the quarter. The first is Latin America Flavors, where we continue to benefit from our industry-leading delivery system technology and take market share from our competition. Also in Latin America, Fine Fragrance has returned to growth in the fourth quarter as volume erosion appears to be normalizing and we continue to win new business as we significantly outperform the market. 
From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis increased 3% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion, the benefits of productivity initiatives, M&A and reduced incentive compensation drove results. Below the line, currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 9%, thanks in large part to a lower adjusted effective tax rate, down 210 basis points and an 830,000 share reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Despite the softer-than-expected sales and operating profit performance in Q4, we still delivered a solid financial performance on a full-year basis. Currency neutral sales improved 5%, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 8% and currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as the percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q4 was down 40 basis points, to approximately 28.7% of our 2015 annual sales. 
Much of our gains came from higher payables as a result of the concentrated efforts to improve our days payables outstanding. On a full-year basis, our DPO increased by 9 days to 54 days, from 45 days a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the fourth quarter was $434 million, including an incremental $24 million pension contribution. Excluding the incremental portion of the pension contribution, adjusted operating cash flow would have increased to $458 million or 15.2% of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $101 million or approximately 3.3% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finished our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. 
CapEx in 2015 came in below original expectations as the timing of several vendor payments will now occur in 2016. As a result, we expect 2016 CapEx will increase to around 5% of sales as we plan to make incremental investments for manufacturing in a new Flavors site in China and to improve our site in India. 
For cash return to shareholders, dividend payments in 2015 were $160 million. This is a direct result of a 20% increase in August as our intention was to provide a more competitive yield, approximately 2%, while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend and remaining flexible to pursue M&A opportunities, we spent $122 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we've repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding to 80.4 million shares. When combining both dividends and share repurchases, we achieved a 66% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our targeted range of 50% to 60% and significantly ahead of prior year. Looking ahead to 2016, we can reiterate our targeted total payout ratio range of 50% to 60%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2016, I want to provide an assessment of our vantage point as we stand here today. Basically, there are 4 key themes that we believe are relevant when planning our financial goals for 2016. 
From an economic perspective, there's a lot of fluidity around the world. While the developed markets of the U.S. and Western Europe appear to be improving slowly, in the emerging markets, the volatility we experienced in the second half of 2015 continues. Large markets like China appear to be decelerating and Brazil continues to decline. These 2 markets account for approximately 15% of our total sales. 
With regard to multinational consumer product companies, volume expectations seem to be muted as many organizations appear to be focused on improving margins while taking pricing actions in emerging markets to protect profitability. Fortunately, regional players continue to exhibit stronger volume trends, whether it be in the U.S. or in the emerging markets. This economic uncertainty has led to sharp declines in hard commodities such as oil, which is beneficial in terms of cost. This large decline in petrochemical should help in terms of input cost, although we continue to see naturals such as vanilla and citrus remaining elevated. 
Finally, in terms of foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against world currencies. This continues to be a challenge for most multinational companies based in the U.S., both in terms of translation and transaction exposure. 
With all that as context, we are preparing ourselves for even more challenging conditions given the higher level of economic uncertainty and the more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. We expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5 percentage point contribution on the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to be largely driven by Consumer Fragrances as well as Latin America and EAME and Flavors. 
From an operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of the contribution of M&A. This improvement should be a result of gross margin expansion and productivity initiatives that more than offset the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program and investments in our strategy 2020. Both of which, Alison will touch on in a moment. 
Currency neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Longer term, we continue to believe that over the 2016, 2020 horizon, we can deliver our Vision 2020 financial targets. We believe our emphasis on building greater differentiation, specifically in R&D, should ultimately lead to higher growth rates in the years to come. 
And in light of the recent instability in the financial markets around the world, I want to take a moment to reemphasize that IFF is a diversified and competitively advantaged organization. Whether you analyze our portfolio by category, region or customer, the breadth and diversity of our portfolio is great and our innovative solutions are key components of consumer staple products that enjoy long-term growth stability. We believe that our management team, as well as all IFF employees, are capable of executing on our strategy 2020 to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that we can deliver organic currency neutral growth term targets of 4% to 6% growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth over the course of '16 to 2020. 
With that, I would like to ask Alison to provide some additional remarks on our profitability outlook and foreign exchange exposure."
281407,322383351,931982,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Given the many moving parts, I wanted to provide additional insights and transparency into our expected profitability goal for 2016.

In the table, we anchored on full-year 2015 adjusted operating profit and built out a reconciliation to bridge the 2016 operating profit. 
Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately a 4.5 percentage point headwind related to the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program. For those of you who are not familiar, we at IFF are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. From time to time, there are variations in incentive compensation as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plans. If we achieve our full-year financial targets, which are comprised of currency neutral sales growth, gross margin as a percentage of sales and absolute level of operating profit and working capital as a percentage of sales, we will receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we overperform or underperform our annual plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower, respectively. 
Since in 2015, we underperformed on a few components of our plan, our payout was below 100%. Now as we reset our targets in 2016, we budget for 100% payout, which ultimately is the driver behind the year-over-year variance. 
In the third bar, we've identified the incremental investments we are making in Vision 2020. These are critical strategic investments. For example, R&D, application and commercial, geared toward delivering our long-term strategic and financial objectives. As we communicated on our Investor Day, we committed to self fund our reinvestment opportunities. 
In the fourth bar, you can see that we are aggressively attacking our cost base to not only cover our incremental investments but also help to deliver on our short-term profitability objectives. In addition to our standard course of productivity initiatives, which includes the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies, we identified incremental savings opportunities via our Fund the Journey program. During the fourth quarter, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve our global manufacturing and operations network. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately $8 million to cover severance and related costs associated with expected termination, a portion of which are subject to consultation processes. 
The company expects to realize pretax savings of $7 million to $9 million when fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016, which is included in our 2016 guidance. 
Separately, the company recorded a charge of approximately $7 million associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the Aromor acquisition that was triggered by certain of the affected positions noted above. Then, the combination of our operational performance, inclusive of M&A, is expected to deliver 4% to 7% currency neutral operating profit growth. 
We expect foreign exchange, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment, will have a 5 percentage point impact, bringing our reported operating profit to be flat to up 2% in 2016. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide some additional insight into our foreign exchange exposure. Although 51% of our sales are to the emerging markets, not all of these sales are denominated in local currencies. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies and we have to price in local emerging market currencies.
As you can see in this chart, of the 51% of our sales in 2015 that were to emerging markets, approximately 70% were denominated in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, leaving only 30% that are denominated in emerging market currencies. As a result, our foreign exchange exposure to emerging markets currencies is rather limited. This is important, especially as we continue to see the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most emerging market currencies. 
Given that fact, it's clear that the key hard currencies have the most impact on our profitability. Starting with the top box, we looked at our profitability exposure. As we progress into 2016, while the Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Thai baht and Australian dollar are presenting modest headwinds in terms of currency, the euro is clearly the largest driver. As you can see, the devaluation of the euro versus U.S. dollar is expected to represent approximately 4 out of our 5 percentage point headwind in 2016. While we are hedged approximately 75% at 1.14% in 2016, the impact on profitability is about 2.5 percentage points plus the year-over-year variance of the hedging benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
To allow you to more accurately forecast the exchange rate volatility, I've included our 2015 exchange rate as well as our planning rate for 2016. We hope that by giving you these details, you have greater visibility into our currency exposure as you can calculate the percentage change in each specific currency and the multiple -- then multiply by the percentage of profit each currency represents. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some concluding remarks."

We have good pipeline, project pipeline, particularly on the Fragrance Compounds side and also on the Flavors side, so we see that this is good and very, very solid in Compounds. Fragrance, I would see it's even over the average we have seen before. So that's good. On the Flavors side, we see that projects are happening and we have projects that's not always executed by our customers and it depends how, let's say, how much they are selling them of the product, especially on the category side. On the geographic side, what we see is U.S. and Europe are actually pretty okay and coming back. We see a bit of a softness, in particular, in some of the emerging markets like China. And we should not forget that if we look at our customers, in particular the big CPG customers, that the outlook for volume is relatively muted. The good thing is we don't see this with all of our regional and local customers. And as you know, our customer split is 50-50, with the big clients and the small ones. So a bit of a long-winded answer. But there are really different pieces to be looked at for 2016. I hope it helps."

We have made the decision that we are -- we'll invest in the second plant. We plan to start groundbreaking at the end of the year and that will deliver us with, let's say, a backup plan for China for a market where we still believe we have to be present with a second plant for the volume. So that's actually on track. On our existing Flavors plant, we had -- earlier last year, we had the odor issue and we have solved it so far on the Flavors side. So that's working. We are back with our manufacturing, but having said all that, that has cost us some business over the course of 2015. Coming back to your first question. What we see is a deceleration of order patterns with our global customers, and that's something which is certainly impacting the business. It depends, certainly, customer by customer and region by region, so we really have to go into more of a detail. But still, for the smaller regional and local customers, it's the -- I would say, the assessment states that you'll have a couple of companies which have faster growth here. And that's actually good for us because we do significant business with these customers as well. I hope that helps."

But in talking to them, we've tried to quantify the difference and it seems like they're doing a lot better than you, even on a 2-year stacked basis in various sort of geographies and categories. And I'm particularly interested in China because they have been talking up China and telling investors that China's coming back and they're doing a lot better with the local regional players.

We see a deceleration of orders and we think that certainly had to do with our odor abatement issues that we experienced. But beyond that, our current pipeline is lower from a new brief perspective because we believe our clients are concerned a bit about not having a backup site in China and looked for alternative suppliers in the short term. We believe once we rectify that issue, there will be no issue from a volume perspective. So beyond that, I wanted to add to Andreas' comment about keep it on and FX. Because the way that our clients or our competitors measure, they actually take the benefit of pricing in terms of their growth rate, and so it's not nearly an apples-to-apples comparison as reported. And so you need to essentially stack the results down by maybe 1/3 to have an apples-to-apples comparison. And if you take -- if you do that, you'll see on a full-year basis, we're in fact performing better than our competition. The other distinction I wanted to make was when commenting in terms of China and share and briefs, the comment is in particular to Flavors and not Fragrance because we are growing in the Fragrance space in China."

I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison",1355,"Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. And I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash returned to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2016 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. 
Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the full-year 2015. I'm pleased to report that currency neutral sales grew 5%, which encompasses 6% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Overall, top line growth benefited from a 2 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. In addition, our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency neutral base, continued to benefit from strong new win performance, particularly in Fragrance Compounds, as sales related to new wins finished above our 5-year average. 
For the full-year 2015 and on a currency neutral basis, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 8% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 50 basis points as a result of our sales growth, the benefit associated with cost savings and productivity initiatives, mixed gains related to acquisitions and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement in operating profit, when combined with a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding, led to a 11% increase in our currency neutral adjusted EPS in 2015. 
While I'm pleased with our results on a full-year base, I'm not satisfied with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. That is driven by a combination of a challenging year-over-year comparison due to an additional week of sales, or the 53rd week in 2014, a concentrated effort by some of our larger customers to manage inventories in advance of year-end, the portfolio rationalization of one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers and an increased economic pressure in key emerging markets such as China. 
We did not perform as well as we would have expected. Alison will go through the specifics in greater detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to highlight the strategic progress we have made as it relates to our Vision 2020 strategy. 
Since the communication of our strategy in June 2, 2015, we have taken steps to deliver on our ambition to achieve target market leadership, defined by #1 or #2 market share positions in key markets, capital risk and customers. Within the emerging markets, we've identified the Middle East and Africa as an area of focus, given the robust economic trends and the impact on our consumer disposable income in the future. I'm happy to report, even as we are very early in our journey, that for the full year, Middle East and Africa were up 14% on a currency neutral basis. 
Similarly, with Fragrance Compounds, China grew high single digits as the local teams continue to leverage our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge to win both global and regional customers. 
Consumer Fragrances continued its mid- to high single-digit growth trend in 2015. And within that segment, Home Care, an area of focus for us, grew high single digits for the full year on a currency neutral basis, led by a double-digit growth in Latin America. 
In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 16% currency neutral sales growth, driven in part by key customers and our proprietary delivery systems. In 2015, in North America, we believe we are now the #2 flavors company with our acquisition of Ottens Flavors, which will be adding approximately $60 million in annual sales to our business. 
Over the course of the year, we also made strong progress against our innovating first pillar, as we believe our robust technology pipeline is critical to building greater differentiation and ultimately, accelerated growth. In quarter 4, we commercialized 2 additional capital Fragrance Ingredients molecules, bringing our total output to 4 in 2015. In addition, the cost of fruit and crystal fizz, which I spoke about last quarter, in quarter 4, we commercialized Amber Tonic [ph] and Cool Wood [ph], both molecules are strong performers in all applications and give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance for our customers. 
We are proud of these accomplishments as we set up annual fragrance ingredients molecule output average. We believe this is very critical in terms of differentiation and it provides us with greater confidence in our growth and visions going forward. 
The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the fourth quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery system in Flavors. The growth trend of encapsulation-related sales continued in 2015 as currency neutral sales improved mid-teens led by Fabric Care and Home Care. 
For the full-year 2015, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis, with all geographic markets posting strong growth, led by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. Leveraging our success in Fabric Care, we developed a new capsule in 2015, which will allow us to extend this critical encapsulation technology into Personal Care categories such as Hair Care and Body Wash. 
Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to produce strong results, increasing double digits in 2015. The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of consumers while primarily looking to reduce sugar and salt. 
Building on the strengths, we also commercialized 2 natural taste modulators in 2015. The addition of these modulators will further strengthen our capabilities and it provides our flavors a more competitive palate from which we've built winning solutions for our customers. 
In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we've also made a progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. In December, we launched our refreshed branding where we unveiled the new website, service statement, visual identity and tone of voice, all of which are geared towards showcasing IFF's vision, imagination and innovative focus to customers, employees and, of course, shareholders. 
I'm proud of the recognition we have received from our customers in 2015. Over the course of the year, we won the North America Innovation Award as one of the largest flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estée Lauder presented us with their Suppliers Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners. Also, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, who we acquired in August, won the 2015, in Cosmetics Asia, Gold Award for best active ingredient innovation and best functional ingredient. More recently, they also received first prize of the first Cosmetic Ingredients Show of 2016. 
When it comes to sustainability, at IFF, we will not accept the status quo. We believe this is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, which is why we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture. As you can see on this slide, 2015 was a very successful year in terms of accomplishment. 
While the first 3 pillars focus on leveraging or improving our existing capabilities and infrastructure, the fourth pillar strengthening and extending the portfolio aims to support our organic business through M&A partnerships and collaborations. 
During the second and third quarter 2015, we completed 2 acquisitions: one focusing on growing our market share in North America; and one focusing on expanding into new adjacencies which have strategic value. Both acquisitions in 2015 have performed well and are ahead of our business case in terms of sales growth and margin enhancement. We believe that performance is a good indication that we're allocating capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made from a strategic perspective, and I'm committed to continuing this momentum as we move through 2016. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."
281407,322383351,932549,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas. Given the softness that we experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency",912,"Thank you, Andreas. Given the softness that we experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what was communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter, with organic sales flat to down slightly in Q4. At that time, as shown in the chart, currency neutral sales on an organic basis was up 2% in October. As we move to November, our growth trajectory continued, with currency neutral sales up nearly 3% for the month. Then, unfortunately, our performance in December came in softer than we expected. While we knew we faced a strong year ago comparison that included an extra week of sales, which we quantified to be 200 basis points in the quarter or approximately 600 basis points in the month of December, there were a few other factors that further pressured results. 
First, in Flavors, we experienced unprecedented fluctuations in terms of customer order patterns. While traditionally, we have good visibility around the commercialization of products and our customers' recurring order patterns, we ultimately are dependent on our customers in terms of launches and inventory levels. In December, we unexpectedly experienced several large Flavors customers reducing their overall order intake, which impacted results. This was also the case in Consumer Fragrances, where customers did not reorder at the same level as they did in the year-ago period, excluding the 53rd-week impact. 
In Fragrances, our Ingredients business remained under pressure, as one of our largest Fragrance Ingredients customers continued to rationalize their product portfolio. In Q4, the impact was even more pronounced, which further pressured results.
And lastly, we continue to see pressure in Flavors in China, partly due to a weaker economic environment but also some lost business relating to the manufacturing issues we faced earlier in the year. 
In light of our challenging currency neutral sales growth, we still manage to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. In the quarter, acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to overall growth. 
There are 2 areas that I want to highlight in terms of our top line in the quarter. The first is Latin America Flavors, where we continue to benefit from our industry-leading delivery system technology and take market share from our competition. Also in Latin America, Fine Fragrance has returned to growth in the fourth quarter as volume erosion appears to be normalizing and we continue to win new business as we significantly outperform the market. 
From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis increased 3% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion, the benefits of productivity initiatives, M&A and reduced incentive compensation drove results. Below the line, currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 9%, thanks in large part to a lower adjusted effective tax rate, down 210 basis points and an 830,000 share reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Despite the softer-than-expected sales and operating profit performance in Q4, we still delivered a solid financial performance on a full-year basis. Currency neutral sales improved 5%, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 8% and currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as the percentage of sales as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q4 was down 40 basis points, to approximately 28.7% of our 2015 annual sales. 
Much of our gains came from higher payables as a result of the concentrated efforts to improve our days payables outstanding. On a full-year basis, our DPO increased by 9 days to 54 days, from 45 days a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the fourth quarter was $434 million, including an incremental $24 million pension contribution. Excluding the incremental portion of the pension contribution, adjusted operating cash flow would have increased to $458 million or 15.2% of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $101 million or approximately 3.3% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finished our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. 
CapEx in 2015 came in below original expectations as the timing of several vendor payments will now occur in 2016. As a result, we expect 2016 CapEx will increase to around 5% of sales as we plan to make incremental investments for manufacturing in a new Flavors site in China and to improve our site in India. 
For cash return to shareholders, dividend payments in 2015 were $160 million. This is a direct result of a 20% increase in August as our intention was to provide a more competitive yield, approximately 2%, while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend and remaining flexible to pursue M&A opportunities, we spent $122 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we've repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding to 80.4 million shares. When combining both dividends and share repurchases, we achieved a 66% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our targeted range of 50% to 60% and significantly ahead of prior year. Looking ahead to 2016, we can reiterate our targeted total payout ratio range of 50% to 60%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas."

As we look ahead to 2016, I want to provide an assessment of our vantage point as we stand here today. Basically, there are 4 key themes that we believe are relevant when planning our financial goals for 2016. 
From an economic perspective, there's a lot of fluidity around the world. While the developed markets of the U.S. and Western Europe appear to be improving slowly, in the emerging markets, the volatility we experienced in the second half of 2015 continues. Large markets like China appear to be decelerating and Brazil continues to decline. These 2 markets account for approximately 15% of our total sales. 
With regard to multinational consumer product companies, volume expectations seem to be muted as many organizations appear to be focused on improving margins while taking pricing actions in emerging markets to protect profitability. Fortunately, regional players continue to exhibit stronger volume trends, whether it be in the U.S. or in the emerging markets. This economic uncertainty has led to sharp declines in hard commodities such as oil, which is beneficial in terms of cost. This large decline in petrochemical should help in terms of input cost, although we continue to see naturals such as vanilla and citrus remaining elevated. 
Finally, in terms of foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against world currencies. This continues to be a challenge for most multinational companies based in the U.S., both in terms of translation and transaction exposure. 
With all that as context, we are preparing ourselves for even more challenging conditions given the higher level of economic uncertainty and the more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. We expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5 percentage point contribution on the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to be largely driven by Consumer Fragrances as well as Latin America and EAME and Flavors. 
From an operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of the contribution of M&A. This improvement should be a result of gross margin expansion and productivity initiatives that more than offset the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program and investments in our strategy 2020. Both of which, Alison will touch on in a moment. 
Currency neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Longer term, we continue to believe that over the 2016, 2020 horizon, we can deliver our Vision 2020 financial targets. We believe our emphasis on building greater differentiation, specifically in R&D, should ultimately lead to higher growth rates in the years to come. 
And in light of the recent instability in the financial markets around the world, I want to take a moment to reemphasize that IFF is a diversified and competitively advantaged organization. Whether you analyze our portfolio by category, region or customer, the breadth and diversity of our portfolio is great and our innovative solutions are key components of consumer staple products that enjoy long-term growth stability. We believe that our management team, as well as all IFF employees, are capable of executing on our strategy 2020 to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that we can deliver organic currency neutral growth term targets of 4% to 6% growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth over the course of '16 to 2020. 
With that, I would like to ask Alison to provide some additional remarks on our profitability outlook and foreign exchange exposure."
281407,322383351,932549,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Given the many moving parts, I wanted to provide additional insights and transparency into our expected profitability goal for 2016.

In the table, we anchored on full-year 2015 adjusted operating profit and built out a reconciliation to bridge the 2016 operating profit. 
Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately a 4.5 percentage point headwind related to the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program. For those of you who are not familiar, we at IFF are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. From time to time, there are variations in incentive compensation as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plans. If we achieve our full-year financial targets, which are comprised of currency neutral sales growth, gross margin as a percentage of sales and absolute level of operating profit and working capital as a percentage of sales, we will receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we overperform or underperform our annual plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower, respectively. 
Since in 2015, we underperformed on a few components of our plan, our payout was below 100%. Now as we reset our targets in 2016, we budget for 100% payout, which ultimately is the driver behind the year-over-year variance. 
In the third bar, we've identified the incremental investments we are making in Vision 2020. These are critical strategic investments. For example, R&D, application and commercial, geared toward delivering our long-term strategic and financial objectives. As we communicated on our Investor Day, we committed to self-fund our reinvestment opportunities. 
In the fourth bar, you can see that we are aggressively attacking our cost base to not only cover our incremental investments but also help to deliver on our short-term profitability objectives. In addition to our standard course of productivity initiatives, which includes the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies, we identified incremental savings opportunities via our Fund the Journey program. During the fourth quarter, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve our global manufacturing and operations network. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately $8 million to cover severance and related costs associated with expected termination, a portion of which are subject to consultation processes. 
The company expects to realize pretax savings of $7 million to $9 million when fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016, which is included in our 2016 guidance. 
Separately, the company recorded a charge of approximately $7 million associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the Aromor acquisition that was triggered by certain of the affected positions noted above. Then, the combination of our operational performance, inclusive of M&A, is expected to deliver 4% to 7% currency neutral operating profit growth. 
We expect foreign exchange, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment, will have a 5 percentage point impact, bringing our reported operating profit to be flat to up 2% in 2016. 
Before concluding, I would like to provide some additional insight into our foreign exchange exposure. Although 51% of our sales are to the emerging markets, not all of these sales are denominated in local currencies. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies and we have to price in local emerging market currencies.
As you can see in this chart, of the 51% of our sales in 2015 that were to emerging markets, approximately 70% were denominated in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, leaving only 30% that are denominated in emerging market currencies. As a result, our foreign exchange exposure to emerging markets currencies is rather limited. This is important, especially as we continue to see the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most emerging market currencies. 
Given that fact, it's clear that the key hard currencies have the most impact on our profitability. Starting with the top box, we looked at our profitability exposure. As we progress into 2016, while the Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Thai baht and Australian dollar are presenting modest headwinds in terms of currency, the euro is clearly the largest driver. As you can see, the devaluation of the euro versus U.S. dollar is expected to represent approximately 4 out of our 5 percentage point headwind in 2016. While we are hedged approximately 75% at 1.14% in 2016, the impact on profitability is about 2.5 percentage points plus the year-over-year variance of the hedging benefit in 2016 versus 2015. 
To allow you to more accurately forecast the exchange rate volatility, I've included our 2015 exchange rate as well as our planning rate for 2016. We hope that by giving you these details, you have greater visibility into our currency exposure as you can calculate the percentage change in each specific currency and the multiple -- then multiply by the percentage of profit each currency represents. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some concluding remarks."

We have good pipeline, project pipeline, particularly on the Fragrance Compounds side and also on the Flavors side, so we see that this is good and very, very solid in Compounds. Fragrance, I would see it's even over the average we have seen before. So that's good. On the Flavors side, we see that projects are happening and we have projects that's not always executed by our customers and it depends how, let's say, how much they are selling them of the product, especially on the category side. On the geographic side, what we see is U.S. and Europe are actually pretty okay and coming back. We see a bit of a softness, in particular, in some of the emerging markets like China. And we should not forget that if we look at our customers, in particular the big CPG customers, that the outlook for volume is relatively muted. The good thing is we don't see this with all of our regional and local customers. And as you know, our customer split is 50-50, with the big clients and the small ones. So a bit of a long-winded answer. But there are really different pieces to be looked at for 2016. I hope it helps."

So I'm wondering if you're also seeing end market demand flow for those regional and local customers that the macro is now trickling into total market demand, not just a bit of the share shift that you'd seen happening. So that was my first question. The second was on the decision to invest in the new China Flavors facility. How does it tie into the existing manufacturing plant -- I guess there's 2, but the one where you had kind of the emissions issues this summer. If you can just give us a little more color on that, it'd be great."

So that's actually on track. On our existing Flavors plant, we had -- earlier last year, we had the odor issue and we have solved it so far on the Flavors side. So that's working. We are back with our manufacturing, but having said all that, that has cost us some business over the course of 2015. Coming back to your first question. What we see is a deceleration of order patterns with our global customers, and that's something which is certainly impacting the business. It depends, certainly, customer by customer and region by region, so we really have to go into more of a detail. But still, for the smaller regional and local customers, it's the -- I would say, the assessment states that you'll have a couple of companies which have faster growth here.

But in talking to them, we've tried to quantify the difference and it seems like they're doing a lot better than you, even on a 2-year stacked basis in various sort of geographies and categories. And I'm particularly interested in China because they have been talking up China and telling investors that China's coming back and they're doing a lot better with the local regional players.

We see a deceleration of orders and we think that certainly had to do with our odor abatement issues that we experienced. But beyond that, our current pipeline is lower from a new brief perspective because we believe our clients are concerned a bit about not having a backup site in China and looked for alternative suppliers in the short term. We believe once we rectify that issue, there will be no issue from a volume perspective. So beyond that, I wanted to add to Andreas' comment about keep it on and FX. Because the way that our clients or our competitors measure, they actually take the benefit of pricing in terms of their growth rate, and so it's not nearly an apples-to-apples comparison as reported. And so you need to essentially stack the results down by maybe 1/3 to have an apples-to-apples comparison. And if you take -- if you do that, you'll see on a full-year basis, we're in fact performing better than our competition. The other distinction I wanted to make was when commenting in terms of China and share and briefs, the comment is in particular to Flavors and not Fragrance because we are growing in the Fragrance space in China."

Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we'll finish by taking any questions that you may have.
I'm pleased with how we started 2016. Given the volatile global operating environment and against our strong year-ago growth comparison, currency neutral sales was 6%, which was comprised of 5% growth in Flavors and 8% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 4 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent activations of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.  Our organic business, which had stronger performance than we anticipated, grew 2% on currency neutral basis. The driver of our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends as what we have experienced in the fourth quarter 2015. In addition, we also benefited from an increased contribution of commercial performance as new win growth was strong, particularly in Fragrance Compounds.
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business while simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 20 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. The driver of our profit improvement was strong growth profit performance, driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits of productivity initiatives and contribution of acquisitions. Currency neutral EPS improved 11% as we gained additional leverage from a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction in shares outstanding.
With respect to Vision 2020, we continue to make progress each quarter. Differentiations through innovation is crucial to our success. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that one of our key R&D focus areas, delivery systems, continued to be a growth driver in the first quarter. In Fragrances, the strong trends from encapsulation-related sales continued as currency neutral sales improved high single digit, led by Fabric Care and Toiletries. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis with all geographies posting strong growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in EMEA and Greater Asia.
In Flavors, another key focus area for us is modulation as our sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to post strong growth, improving strong double digits on a currency neutral basis led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand for healthier and better-for-you products.  In the first quarter, we also commercialized 2 new flavor molecules and one no natural sweetness modulator to give all Flavors more novel technologies to build winning solutions for our customers.
We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership positions. In North America, we saw 11% currency neutral increase for the first quarter 2016, driven by our recent acquisitions and strong growth in Fragrances. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved mid-single digits and Fine Fragrance grew double digits, led by strong new win performance. 
Leveraging our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, we are focused on the Middle East and Africa as a growth driver. In the first quarter, we achieved strong growth across both Flavors and Fragrances to deliver a double-digit improvement on a currency neutral basis.
The mid- to high single-digit growth trends we have seen in recent years in Consumer Fragrances continued into the first quarter of 2016. Within that segment, Home Care, a strategic area of focus for us, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 8% currency neutral sales growth or 14% on a 2-year average basis. Based on our continued success, leveraging innovation was key customers. [ph] 
We continue to position ourselves to be a customer's partner of choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter, IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won a Silver Innovation award at the In-Cosmetics Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl. For those of you who have not had a chance to experience this product, Miniporyl is an active ingredient, which is extracted from a red clover flower and is a natural pore minimizer designed to rebalance skin conditions responsible for pore enlargement. 
Because of our continued commitment to sustainability and focus on weaving it into all aspects of our business and corporate culture, we were rated gold and ranked a top supplier by EcoVadis. EcoVadis aims at improving social practices of companies by leveraging the influence of global supply chains. 
During quarter 1, we also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which is an organization of forward-thinking companies that stimulate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. We are excited to be part of an organization that works together across sectors, geographies and value chains to explore, develop and scale up business solutions to address the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm happy to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetic achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors posted solid growth for the quarter on a stand-alone basis, led by regional customers. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities.
Let me conclude by saying how pleased we are with the strategic progress we have made so far this year. We look forward to building on this momentum as we progress to the balance of the year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

I would also like to take an opportunity to provide commentary on our adjusted EBITDA, given M&A has become a larger component of our strategy and is a key indicator of comparison to our largest competitors. We continue to see profitability and margin progression as our adjusted EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year period, exclusive of currency.  Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a very strong 120 basis points, principally driven by volume leverage, the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives and mix benefit resulting from the inclusion of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and IFF Ottens Flavors.
Turning to business unit performance, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 4%, primarily driven by approximately 4 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. It is important to know that this growth was on top of strong 9% currency neutral growth in the first quarter of 2015. The improvements was led by high single-digit increases in North America, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and Latin America, reflecting double-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Dairy. [indiscernible] posted low single-digit growth as increases in India and Thailand where more than offset by softness in China, although trends in China improved sequentially. 
Within Greater Asia and on a category perspective, growth was driven by new win performance, particularly with relative strength in Dairy and Sweet. Europe, Africa and the Middle East decreased 1% against 9% growth from the comparable year-ago period as softness and Western Europe more than offset a strong high single-digit improvement in the Middle East and Africa. 
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 1%, primarily resulting from the contribution of IFF on Flavors and strong benefits from productivity initiatives.  Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 4 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, with all regions posting growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high-single-digit growth in Latin America. 
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 7% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins, led by North America which achieved a strong double-digit growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and low single digit growth in Latin America. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% with broad-based growth across all categories. Technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and personnel contributed high single-digit increases. 
Within Consumer Fragrances on a geographic basis, all regions delivered growth, led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and a mid-single-digit increase in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Ingredients sales were up 15%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our base Fragrance Ingredients business which, as a reminder, are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remained soft, reflecting continued challenging market conditions as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by our mid-single-digit Fragrance Compounds growth.
From a profit perspective, license currency neutral segment profit was very strong, growing about 15% year-over-year, driven by robust volume growth, the benefits in cost and productivity initiatives and more favorable mix. This performance led to over 130 basis point improvement in currency neutral operating profit margin.
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million compared with $31 million the prior year period. Our core working capital levels were challenged, principally driven by the timing of payables. We expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016. 
From a capital structure standpoint, we spent approximately $23 million in expenditures and continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As noted in our year-end call, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia, primarily related to a new flavors manufacturing plant in China, which was disclosed on our Q4 conference call, and investments in technology expansions.
With regard to China, I'd like to provide some additional commentary as it relates to our fragrance ingredients plant. We as well as other chemical plants in the same industrial zone received a request from the Chinese government to relocate our fragrance ingredients plant in [indiscernible]. Currently, we are in discussions with the government regarding the intent, purpose and timing of the request a relocation. If we are ultimately required to move, our company and government authorities would need to agree upon the amount and nature of government compensation, including adequate timing and financial support. This is similar to a move required a few years ago when we worked in partnership with the Chinese government to relocate one of our fragrance ingredients plants from one industrial park to another over an extended period with minimal business impact.  Please note that the relocation request is an evolving situation. We will continue to keep you updated.
Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in Q1, we spent approximately $45 million on dividend payouts and $40 million on share repurchases. Given these levels and our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to meet our total payout ratio objectives of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.
Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. While there are some indications that the global environment has marginally improved, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic with respect to achieving our previously stated financial guidance for 2016, given the persistent volatility in the market. As it is still early in the year, and we believe that the first quarter 2016 partially benefited from timing of orders from Q4 of 2015 to Q1 of 2016, we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate results.
In the second quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that we are comparing to a low effective tax rate in the prior year period when we benefited from the timing of an R&D tax credit. That benefit is not expected to repeat itself again this year. 
As a reminder, for the full year 2016, we expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point of contribution from the acquisitions of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A.  Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation the our share repurchase program.
Given the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I would also like to address the impact of currency on our financial results. While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our guidance to reflect the movement of the U.S. dollar to other world currencies since the beginning of the year. As I have discussed in the past, the euro is clearly the largest driver in terms of our currency basket, representing approximately 35% of our profit exposure. Previously, we expected that the valuation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar to represent approximately 4 out of our original 5 percentage point headwind to profit in 2016. Now given the euro-USD exchange rate in Q1, the fact that we are hedged approximately 75% at $1.14 in 2016 and assuming a spot rate of $1.13, we expect about a 3 percentage point impact from the euro as our expected weighted average exchange rate for 2016 is $1.35 [ph] versus our average rate of $1.25 for 2015. The rest of the currencies within our basket have improved versus our original guidance and now are expected to effectively offset one another on a profitability basis. As such, we expect currency to have a 2 percentage point impact on sales versus 2.5 previously assumed. We expect a 3 percentage point impact on operating profit and EPS should current rates remain constant for the balance of the year.
The increased volatility and duration of a currency movement continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. We measure the impact of currency on various fronts, including translation and transaction impact as well as timing effects associated with our supply chain and inventory movements. We recognize that there are potentially different approaches that can be used to measure this impact. And as the methodology differs among our industry and peer groups, we regularly review our methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight to our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how the business is around or information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are in the process of our current review, we believe if we were to adopt a different methodology, it would likely have a positive impact on our currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth in 2016.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

And unfortunately, we believe that the global environment is still pretty volatile and choppy, as you were saying. Because we see in some areas of the world, we see actually very good growth trends. We just came back, Alison, myself, from Middle East and Africa. We see good double-digit growth in the region despite the political unrest. We have other areas, for example, in China where we're seeing basically a slowdown in growth. So you see from the geographic point of view, it's very volatile at the moment. And even in the U.S., it's not super consistent with we're seeing. On top of it, we see differences in between the different categories. Let me give you an example. If you look for example to modulation or sweetness modulation, that's something which is certainly facilitating our growth because we see more countries moving in towards sugar tax. U.K. just did it. South Africa's on the brink to do it. that's something which is driving growth in the category. But in other categories, we don't see as much growth because it goes against it. So it's a very complex picture, and that's the reason why we say we have to deal with that kind of volatility around the globe. So we believe that the market probably has a growth for Flavors and Fragrances between 2% and maybe 3%, but that's very much on the high end. On the active cosmetics, we still see higher growth trends between, let's say, 5% and 6%. So it's a pretty difficult picture at the moment."

Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we'll finish by taking any questions that you may have.
I'm pleased with how we started 2016. Given the volatile global operating environment and against our strong year-ago growth comparison, currency neutral sales were 6%, which was comprised of 5% growth in Flavors and 8% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 4 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent activations of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.
Our organic business, which had stronger performance than we anticipated, grew 2% on currency neutral basis. The driver of our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends versus what we have experienced in the fourth quarter 2015. In addition, we also benefited from an increased contribution of commercial performance as new win growth was strong, particularly in Fragrance Compounds.
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business while simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 20 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. The driver of our profit improvement was strong gross profit performance, driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits of productivity initiatives and contribution of acquisitions. Currency neutral EPS improved 11% as we gained additional leverage from a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction in shares outstanding.
With respect to Vision 2020, we continue to make progress each quarter. Differentiations through innovation is crucial to our success. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that one of our key R&D focus areas, delivery systems, continued to be a growth driver in the first quarter. In Fragrances, the strong trends from encapsulation-related sales continued as currency neutral sales improved high single digit, led by Fabric Care and Toiletries. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis with all geographies posting strong growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in EMEA and Greater Asia.
In Flavors, another key focus area for us is modulation as sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to post strong growth, improving strong double digits on a currency neutral basis led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand for healthier and better-for-you products. In the first quarter, we also commercialized 2 new flavor molecules and one new natural sweetness modulator to give our flavors more novel technologies to build winning solutions for our customers.
We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership positions. In North America, we saw 11% currency neutral increase for the first quarter of 2016, driven by our recent acquisitions and strong growth in Fragrances. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved mid-single digits and Fine Fragrance grew double digits, led by strong new win performance. Leveraging our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, we are focused on the Middle East and Africa as a growth driver. In the first quarter, we achieved strong growth across both Flavors and Fragrances to deliver a double-digit improvement on a currency neutral basis.
The mid to high single-digit growth trends we have seen in recent years in Consumer Fragrances continued into the first quarter of 2016. Within that segment, Home Care, a strategic area of focus for us, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 8% currency neutral sales growth or 14% on a 2-year average basis. Based on our continued success, leveraging innovation was key customers.
We continue to position ourselves to be a customer's partner of choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter, IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won a Silver Innovation award at the in-cosmetics Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl. For those of you who have not had a chance to experience this product, Miniporyl is an active ingredient, which is extracted from a red clover flower and is a natural pore minimizer designed to rebalance skin conditions responsible for pore enlargement. Because of our continued commitment to sustainability and focus on weaving it into all aspects of our business and corporate culture, we were rated Gold and ranked a top supplier by EcoVadis. EcoVadis aims at improving environmental and social practices of companies by leveraging the influence of global supply chains.
During quarter 1, we also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which is an organization of forward-thinking companies that stimulate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. We are excited to be part of an organization that works together across sectors, geographies and value chains to explore, develop and scale up business solutions to address the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm happy to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors posted solid growth for the quarter on a stand-alone basis, led by regional customers. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities.
Let me conclude by saying how pleased we are with the strategic progress we have made so far this year. We look forward to building on this momentum as we progress to the balance of the year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

I would like to reiterate our strong financial performance for the first quarter. I am pleased that we were able to deliver sales growth of 6%, adjusted operating profit growth of 7% and adjusted EPS growth of 11%, all on a currency ne",1573,"Thank you, Andreas. I would like to reiterate our strong financial performance for the first quarter. I am pleased that we were able to deliver sales growth of 6%, adjusted operating profit growth of 7% and adjusted EPS growth of 11%, all on a currency neutral basis. Our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends, which we believe include the timing of orders from fourth quarter of 2015 to first quarter of 2016 and strong new win performance.
I would also like to take an opportunity to provide commentary on our adjusted EBITDA, given M&A has become a larger component of our strategy and is a key indicator of comparison to our largest competitors. We continue to seek profitability and margin progression as our adjusted EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year period, inclusive of currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a very strong 120 basis points, principally driven by volume leverage, the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives and mix benefit resulting from the inclusion of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and IFF Ottens Flavors.
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 4%, primarily driven by approximately 4 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. It is important to know that this growth was on top of strong 9% currency neutral growth in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was led by high single-digit increases in North America, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and Latin America, reflecting double-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Dairy. Greater Asia posted low single-digit growth as increases in India and Thailand were more than offset by softness in China, although trends in China improved sequentially.
Within Greater Asia and on a category perspective, growth was driven by new win performance, particularly with relative strength in Dairy and Sweet. Europe, Africa and the Middle East decreased 1% against 9% growth from the comparable year ago period as softness in Western Europe more than offset a strong high single-digit improvement in the Middle East and Africa.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 1%, primarily resulting from the contribution of IFF on Flavors and strong benefits from productivity initiatives. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 4 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, with all regions posting growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in Latin America.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 7% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins, led by North America, which achieved strong double-digit growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and low single digit growth in Latin America. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% with broad based growth across all categories. Technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and personnel loss contributed high single-digit increases.
Within Consumer Fragrances, on a geographic basis, all regions delivered growth, led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and a mid-single-digit increase in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredient sales were up 15%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our base Fragrance Ingredients business which, as a reminder, are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remained soft, reflecting continued challenging market conditions as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by our mid-single-digit Fragrance Compounds growth.
From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit was very strong, growing about 15% year-over-year, driven by robust volume growth, the benefits in cost and productivity initiatives and more favorable mix. This performance led to over 130 basis point improvement in currency neutral operating profit margin.
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million compared with $31 million the prior year period. Our core working capital levels were challenged, principally driven by the timing of payables. We expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.
From a capital structure standpoint, we spent approximately $23 million in expenditures and continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As noted on our year-end call, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia, primarily related to a new flavors manufacturing plant in China, which was disclosed on our Q4 conference call, and investments in technology expansions.
With regard to China, I'd like to provide some additional commentary as it relates to our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We, as well as other chemical plants in the same industrial zone, received a request from the Chinese government to relocate our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Zhejiang. Currently, we are in discussions with the government regarding the intent, purpose and timing of the request of relocation.
If we were ultimately required to move, our company and government authorities would need to agree upon the amount and nature of government compensation, including adequate timing and financial support. This is similar to a move required a few years ago when we worked in partnership with the Chinese government to relocate one of our Fragrance Ingredients plants from one industrial park to another over an extended period with minimal business impact. Please note that the relocation request is an evolving situation. We will continue to keep you updated.
Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in Q1, we spent approximately $45 million on dividend payouts and $40 million on share repurchases. Given these levels and our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to meet our total payout ratio objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.
Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. While there are some indications that the global environment has marginally improved, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic with respect to achieving our previously stated financial guidance for 2016 given the persistent volatility in the market. As it is still early in the year, and we believe that the first quarter 2016 partially benefited from timing of orders from Q4 of 2015 to Q1 of 2016, we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate results.
In the second quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that we are comparing to a low effective tax rate in the prior year period when we benefited from the timing of an R&D tax credit. That benefit is not expected to repeat itself again this year.
As a reminder, for the full year 2016, we expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point of contribution from the acquisitions of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.
Given the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I would also like to address the impact of currency on our financial results. While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our guidance to reflect the movement of the U.S. dollar to other world currencies since the beginning of the year. As I have discussed in the past, the euro is clearly the largest driver in terms of our currency basket, representing approximately 35% of our profit exposure.
Previously, we expected the devaluation of the euro versus the U.S. Dollar to represent approximately 4 out of our original 5 percentage point headwind to profit in 2016. Now given the euro-USD exchange rate in Q1, the fact that we are hedged approximately 75% at $1.14 in 2016 and assuming a spot rate of $1.13, we expect about a 3 percentage point impact from the euro as our expected weighted average exchange rate for 2016 is $1.35 versus our average rate of $1.25 for 2015.
The rest of the currencies within our basket have improved versus our original guidance and now are expected to effectively offset one another on a profitability basis. As such, we expect currency to have a 2 percentage point impact on sales versus 2.5 previously assumed. We expect a 3 percentage point impact on operating profit and EPS should current rates remain constant for the balance of the year.
The increased volatility and duration of a currency movement continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. We measure the impact of currency on various fronts, including translation and transaction impact as well as timing effects associated with our supply chain and inventory movements. We recognize that there are potentially different approaches that can be used to measure this impact.
And as the methodology differs amongst our industry and peer groups, we regularly review our methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight to our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how the business is run or information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are in the process of our current review, we believe that if we were to adopt a different methodology, it would likely have a positive impact on our currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth in 2016.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

And unfortunately, we believe that the global environment is still pretty volatile and choppy, as you were saying, because we see in some areas of the world, we see actually very good growth trends. We just came back, Alison, myself from Middle East and Africa. We see good double-digit growth in the region despite the political unrest. We have other areas, for example, in China where we're seeing basically a slowdown in growth. So you see from a geographic point of view, it's very volatile at the moment. And even in the U.S., it's not super consistent with what we're seeing. On top of it, we see differences in between the different categories. Let me give you an example. If you look, for example, to Modulation or Sweetness Modulation, That's something which is certainly facilitating our growth because we see more countries moving in towards sugar tax. The U.K. just did it. South Africa's on the brink to do it. So that's something which is driving growth in the category. But in other categories, we don't see as much growth because it goes against it. So it's a very complex picture, and that's the reason why we say we have to deal with that kind of volatility around the globe. So we believe that the market probably has a growth for Flavors and Fragrances between 2% and maybe 3%, but that's very much on the high end. On the active cosmetics, we still see much higher growth trends between, let's say, 5% and 6%. So it's a pretty difficult picture at the moment."

I'm pleased with how we started 2016. Given the volatile global operating environment and against our strong year-ago growth comparison, currency neutral sales were 6%, which was comprised of 5% growth in Flavors and 8% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 4 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent activations of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics.
Our organic business, which had stronger performance than we anticipated, grew 2% on currency neutral basis. The driver of our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends versus what we have experienced in the fourth quarter 2015. In addition, we also benefited from an increased contribution of commercial performance as new win growth was strong, particularly in Fragrance Compounds.
 
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business while simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 20 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. The driver of our profit improvement was strong gross profit performance, driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits of productivity initiatives and contribution of acquisitions. Currency-neutral EPS improved 11% as we gained additional leverage from a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction in shares outstanding.
 
With respect to Vision 2020, we continue to make progress each quarter. Differentiations through innovation is crucial to our success. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that one of our key R&D focus areas, delivery systems, continued to be a growth driver in the first quarter. In Fragrances, the strong trends from encapsulation-related sales continued as currency neutral sales improved high single digit, led by Fabric Care and Toiletries. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew high single digits on a currency neutral basis with all geographies posting strong growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in EMEA and Greater Asia.
In Flavors, another key focus area for us is modulation as sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued to post strong growth, improving strong double digits on a currency neutral basis led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand for healthier and better-for-you products. In the first quarter, we also commercialized 2 new flavor molecules and one new natural sweetness modulator to give our flavors more novel technologies to build winning solutions for our customers.
 
 We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership positions. In North America, we saw 11% currency neutral increase for the first quarter of 2016, driven by our recent acquisitions and strong growth in Fragrances. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved mid-single digits and Fine Fragrance grew double digits, led by strong new win performance. Leveraging our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, we are focused on the Middle East and Africa as a growth driver. In the first quarter, we achieved strong growth across both Flavors and Fragrances to deliver a double-digit improvement on a currency neutral basis.
 
The mid to high single-digit growth trends we have seen in recent years in Consumer Fragrances continued into the first quarter of 2016. Within that segment, Home Care, a strategic area of focus for us, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 8% currency neutral sales growth or 14% on a 2-year average basis. Based on our continued success leveraging innovation with key customers.
We continue to position ourselves to be a customer's partner of choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter, IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won a Silver Innovation award at the in-cosmetics Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl. For those of you who have not had a chance to experience this product, Miniporyl is an active ingredient which is extracted from a red clover flower and is a natural pore minimizer designed to rebalance skin conditions responsible for pore enlargement. Because of our continued commitment to sustainability and focus on weaving it into all aspects of our business and corporate culture, we were rated Gold and ranked a top supplier by EcoVadis. EcoVadis aims at improving environmental and social practices of companies by leveraging the influence of global supply chains.
During quarter 1, we also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which is an organization of forward-thinking companies that stimulate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. We are excited to be part of an organization that works together across sectors, geographies and value chains to explore, develop and scale up business solutions to address the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm happy to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors posted solid growth for the quarter on a stand-alone basis, led by regional customers. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities.
Let me conclude by saying how pleased we are with the strategic progress we have made so far this year. We look forward to building on this momentum as we progress to the balance of the year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

I would like to reiterate our strong financial performance for the first quarter. I am pleased that we were able to deliver sales growth of 6%, adjusted operating profit growth of 7% and adjusted EPS growth of 11%, all on a currency-neutral basis. Our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends, which we believe include the timing of orders from fourth quarter of 2015 to first quarter of 2016 and strong new win performance.
I would also like to take an opportunity to provide commentary on our adjusted EBITDA, given M&A has become a larger component of our strategy and is a key indicator of comparison to our largest competitors. We continue to see profitability and margin progression as our adjusted EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year period, inclusive of currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a very strong 120 basis points, principally driven by volume leverage, the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives and mix benefits resulting from the inclusion of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and IFF Ottens Flavors.
 
Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 4%, primarily driven by approximately 4 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. It is important to know that this growth was on top of strong 9% currency-neutral growth in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was led by high single-digit increases in North America, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors, and Latin America, reflecting double-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Dairy. Greater Asia posted low single-digit growth as increases in India and Thailand were more than offset by softness in China, although trends in China improved sequentially.
 
Within Greater Asia and on a category perspective, growth was driven by new win performance, particularly with relative strength in Dairy and Sweet. Europe, Africa and the Middle East decreased 1% against 9% growth from the comparable year ago period as softness in Western Europe more than offset a strong high single-digit improvement in the Middle East and Africa.
Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 1%, primarily resulting from the contribution of IFF Ottens Flavors and strong benefits from productivity initiatives. Fragrances currency-neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 4 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, with all regions posting growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in Latin America.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 7% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins, led by North America, which achieved strong double-digit growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and low single digit growth in Latin America. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% with broad-based growth across all the categories. Technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and Personal Wash contributed high single-digit increases.
Within Consumer Fragrances, on a geographic basis, all regions delivered growth, led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and a mid-single-digit increase in North America, both on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredient sales were up 15%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which, as a reminder, are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remained soft, reflecting continued challenging market conditions as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by our mid-single-digit Fragrance Compounds growth.
 
From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit was very strong, growing about 15% year-over-year, driven by robust volume growth, the benefits in cost and productivity initiatives and more favorable mix. This performance led to over 130 basis point improvement in currency-neutral operating profit margin.
Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million compared with $31 million the prior year period. Our core working capital levels were challenged, principally driven by the timing of payables. We expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.
From a capital structure standpoint, we spent approximately $23 million in expenditures and continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As noted on our year-end call, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia, primarily related to a new flavors manufacturing plant in China, which was disclosed on our Q4 conference call, and investments in technology expansions.
 
With regard to China, I'd like to provide some additional commentary as it relates to our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We, as well as other chemical plants in the same industrial zone, received a request from the Chinese government to relocate our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Zhejiang. Currently, we are in discussions with the government regarding the intent, purpose and timing of the request of relocation.
 
If we were ultimately required to move, our company and government authorities would need to agree upon the amount and nature of government compensation, including adequate timing and financial support. This is similar to a move required a few years ago when we worked in partnership with the Chinese government to relocate one of our Fragrance Ingredients plants from one industrial park to another over an extended period with minimal business impact. Please note that the relocation request is an evolving situation. We will continue to keep you updated.
 
Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in Q1, we spent approximately $45 million on dividend payouts and $40 million on share repurchases. Given these levels and our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to meet our total payout ratio objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income.
Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. While there are some indications that the global environment has marginally improved, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic with respect to achieving our previously stated financial guidance for 2016 given the persistent volatility in the market. As it is still early in the year, and we believe that the first quarter 2016 partially benefited from timing of orders from Q4 of 2015 to Q1 of 2016, we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate results.
In the second quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that we are comparing to a low effective tax rate in the prior year period when we benefited from the timing of an R&D tax credit. That benefit is not expected to repeat itself again this year.
As a reminder, for the full year 2016, we expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point of contribution from the acquisitions of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.
 
Given the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I would also like to address the impact of currency on our financial results. While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our guidance to reflect the movement of the U.S. dollar to other world currencies since the beginning of the year. As I have discussed in the past, the euro is clearly the largest driver in terms of our currency basket, representing approximately 35% of our profit exposure.
 
Previously, we expected the devaluation of the euro versus the U.S. Dollar to represent approximately 4 out of our original 5 percentage point headwind to profit in 2016. Now given the euro-USD exchange rate in Q1, the fact that we are hedged approximately 75% at $1.14 in 2016 and assuming a spot rate of $1.13, we expect about a 3 percentage point impact from the euro as our expected weighted average exchange rate for 2016 is $1.135 versus our average rate of $1.25 for 2015.
The rest of the currencies within our basket have improved versus our original guidance and now are expected to effectively offset one another on a profitability basis. As such, we expect currency to have a 2 percentage point impact on sales versus 2.5 previously assumed. We expect a 3 percentage point impact on operating profit and EPS should current rates remain constant for the balance of the year.
The increased volatility and duration of the currency movement continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. We measure the impact of currency on various fronts, including translation and transaction impact as well as timing effects associated with our supply chain and inventory movements. We recognize that there are potentially different approaches that can be used to measure this impact and that the methodology differs amongst our industry and peer groups. We regularly review our methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight to our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how the business is run or information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are in the process of our current review, we believe that if we were to adopt a different methodology, it would likely have a positive impact on our currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth in 2016.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

And unfortunately, we believe that the global environment is still pretty volatile and choppy, as you were saying, because we see in some areas of the world, we see actually very good growth trends. We just came back, Alison, myself from Middle East and Africa. We see good double-digit growth in the region despite the political unrest. We have other areas, for example, in China where we're seeing basically a slowdown in growth. So you see from a geographic point of view, it's very volatile at the moment. And even in the U.S., it's not super consistent with what we're seeing. On top of it, we see differences in between the different categories. Let me give you an example. If you look, for example, to Modulation or Sweetness Modulation, That's something which is certainly facilitating our growth because we see more countries moving in towards a sugar tax. The U.K. just did it. South Africa's on the brink to do it. So that's something which is driving growth in the category. But in other categories, we don't see as much growth because it goes against it. So it's a very complex picture, and that's the reason why we say we have to deal with that kind of volatility around the globe. So we believe that the market probably has a growth for Flavors and Fragrances between 2% and maybe 3%, but that's very much on the high end. On the active cosmetics, we still see much higher growth trends between, let's say, 5% and 6%. So it's a pretty difficult picture at the moment."

So we still see, in the Beverage category, for us, on the Flavors side, and we're actually pretty proud because it looks like this category in particular has a certain delivery system for powders. It's helping us because it facilitates growth in a population category, which is lower middle class and lower income, which is really helping us to drive our growth there. And we see it basically on the modulation as well. And here again, the scene comes back. I just touched on it with the Sweetness Modulation. So replacement of sugar and helping with Sweetness Modulation is something which is a big trend and which helps us with our sales in that category."

But what is clear for us is that we have, in the last couple of years, we have invested a lot in CapEx. We have built new manufacturing plants in Indonesia and Turkey and China, and that helped us a lot. We have on our agenda, as you well know, we have still India and the second plant in China, but that's basically built into our plan for the coming years. So we believe we might spend between 4.5% and 5% for the next 2 years, maybe 3 years on CapEx. And then CapEx will go down to more of the maintenance level of 3.5 percentage points. So nothing has changed on our side. In terms of the valuation of M&A targets, I agree. They are usually high, but they were high last year as well. And we are very happy with 2 acquisitions we have done. So I think that it always depends what kind of targets you find and what kind of price you can close and what kind of strategy you apply then afterwards to make the business grow. So I won't be more optimistic that you still can find good targets here. And as you know, we are not doing anything outrageous.

How much is incremental in terms of what the CapEx spend is going to be for potentially 1, 2 new facilities? What's your current capacity utilization in that market?

I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter 2 came in as we anticipated with currency neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 2 percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic business grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. 
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business by simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions.
Currency neutral EPS improved to 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Turning our attention now to Vision 2020. As we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems and naturals, proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter. 
In Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continues its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continues its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency neutral base led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash.  In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our Flavors a superior palate to work from, to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers.
We also set a new benchmark for Fragrances sustainability with the release of the first ever Cradle to Cradle Certified Fragrance, PuraVita. The fragrance, which is green applewood apricot and vanillin, a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers creativity sustainable design principles.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved high single digits, led by solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through the second quarter as currency neutral sales improved mid-single digits and strong growth coming from Flavors. Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME.
We continue to position ourselves to be our customer's partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world. As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, the new sustainability strategy centered on the 3 main aspects: positive principles, regenerative products and sensational people. For this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask, ""what if?"" and to take a complex challenges by imagining what is possible and sustainability, innovation and passion combine.
We also achieved [indiscernible] status with customers in the second quarter. With this status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage helping to drive future growth in the years to come.
We are also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainable improved food security, increase yields and diversify income while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world, and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security.
Finally, in quarter 2, we also deployed the industry first on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 megawatts, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1,900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs. And when combined with purchase agreement electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I am pleased to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand0alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance, both in terms of growth and returns. 
Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Québec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics' access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable source extracts from the forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison"

Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid and were consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately 2 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF' Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continue to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign exchange related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency neutral sales would have increased approximately 6% and on a 2-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors. 
Adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with volume growth, benefits associated with cost productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50 basis point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program, are offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well.  Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity program and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016.
Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased to 3%, including approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy. 
From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single digit increases in North America, Europe Africa Middle East and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. Europe Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continue to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter.  Greater Asia posted 6% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in Indonesia, India and ASEAN. 
On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency neutral basis based on a strong 14% currency neutral prior year comparable growth rate. From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency neutral basis. However, with was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina. 
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from a volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency neutral basis. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 3 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% at a currency neutral basis as a strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business. The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency neutral basis, driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single digit growth in Home Care.  On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Fragrance ingredient sales were up 14%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year. 
From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year, resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As a result, currency neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million compared with $166 million the prior year period. This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged principally by the timing of payables within our year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016. 
From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales. And we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions.
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's stock, an increase of 15% to bring our dividend yield to around 2%. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders. 
With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. 
In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest, given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency neutral operating profit to grow less than sales in Q3, given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments. 
While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefit from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same at 2 and 3 points respectively. And the impact on EPS is lower by approximately 1 percentage point. 
At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at 1 14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at 1 13. 
As we discussed in our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are still reviewing recurring methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees end-year compensation is linked to our current methodology. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

We will have elections in the U.S. We have seen the Brexit. And we have seen other events like Turkey, for example, where we have to be cautious. And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance, and we believe we are on track to make it, but the volatility is certainly unprecedented. Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about '17. I believe that we need to some more time because we have first of all to finish '16.

And we are playing in the premium segment of that market, which gives us an extra profitability and certainly a good growth as well. So that's important to understand that was the reason why we ventured into that business. On the Flavors side, different approach because as we said, and probably many of our competitors are telling you that as well, that you see some of the smaller midsize companies with higher growth rates. And we did kind of a differentiated service model for that kind of part of the market as well. And that was reason we acquired Ottens to use as a platform in that segment, because this is where usually customers, we were not reaching out as much as we would like to have it.

We always see this kind of spikes Lombard are going forward in I'm actually very optimistic in a long way that these will stay good growth areas for us. And the good thing within IFF this, as you might know, is that we have 50% of our business in the emerging markets and 50% in the mature markets.

Once finished, Alison will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have.
I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter 2 came in as we anticipated with currency neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 2 percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic business grew 2% on a currency neutral basis driven by new wins across both businesses.
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business by simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions.
Currency neutral EPS improved 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Turning our attention now to Vision 2020. As we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems and naturals, proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter.
In Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continues its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continued its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency neutral base led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our Flavors a superior palate to work from to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers.
We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of the first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified fragrance, PuraVita, a fragrance, which has noted of green apple, wood, apricot and vanilla, is a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principles.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016 driven primarily by contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrance improved high single digits led by a solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through second quarter as currency neutral sales improved mid-single digits with strong growth coming from Flavors. Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME.
We continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world. As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, the new sustainability strategy centered on the 3 main aspects: positive principles, regenerative products and sensational people. For this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask, ""What if?"" and to take a complex challenges by imagining what is possible when sustainability, innovation and passion combine.
We also achieved core list status with key customers in the second quarter. With this core list status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage helping to drive future growth in the years to come.
We are also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainable, improved food security, increase yields and diversify income while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world, and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition, to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security.
Finally, in quarter 2, we also deployed the industry-first on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 megawatts, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1,900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs. And when combined with purchased green electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm pleased to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance, both in terms of growth and return.
Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Québec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics' access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable source extracts from the Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid and were consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately 2 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign-exchange-related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency neutral sales would have increased to approximately 6% and on a 2-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors.
Adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with volume growth, benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50 basis point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity programs and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016.
Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, including approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth, the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy.
From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in North America, Europe Africa and Middle East and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. Europe, Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continue to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter. Greater Asia posted 6% currency neutral growth led by strong growth in Indonesia, India and ASEAN.
On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency neutral basis based on a strong 14% currency neutral prior year comparable growth rate. From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency neutral basis, however, was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency neutral basis. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 3 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% on a currency neutral basis as strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and Middle East where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business. The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency neutral basis, driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single-digit growth in Home Care.
On a geographic basis in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 14% driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year.
From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year, resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As a result, currency neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million compared with $166 million in the prior year period. This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged principally by the timing of payables within a year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.
From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales, and we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions.
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's common stock, an increase of 15% to bring our dividend yield to around 2%. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.
In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency neutral operating profit to grow less than sales in Q3 given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments.
While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefited from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same at 2 and 3 points, respectively, and the impact on EPS is lower by approximately 1 percentage point.
At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at $1.14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at $1.13.
As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are still reviewing recurring methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees' end-year compensation is linked to our current methodology.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

We will have elections in the U.S. We see -- we have seen the Brexit. And we have seen other events like Turkey, for example, where we have to be cautious. And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance, and we believe we're on track to make it, but the volatility is certainly unprecedented. Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about '17. I believe that needs some more time because we have, first of all, to finish '16. But we will return, and we're optimistic to return to our long-term guidance because what we see is actually a couple of things. First of all, we have an unprecedented pipeline strength in terms of new molecules for fragrances, for example. We see great progress in some of our other R&D platforms like modulation and naturals. And that will help us to gain share going forward, and that's the reason which makes me cautiously optimistic for the years to come."

So that's important to understand. That was the reason why we ventured into that business. On the Flavors side, different approach because, as we said, and probably many of our competitors are telling you that as well, is that you see some of the smaller, midsized companies with higher growth rates. And we needed kind of a differentiated service model for that kind of part of the market as well. And that was reason that we acquired Ottens to use it as a platform in that segment because there were usually customers who we're not reaching out as much as we would like to have it. And now we have the platform. We are filling the platform, and we are pretty happy with it."

And if it's not, like are there steps you can take to address that to make sure it doesn't have any significant impact on results going forward?
I actually believe, in particular, in the emerging markets, it's temporary because in the mid and long term, you will see still, let's say, a very significant population growth, and people are trending towards middle class, lower middle class. And these are all potential customers for our products. Just if you look at the numbers, for example, Africa and Middle East is an area, which is expanding double digit for us, and you will see a doubling of the population in Africa until 2050. So it will happen. We always see these kind of spikes or lambadas going forward, and I'm actually very optimistic in a long way is that these will stay good growth areas for us. And the good thing within IFF is, as you might know, is that we have 50% of our business in the emerging markets and 50% in the mature markets. And so that will help us when we see these markets returning to good growth here. Whether we will see, like see in China again, double-digit growth over years, I doubt it. But even if you see, let's say, 6% or 7% growth, I think it's still a pretty significant one."

Once finished, Alison will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have.
I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter 2 came in as we anticipated with currency neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 2 percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic business grew 2% on a currency neutral basis driven by new wins across both businesses.
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business by simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions.
Currency neutral EPS improved 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Turning our attention now to Vision 2020. As we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems and naturals, proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter.
In Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continues its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continued its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency neutral base led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our Flavors a superior palate to work from to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers.
We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of the first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified fragrance, PuraVita, a fragrance, which has noted of green apple, wood, apricot and vanilla, is a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principles.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016 driven primarily by contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrance improved high single digits led by a solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through second quarter as currency neutral sales improved mid-single digits with strong growth coming from Flavors. Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME.
We continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world. As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, the new sustainability strategy centered on the 3 main aspects: positive principles, regenerative products and sensational people. For this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask, ""What if?"" and to tackle complex challenges by imagining what is possible when sustainability, innovation and passion combine.
We also achieved core list status with key customers in the second quarter. With this core list status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage helping to drive future growth in the years to come.
We are also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainable, improved food security, increase yields and diversify income while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world, and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition, to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security.
Finally, in quarter 2, we also deployed the industry-first on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 megawatts, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1,900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs. And when combined with purchased green electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm pleased to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance, both in terms of growth and return.
Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Québec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics' access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable source extracts from the Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid and were consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately 2 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign-exchange-related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency neutral sales would have increased to approximately 6% and on a 2-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors.
Adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with volume growth, benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50 basis point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity programs and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016.
Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, including approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth, the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy.
From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in North America, Europe, Africa and Middle East and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. Europe, Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continue to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter. Greater Asia posted 6% currency neutral growth led by strong growth in Indonesia, India and ASEAN.
On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency neutral basis based on a strong 14% currency neutral prior year comparable growth rate. From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency neutral basis, however, was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency neutral basis. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 3 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% on a currency neutral basis as strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and Middle East where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business. The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency neutral basis, driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single-digit growth in Home Care.
On a geographic basis in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 14%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year.
From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year, resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As a result, currency neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million compared with $166 million in the prior year period. This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged, principally by the timing of payables within a year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.
From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales, and we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions.
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's common stock, an increase of 15% to bring our dividend yield to around 2%. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.
In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency neutral operating profit to grow less than sales in Q3 given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments.
While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefited from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same at 2 and 3 points, respectively, and the impact on EPS is lower by approximately 1 percentage point.
At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at $1.14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at $1.13.
As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are still reviewing recurring methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees' end-year compensation is linked to our current methodology.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance, and we believe we're on track to make it, but the volatility is certainly unprecedented. Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about '17. I believe that needs some more time because we have, first of all, to finish '16. But we will return, and we're optimistic to return to our long-term guidance because what we see is actually a couple of things.

On the Flavors side, different approach because, as we said, and probably many of our competitors are telling you that as well, is that you see some of the smaller, midsized companies with higher growth rates. And we needed kind of a differentiated service model for that kind of part of the market as well.

So it will happen. We always see these kind of spikes or lambadas going forward, and I'm actually very optimistic in a long way is that these will stay good growth areas for us. And the good thing within IFF is, as you might know, is that we have 50% of our business in the emerging markets and 50% in the mature markets. And so that will help us when we see these markets returning to good growth here. Whether we will see, like see in China again, double-digit growth over years, I doubt it.

Once finished, Alison will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have.
I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter 2 came in as we anticipated with currency neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 2 percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic business grew 2% on a currency neutral basis driven by new wins across both businesses.
From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business by simultaneously delivering 7% currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions.
Currency neutral EPS improved 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Turning our attention now to Vision 2020. As we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems and naturals, proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter.
In Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continues its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continued its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency neutral base led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our Flavors a superior palate to work from to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers.
We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of the first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified fragrance, PuraVita, a fragrance, which has noted of green apple, wood, apricot and vanilla, is a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principles.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016 driven primarily by contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrance improved high single digits led by a solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through second quarter as currency neutral sales improved mid-single digits with strong growth coming from Flavors. Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME.
We continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world. As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, the new sustainability strategy centered on the 3 main aspects: positive principles, regenerative products and sensational people. For this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask, ""What if?"" and to tackle complex challenges by imagining what is possible when sustainability, innovation and passion combine.
We also achieved core list status with key customers in the second quarter. With this core list status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage helping to drive future growth in the years to come.
We are also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainable, improved food security, increase yields and diversify income while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world, and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition, to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security.
Finally, in quarter 2, we also deployed the industry-first on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 megawatts, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1,900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs. And when combined with purchased green electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.
In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm pleased to report that our 2 recent strategic acquisitions continued to perform well. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a stand-alone basis, and IFF Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance, both in terms of growth and return.
Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Québec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics' access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable source extracts from the Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison."

Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid and were consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately 2 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and",1329,"Thank you, Andreas. Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid and were consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately 2 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign-exchange-related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency neutral sales would have increased to approximately 6% and on a 2-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors.
Adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that, when combined with volume growth, benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50 basis point improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit margin.
Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity programs and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016.
Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, including approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth, the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy.
From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in North America, Europe, Africa and Middle East and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors. Europe, Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continue to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter. Greater Asia posted 6% currency neutral growth led by strong growth in Indonesia, India and ASEAN.
On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency neutral basis based on a strong 14% currency neutral prior year comparable growth rate. From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency neutral basis, however, was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina.
Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency neutral basis. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 3 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% on a currency neutral basis as strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and Middle East where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business. The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency neutral basis, driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single-digit growth in Home Care.
On a geographic basis in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 14%, driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year.
From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year, resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As a result, currency neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million compared with $166 million in the prior year period. This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged, principally by the timing of payables within a year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016.
From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales, and we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions.
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's common stock, an increase of 15% to bring our dividend yield to around 2%. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF Ottens Flavors and IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program.
In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency neutral operating profit to grow less than sales in Q3 given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments.
While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefited from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same at 2 and 3 points, respectively, and the impact on EPS is lower by approximately 1 percentage point.
At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at $1.14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at $1.13.
As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are still reviewing recurring methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees' end-year compensation is linked to our current methodology.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

We will have elections in the U.S. We see -- we have seen the Brexit. And we have seen other events like Turkey, for example, where we have to be cautious. And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance, and we believe we're on track to make it, but the volatility is certainly unprecedented. Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about '17. I believe that needs some more time because we have, first of all, to finish '16. But we will return, and we're optimistic to return to our long-term guidance because what we see is actually a couple of things. First of all, we have an unprecedented pipeline strength in terms of new molecules for fragrances, for example. We see great progress in some of our other R&D platforms like modulation and naturals. And that will help us to gain share going forward, and that's the reason which makes me cautiously optimistic for the years to come."

As usually, we would like to start with an executive overview of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, Rich will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will be finished by taking any questions that you may have.
In the third quarter, currency neutral sales grew 3%, led by an improved performance in flavors, plus approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both business units, along with increased volumes in Fragrance Ingredients. On a currency neutral operating profit perspective, we expected Quarter 3 performance to be muted, given the timing of planned investments, yet results came in softer than expected. This is largely attributable to lower-than-expected gross margin performance. Rich will provide more details in a moment. 
As a result, currency neutral adjusted EPS in quarter 3 was challenged despite the benefits from lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program and a more favorable effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first 9 months of 2016 improved 4%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3%, driven by sales growth, benefits of our productivity initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions. It should be noted that this is inclusive of approximately 3 percentage points of planned strategic investments as well as litigation and compliance-related costs made over the course of 2016. A portion of this investment is intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the future. This, combined with lower shares outstanding and a more favorable effective tax rate, had a positive effect on our currency neutral adjusted EPS, which increased 5% in the first 9 months of 2016.
Reviewing our progress against our Vision 2020 ambition, we continued to achieve strong results in the key areas that we've identified as strategic priorities for us: encapsulation, modulation, North America, Africa and the Middle East, to name a few. From innovating first perspective in Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit growth, currency neutral growth across all categories. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales of Personal Wash and Home Care improved strong double digits in a currency neutral basis, demonstrating that our technology is starting to gain traction in areas outside of Fabric Care. In the third quarter, we also launched 4 new flavor molecules in the key tonalities [ph] of citrus, onion and garlic to help our flavors continue to build consumer preferred products that perform in the marketplace. 
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently commercialized a new captive fragrance ingredient called Saffiano [ph] to further drive differentiation. This particular fragrance ingredient is a strong, rich natural leather, with powdery soft sweet quality, providing a unique more interest, and is very additive to many fragrance creations. It enhances strength and increases the facets and fragrance, of course, by providing a very clean natural effect. The combination of the 2 molecules we have released so far this year, plus the 2 we expect to commercialize in the fourth quarter, puts us on track to double our annual fragrance molecule output average from 2 per year to 4 per year. In addition to this expansion, we have also adjusted our commercial fragrance ingredient strategy to release these types of captive molecules to the external market sooner to accelerate value creation.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, our growth has accelerated. Our strong growth momentum in the Middle East and Africa continued in the third quarter as currency neutral sales improved strong double digit, with both businesses achieving very strong growth. In North America fragrance, we saw 6% increase for the third quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in Fabric Care. This was led by our encapsulation platform as we continued to leverage this technology to gain market share. Another strategic area for us is Home Care, grew low single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia.
We also continued to position ourselves to be our customers' Partner of Choice and go-to supplier. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth global consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service in the highest quality of products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both local and faster-growing regional economies, with regionals outpacing global accounts. The strength in our [ph] acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and more recently David Michael and Fragrance Resources, the one we announced our intention to purchase last week, are all very strong from their regional customer basis.
We are also collaborating with Delos and Mayo Clinic to be a part of their Well Living Lab, which is a new research facility dedicated to understanding the impacts between health and well-being and indoor environments through human-centered research. This world-class living lab leverages and expands upon the principles of the well building standard, which focuses on 7 concepts relevant to indoor health: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort and mind. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise in scent to help improve the lives of individuals.
In the third quarter, we also became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum. As pioneers of the centers for more than 127 years, we embrace this unique opportunity to exchange ideas with other leading organizations who are interested in making positive lasting changes in society. This collaboration with the former aligns with IFF's Vision 2020 strategy, which underscores how we as a company and businesses in general can innovate in the area of artistry, science, technology and sustainability to produce positive results for both business and society.
I'm also proud to be elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. I'm extremely excited to represent IFF and about our journey as an organization to help leave the world a better place for generations to come.
We continued our trend of strengthening and expanding our portfolio by accelerating our efforts in M&A, with the addition of approximately USD 160 million in expected annualized sales on the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, both of which complement our strategic vision well. I will speak in more detail about each of these acquisitions in a moment. I'm happy to report that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continues to perform well, achieving double-digit growth on a standalone basis. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term, value-creating opportunities.
Turning to our more recent acquisition announcements. David Michael is a privately-held flavors company headquartered in Philadelphia. The company is well known in the industry for its vanilla expertise, strengths in dairy and beverage categories and the relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle-market customers. David Michael complements our Ottens Flavors acquisitions from last year by strengthening our ability to serve the faster-growing midmarket customers in North America and solidifies our strong #1 position in Flavors North America, a strategic priority for us. The deal, which closed on October 7, is expected to add approximately USD 85 million of sales in 2017 and expected to be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. This bolt-on acquisition is another important milestone in IFF's Vision 2020, helping us win where we compete in the world's largest flavor market as we look to further accelerate growth.
Late last week, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Fragrance Resources, a privately-held, family-owned fragrance company who for nearly 30 years has distinguished itself exceptional creative talent and quality service to faster-growing regional customers. This highly complementary bolt-on acquisition further will increase our penetration in specialty fragrances, a faster-growing subcategory within Fine Fragrances, and is expected to strengthen our market share position with a regional customer base within the key markets of North America and Germany. Fragrance Resources is expected to add about USD 75 million of sales in 2017 and is also be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. Right now, we expect an early 2017 close, and we look forward to welcoming Fragrance Resources to IFF.
The combination of both acquisitions is expected to contribute approximately 4.5 percentage points to our currency neutral sales growth in 2017. This, plus expected cost synergy benefits, will lead to greater financial performance in the years to come. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich."

Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growth of 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a c",1747,"Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growth of 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited from approximately 1 percentage point related to the contribution of our Lucas Myers Cosmetics acquisition. On an organic basis, we grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. 
I want to provide you with greater insight with respect to our performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing for Q3. As a reminder, our industry indexes the majority of its pricing in emerging markets to movements in foreign exchange rates. For example, in Brazil, while actual invoicing is done in Brazilian real, the invoice amount is indexed back to hard currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar. On a predetermined basis, prices are adjusted up or down to reflect the underlying movements of currency and the product profile. When reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency neutral sales growth calculation. This is different from our competition. 
In Q3, adjusting our currency neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to how our competition reports, our currency neutral sales growth would have increased approximately 3% organically and 4% inclusive of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. On a 2-year basis, to factor in the year-ago performance, organic currency neutral sales would have increased to an average of 4.5%, which is ahead of our largest competitor by approximately 150 basis points. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit was down 4% year-over-year, principally due to year-over-year decline in gross margin, and I'll walk you through that in greater detail in a moment. We benefited from a lower year-over-year shares outstanding and a more favorable tax rate that helped to offset the impact of our operating performance on a currency neutral adjusted EPS basis.
Looking at our Q3 currency neutral operating profit results, I want to provide more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you see the contribution of our cost and productivity initiatives due to likes of formula optimization, indirect procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies in both compounds businesses, we delivered approximately 6 percentage point benefit year-over-year to overall profitability. In the third bar, you can see the growth added approximately 5% to profitability. From a headwind perspective, there are several items that we need -- I need to elaborate on.
In the fourth bar, RSA expenses represented approximately a 5 percentage point drag on operating profit. It should be noted that this includes approximately 3 percentage points related to planned investments that we mentioned earlier in the year and another 1 percentage point in compliance and litigation-related costs. The strategic investments, while they challenge profitability in the short term, are expected to yield PNR leverage in the years to come. The greatest gap to our previous guidance came in the form of weaker sales mix. Beverages, our highest margin category in Flavors, had limited growth in the quarter, while Savory, a less profitable category, performed very well, growing high single digits. On the Fragrance side, we experienced a similar dynamic, with Fine Fragrances, a strong margin category, declining year-over-year, while we experienced growth for the first time in approximately 2 years in our Fragrance Ingredients business, which is a less profitable category. Net net, this led to an unfavorable sales mix, which represented a 3% drag to operating profit.
In addition, we were also pressured by year-over-year manufacturing performance, principally related to manufacturing yields in our Fragrance Ingredient manufacturing network. Rounding out our performance, price and input costs and other miscellaneous items, including the year-over-year change in incentive compensation were the remaining headwinds.
Turning to our business unit performance for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, driven by mid-single digit growth in Savory, Dairy and Sweet. From a regional perspective, growth was led by high single-digit increases in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. North American results were challenged, reflecting low single-digit growth in Savory and Sweet that was offset by softness in Beverage. Europe, Africa and Middle East increased 5% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Savory and Sweet. Africa and the Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double digits in the third quarter. Greater Asia posted 5% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in India, Asia, Indonesia and China, which returned to growth after several quarters of decline, partly due to the manufacturing order issues that we saw in early 2015. We're happy to see this business is stabilizing and returning to growth as the order issue is behind us. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved double-digit growth in both Beverage and Dairy.
Growth in Latin America rebounded, improving 7% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in both Brazil and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit was challenged as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price to input costs and increases in RSA.
Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2%, including approximately 1 percentage point associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Growth was led by high single-digit growth in ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was challenged on a currency neutral basis, had strong double-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in North America was more than offset by softness in Latin America and Western Europe. It should be noted that we believe that a part of our softness in Fine Fragrance can be attributed to a large Fine Fragrance customer who is going through a portfolio transition via divestiture. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by high single-digit increase in Greater Asia and mid-single-digit growth in North America. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, driven by low single-digit growth on an organic basis and the contribution of sales related to IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral sales profit declined as volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price and input costs, manufacturing performances and increases in RSA.
From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow improved 12% versus the same period in 2015. Our operating cash flow was 14% of sales, up from 12.8% in the first 9 months of 2015. This change was driven with our core working capital levels improving versus year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivable. In terms of capital deployment, capital expenditures through the first 9 months totaled $70 million and we are on track to spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will be principally driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions. 
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders, during the first 9 months of 2016, we spent approximately $134 million on dividends and $94 million on share repurchases. This puts us on target to deliver on our commitment to return 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
As we finish up 2016, we expect business trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. We expect stronger currency neutral top line growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by improvements in both Flavors and Fragrances and the benefits of our acquisition of David Michael. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that David Michael will add about 200 basis points to currency neutral sales growth in Q4, while providing limited benefits on an operating profit basis, given the increase in purchase price accounting impacts. From a currency neutral operating profit basis, growth is expected to strengthen in the fourth quarter and while we do expect pressure on gross margins to continue, given the sales mix dynamics we discussed earlier, we believe that improvement in volume trends and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives will drive operating profit growth year-over-year. This compares as we compare to our largest year-over-year quarterly reset in incentive comp during the fourth quarter last year. The combination of this currency neutral operating profit performance, plus lower shares outstanding and some benefits in our effective tax rate, is expected to lead growth in currency neutral EPS also.
Upon entering 2016, we expected challenging conditions, given the high level of economic uncertainty and a more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. As evident in today's marketplace, this is indeed the case as volume consumption remains challenged across many end market categories and economic volatility and visibility in key markets around the world remains challenging. We acknowledge that we are slightly lowering the previous guidance we provided earlier this year. Nevertheless, the viability of our business remains strong and we expect to deliver growth across all of our key financial metrics on a currency neutral basis. 
For the full year, we see currency neutral sales improving 4% to 5% versus 2015, with broad-based contributions from organic and inorganic business. Currency neutral operating profit is expected to go up 3.5% to 4.5%, in large by due to benefits of cost and productivity improvements, increased volumes and the benefits of acquisitions.
It should be noted inclusive in our guidance is approximately 3 percentage points of litigation and compliance-related costs as well as planned strategic investments made over the course of 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these investments are intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the years to come. From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we expect to modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of the share repurchase program to lead to 5% to 6% improvement on an EPS basis.
In terms of foreign exchange, we have tweaked the impact of currency on our guidance as it is slightly more favorable. On a sales basis, we expect currency to impact results by approximately 1.5 percentage points and for adjusted operating profit and EPS, we expect a 2 percentage point impact. With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Andreas."

Vanilla is certainly one of those key aspects that we're seeing that pressure. As Andreas talked about, I mean, the acquisition of David Michael will help us on that aspect. On the fragrance side, it's really a couple of things. One, from a pricing standpoint, it's been more about pricing pressure from a customer standpoint and then the second piece is really related to our ingredients business. We are -- we've wanted to address the declines in that business and we've gone and look at our go-to-market strategy and want to protect our market share more aggressively and so we've had to adjust pricing accordingly.

As usually, we would like to start with an executive overview of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished,",1538,"Thank you, Michael. As usually, we would like to start with an executive overview of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, Rich will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will be finished by taking any questions that you may have.
In the third quarter, currency neutral sales grew 3%, led by an improved performance in Flavors, plus approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both business units, along with increased volumes in Fragrance Ingredients. 
On a currency neutral operating profit perspective, we expected quarter 3 performance to be muted given the timing of planned investments, yet results came in softer than expected. This is largely attributed to lower-than-expected gross margin performance. Rich will provide more details in a moment. 
As a result, currency neutral adjusted EPS in quarter 3 was challenged despite the benefits from lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program and a more favorable effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first 9 months of 2016 improved 4%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3%, driven by sales growth, benefits of our productivity initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions. It should be noted that this is inclusive of approximately 3 percentage points of planned strategic investments as well as litigation and compliance-related costs made over the course of 2016. A portion of this investment is intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the future. 
This, combined with lower shares outstanding and a more favorable effective tax rate, had a positive effect on our currency neutral adjusted EPS, which increased 5% in the first 9 months of 2016.
Reviewing our progress against our Vision 2020 ambition, we continued to achieve strong results in the key areas that we've identified as strategic priorities for us: encapsulation, modulation, North America, Africa and the Middle East, to name a few. From innovating first perspective in Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit growth, currency neutral growth across all categories. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales of Personal Wash and Home Care improved strong double digits in a currency neutral basis, demonstrating that our technology is starting to gain traction in areas outside of Fabric Care. In the third quarter, we also launched 4 new flavor molecules in the key tonalities of citrus, onion and garlic to help our flavors continue to build consumer-preferred products that perform in the marketplace. 
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently commercialized a new captive fragrance ingredient called Saffiano to further drive differentiation. This particular fragrance ingredient is a strong, rich, natural leather, with powdery, soft, sweet quality, providing a unique more interest, and is very additive to many fragrance creations. It enhances strength and increases the facets and fragrance, of course, by providing a very clean, natural effect. 
The combination of the 2 molecules we have released so far this year, plus the 2 we expect to commercialize in the fourth quarter, puts us on track to double our annual fragrance molecule output average from 2 per year to 4 per year. In addition to this expansion, we have also adjusted our commercial fragrance ingredient strategy to release these types of captive molecules to the external market sooner to accelerate value creation.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, our growth has accelerated. Our strong growth momentum in the Middle East and Africa continued in the third quarter as currency neutral sales improved strong double digit, with both businesses achieving very strong growth. In North America Fragrance, we saw 6% increase for the third quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in Fabric Care. This was led by our encapsulation platform as we continued to leverage this technology to gain market share. Another strategic area for us is Home Care, grew low single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia.
We also continued to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth global consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service in the highest quality of products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both local and faster-growing regional accounts, with regionals outpacing global accounts. This should strengthen as our acquisition of Ottens Flavors and more recently, David Michael and Fragrance Resources, the one we announced our intention to purchase last week, are all very strong from their regional customer basis.
We are also collaborating with Delos and Mayo Clinic to be a part of their Well Living Lab, which is a new research facility dedicated to understanding the impacts between health and well-being and indoor environments through human-centered research. This world-class living lab leverages and expands upon the principles of the well building standard, which focuses on 7 concepts relevant to indoor health: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort and mind. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise in scent to help improve the lives of individuals.
In the third quarter, we also became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum. As pioneers of the senses for more than 127 years, we embrace this unique opportunity to exchange ideas with other leading organizations who are interested in making positive, lasting changes in society. This collaboration with the former aligns with IFF's Vision 2020 strategy, which underscores how we as a company and businesses in general can innovate in the area of artistry, science, technology and sustainability to produce positive results for both business and society.
I'm also proud to be elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. I'm extremely excited to represent IFF and about our journey as an organization to help leave the world a better place for generations to come.
We continued our trend of strengthening and expanding our portfolio by accelerating our efforts in M&A, with the addition of approximately USD 160 million in expected annualized sales on the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, both of which complement our strategic vision well. I will speak in more detail about each of these acquisitions in a moment. 
I'm happy to report that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continues to perform well, achieving double-digit growth on a standalone basis. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long term, value-creating opportunities.
Turning to our more recent acquisition announcements. David Michael is a privately-held flavors company headquartered in Philadelphia. The company is well known in the industry for its vanilla expertise, strengths in Dairy and Beverage categories and the relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle-market customers. David Michael complements our Ottens Flavors acquisition from last year by strengthening our ability to serve the faster-growing mid-market customers in North America and solidifies our strong #1 position in Flavors North America, a strategic priority for us. 
The deal, which closed on October 7, is expected to add approximately USD 85 million of sales in 2017 and expected to be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. This bolt-on acquisition is another important milestone in IFF's Vision 2020, helping us win where we compete in the world's largest flavor market as we look to further accelerate growth.
Late last week, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Fragrance Resources, a privately-held, family-owned fragrance company who, for nearly 30 years, has distinguished itself, exceptional creative talent and quality service to faster-growing regional customers. This highly complementary bolt-on acquisition further will increase our penetration in specialty fragrances, a faster-growing subcategory within Fine Fragrances, and is expected to strengthen our market share position with a regional customer base within the key markets of North America and Germany. 
Fragrance Resources is expected to add about USD 75 million of sales in 2017 and is also be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. Right now, we expect an early 2017 close, and we look forward to welcoming Fragrance Resources to IFF.
The combination of both acquisitions is expected to contribute approximately 4.5 percentage points to our currency neutral sales growth in 2017. This, plus expected cost synergy benefits, will lead to greater financial performance in the years to come. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich."
281407,405145374,1079832,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growth of 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a c",1754,"Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growth of 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited from approximately 1 percentage point related to the contribution of our Lucas Myer Cosmetics acquisition. On an organic basis, we grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. 
I want to provide you with greater insight with respect to our performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing for Q3. As a reminder, our industry indexes the majority of its pricing in emerging markets to movements in foreign exchange rates. For example, in Brazil, while actual invoicing is done in Brazilian real, the invoice amount is indexed back to hard currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar. On a predetermined basis, prices are adjusted up or down to reflect the underlying movements of currency and the product profile. When reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency neutral sales growth calculation. This is different from our competition. 
In Q3, adjusting our currency neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to how our competition reports, our currency neutral sales growth would have increased to approximately 3% organically and 4% inclusive of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. On a 2-year basis, to factor in the year-ago performance, organic currency neutral sales would have increased to an average of 4.5%, which is ahead of our largest competitor by approximately 150 basis points. 
From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit was down 4% year-over-year, principally due to year-over-year decline in gross margin, and I'll walk you through that in greater detail in a moment. We benefited from a lower year-over-year shares outstanding and a more favorable tax rate that helped offset the impact of our operating performance on a currency neutral adjusted EPS basis.
Looking at our Q3 currency neutral operating profit results, I want to provide more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you see the contribution of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to likes of formula optimization, indirect procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies in both compounds businesses, we delivered approximately 6 percentage point benefit year-over-year to overall profitability. In the third bar, you can see the growth added approximately 5% to profitability. 
From a headwind perspective, there are several items that we need -- I need to elaborate on. In the fourth bar, RSA expenses represented approximately a 5 percentage point drag on operating profit. It should be noted that this includes approximately 3 percentage points related to planned investments that we mentioned earlier in the year and another 1 percentage point in compliance and litigation-related costs. The strategic investments, while they challenge profitability in the short term, are expected to yield P&L leverage in the years to come. 
The greatest gap to our previous guidance came in the form of weaker sales mix. Beverages, our highest margin category in Flavors, had limited growth in the quarter, while Savory, a less profitable category, performed very well, growing high single digits. On the Fragrance side, we experienced a similar dynamic, with Fine Fragrances, a strong margin category, declining year-over-year, while we experienced growth for the first time in approximately 2 years in our Fragrance Ingredients business, which is a less profitable category. Net-net, this led to an unfavorable sales mix, which represented a 3% drag to operating profit.
In addition, we were also pressured by year-over-year manufacturing performance, principally related to manufacturing yields in our Fragrance Ingredient manufacturing network. Rounding out our performance, price and input costs in other and miscellaneous items, including the year-over-change in incentive compensation, were the remaining headwinds.
Turning to our business unit performance for the third quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, driven by mid-single digit growth in Savory, Dairy and Sweet. From a regional perspective, growth was led by high single-digit increases in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. North American results were challenged, reflecting low single-digit growth in Savory and Sweet that was offset by softness in Beverage. 
Europe, Africa and Middle East increased 5% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Savory and Sweet. Africa and the Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double digits in the current third quarter. Greater Asia posted 5% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in India, Asia, Indonesia and China, which returned to growth after several quarters of decline, partly due to the manufacturing order issues that we saw in early 2015. We're happy to see this business is stabilizing and returning to growth as the order issue is behind us. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved double-digit growth in both Beverage and Dairy.
Growth in Latin America rebounded, improving 7% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in both Brazil and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit was challenged as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price to input costs and increases in RSA.
Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2%, including approximately 1 percentage point associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Growth was led by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was challenged. On a currency neutral basis, had strong double-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in North America was more than offset by softness in Latin America and Western Europe. 
It should be noted that we believe that a part of our softness in Fine Fragrance can be attributed to a large Fine Fragrance customer who is also going -- who is going through a portfolio transition via divestiture. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by high single-digit increase in Greater Asia and mid-single-digit growth in North America. 
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, driven by low single-digit growth on an organic basis and the contribution of sales related to IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral sales profit declined as volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price and input costs, manufacturing performances and increases in RSA.
From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow improved 12% versus the same period in 2015. Our operating cash flow was 14% of sales, up from 12.8% in the first 9 months of 2015. This change was driven by our core working capital levels improving versus year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivable. 
In terms of capital deployment, capital expenditures through the first 9 months totaled $70 million, and we are on track to spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will be principally driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions. 
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders, during the first 9 months of 2016, we spent approximately $134 million on dividends and $94 million on share repurchases. This puts us on target to deliver on our commitment to return 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
As we finish up 2016, we expect business trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. We expect stronger currency neutral top line growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by improvements in both Flavors and Fragrances and the benefits of our acquisition of David Michael. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that David Michael will add about 200 basis points to currency neutral sales growth in Q4 while providing limited benefits on an operating profit basis, given the increase in purchase price accounting impacts. 
From a currency neutral operating profit basis, growth is expected to strengthen in the fourth quarter. And while we do expect pressure on gross margins to continue, given the sales mix dynamics we discussed earlier, we believe that improvement in volume trends and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives will drive operating profit growth year-over-year. This compares as we compare to our largest year-over-year quarterly reset in incentive comp during the fourth quarter last year. 
The combination of this currency neutral operating profit performance, plus lower shares outstanding and some benefits in our effective tax rate, is expected to lead growth in currency neutral EPS also.
Upon entering 2016, we expected challenging conditions, given the high level of economic uncertainty and a more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. As evident in today's marketplace, this is indeed the case as volume consumption remains challenged across many end market categories, and economic volatility and visibility in key markets around the world remains challenging. We acknowledge that we are slightly lowering the previous guidance we provided earlier this year. Nevertheless, the viability of our business remains strong, and we expect to deliver growth across all of our key financial metrics on a currency neutral basis. 
For the full year, we see currency neutral sales improving 4% to 5% versus 2015, with broad-based contributions from organic and inorganic business. Currency neutral operating profit is expected to go up 3.5% to 4.5%, in large part due to benefits of cost and productivity improvements, increased volumes and the benefits of acquisitions.
It should be noted that inclusive in our guidance is approximately 3 percentage points of litigation and compliance-related costs as well as planned strategic investments made over the course of 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these investments are intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the years to come. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we expect to modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of a share repurchase program to lead to 5% to 6% improvement on an EPS basis.
In terms of foreign exchange, we have tweaked the impact of currency on our guidance as it is slightly more favorable. On a sales basis, we expect currency to impact results by approximately 1.5 percentage points, and for our adjusted operating profit and EPS, we expect a 2 percentage point impact. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Andreas."

Our pipeline, as I said, is actually very strong. It was never as strong as it is right now. Emerging markets, we had a dip in the last, let's say, 18 months. We believe that the emerging markets will eventually come back. Also, the currency situation here was challenging for us. And we're diversifying our portfolio as well. In terms of the mix, I believe we have to focus right now on the mix improvement, which we have done in the past. The fixed cost leverage will help with the productivity initiatives.

We've seen some of the benefits this year, but I think they'll continue to ramp up next year into the future.

Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy.

In the third quarter, currency neutral sales grew 3%, led by an improved performance in Flavors, plus approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both business units, along with increased volumes in Fragrance Ingredients. 
On a currency neutral operating profit perspective, we expected quarter 3 performance to be muted given the timing of planned investments, yet results came in softer than expected. This is largely attributed to lower-than-expected gross margin performance. Rich will provide more details in a moment. 
As a result, currency neutral adjusted EPS in quarter 3 was challenged despite the benefits from lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program and a more favorable effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first 9 months of 2016 improved 4%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3%, driven by sales growth, benefits of our productivity initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions. It should be noted that this is inclusive of approximately 3 percentage points of planned strategic investments as well as litigation and compliance-related costs made over the course of 2016. A portion of this investment is intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the future. 
This, combined with lower shares outstanding and a more favorable effective tax rate, had a positive effect on our currency neutral adjusted EPS, which increased 5% in the first 9 months of 2016.
Reviewing our progress against our Vision 2020 ambition, we continued to achieve strong results in the key areas that we've identified as strategic priorities for us: encapsulation, modulation, North America, Africa and the Middle East, to name a few. From innovating first perspective in Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit growth, currency neutral growth across all categories. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales of Personal Wash and Home Care improved strong double digits in a currency neutral basis, demonstrating that our technology is starting to gain traction in areas outside of Fabric Care. In the third quarter, we also launched 4 new flavor molecules in the key tonalities of citrus, onion and garlic to help our flavors continue to build consumer-preferred products that perform in the marketplace. 
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently commercialized a new captive fragrance ingredient called Saffiano to further drive differentiation. This particular fragrance ingredient is a strong, rich, natural leather, with powdery, soft, sweet quality, providing a unique more interest, and is very additive to many fragrance creations. It enhances strength and increases the facets in fragrance, of course, by providing a very clean, natural effect. 
The combination of the 2 molecules we have released so far this year, plus the 2 we expect to commercialize in the fourth quarter, puts us on track to double our annual fragrance molecule output average from 2 per year to 4 per year. In addition to this expansion, we have also adjusted our commercial fragrance ingredient strategy to release these types of captive molecules to the external market sooner to accelerate value creation.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, our growth has accelerated. Our strong growth momentum in the Middle East and Africa continued in the third quarter as currency neutral sales improved strong double digit, with both businesses achieving very strong growth. In North America Fragrance, we saw 6% increase for the third quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in Fabric Care. This was led by our encapsulation platform as we continue to leverage this technology to gain market share. Another strategic area for us is Home Care, grew low single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia.
We also continued to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth global consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality of products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both local and faster-growing regional accounts, with regionals outpacing global accounts. This should strengthen as our acquisition of Ottens Flavors and more recently, David Michael, and Fragrance Resources, the one we announced our intention to purchase last week, are all very strong from their regional customer basis.
We are also collaborating with Delos and Mayo Clinic to be a part of their Well Being Lab (sic) [ Well Living Lab ], which is a new research facility dedicated to understanding the impacts between health and well-being and indoor environments through human-centered research. This world-class living lab leverages and expands upon the principles of the well-building standard, which focuses on 7 concepts relevant to indoor health: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort and mind. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise in scent to help improve the lives of individuals.
In the third quarter, we also became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum. As pioneers of the senses for more than 127 years, we embrace this unique opportunity to exchange ideas with other leading organizations who are interested in making positive, lasting changes in society. This collaboration with a formal alliance was IFF's Vision 2020's strategy, which underscores how we are as a company and businesses in general can innovate in the area of artistry, science, technology and sustainability to produce positive results for both business and society.
I'm also proud to be elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. I'm extremely excited to represent IFF and about our journey as an organization to help leave the world a better place for generations to come.
We continued our trend of strengthening and expanding our portfolio by accelerating our efforts in M&A, with the addition of approximately USD 160 million in expected annualized sales on the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, both of which complement our strategic vision well. I will speak in more detail about each of these acquisitions in a moment. 
I'm happy to report that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continues to perform well, achieving double-digit growth on a standalone basis. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long term, value-creating opportunities.
Turning to our more recent acquisition announcements. David Michael is a privately-held flavors company headquartered in Philadelphia. The company is well known in the industry for its vanilla expertise, strength in dairy and beverage categories and the relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle-market customers. David Michael complements our Ottens Flavors acquisition from last year by strengthening our ability to serve the faster-growing mid-market customers in North America and solidifies our strong #1 position in Flavors North America, a strategic priority for us. 
The deal, which closed on October 7, is expected to add approximately USD 85 million of sales in 2017 and expected to be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. This bolt-on acquisition is another important milestone in IFF's Vision 2020, helping us win where we compete in the world's largest flavor market as we look to further accelerate growth.
Late last week, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Fragrance Resources, a privately-held, family-owned fragrance company who, for nearly 30 years, has distinguished itself, exceptional creative talent and quality service to faster-growing regional customers. This highly complementary bolt-on acquisition further will increase our penetration in specialty fragrances, a faster-growing subcategory within Fine Fragrances, and is expected to strengthen our market share position with a regional customer base within the key markets of North America and Germany. 
Fragrance Resources is expected to add about USD 75 million of sales in 2017 and is also be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. Right now, we expect an early 2017 close, and we look forward to welcoming Fragrance Resources to IFF.
The combination of both acquisitions is expected to contribute approximately 4.5 percentage points to our currency neutral sales growth in 2017. This, plus expected cost synergy benefits, will lead to greater financial performance in the years to come. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich."

Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growing 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a con",1754,"Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growing 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited from approximately 1 percentage point related to the contribution of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition. On an organic basis, we grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. 
I want to provide you with greater insight with respect to our performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing for Q3. As a reminder, our industry indexes the majority of its pricing in emerging markets to movements in foreign exchange rates. For example, in Brazil, while actual invoicing is done in Brazilian reais, the invoice amount is indexed back to hard currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar. On a predetermined basis, prices are adjusted up or down to reflect the underlying movements of currency and the product profile. When reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency neutral sales growth calculation. This is different from our competition. 
In Q3, adjusting our currency neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to how our competition reports, our currency neutral sales growth would have increased to approximately 3% organically and 4% inclusive of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. On a 2-year basis, to factor in the year-ago performance, organic currency neutral sales would have increased to an average of 4.5%, which is ahead of our largest competitor by approximately 150 basis points. 
From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit was down 4% year-over-year, principally due to year-over-year decline in gross margin, and I'll walk you through that in greater detail in a moment. We benefited from a lower year-over-year shares outstanding and a more favorable tax rate that helped offset the impact of our operating performance on a currency neutral adjusted EPS basis.
Looking at our Q3 currency neutral operating profit results, I want to provide more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you see the contribution of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to the likes of formula optimization, indirect procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies in both compounds businesses, we delivered approximately 6 percentage point benefit year-over-year to overall profitability. In the third bar, you can see that growth added approximately 5% to profitability. 
From a headwind perspective, there are several items that we need -- I need to elaborate on. In the fourth bar, RSA expenses represented approximately a 5 percentage point drag on operating profit. It should be noted that this includes approximately 3 percentage points related to planned investments that we mentioned earlier in the year and another 1 percentage point in compliance and litigation-related costs. The strategic investments, while they challenge profitability in the short term, are expected to yield P&L leverage in the years to come. 
The greatest gap to our previous guidance came in the form of weaker sales mix. Beverages, our highest margin category in Flavors, had limited growth in the quarter, while Savory, a less profitable category, performed very well, growing high single digits. On the Fragrance side, we experienced a similar dynamic, with Fine Fragrances, a strong margin category, declining year-over-year, while we experienced growth for the first time in approximately 2 years in our Fragrance Ingredients business, which is a less profitable category. Net-net, this led to an unfavorable sales mix, which represented a 3% drag to operating profit.
In addition, we were also pressured by year-over-year manufacturing performance, principally related to manufacturing yields in our Fragrance Ingredient manufacturing network. Rounding out our performance, price and input costs in other and miscellaneous items, including the year-over change in incentive compensation, were the remaining headwinds.
Turning to our business unit performance for the third quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, driven by mid-single digit growth in Savory, Dairy and Sweet. From a regional perspective, growth was led by high single-digit increases in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. North American results were challenged, reflecting low single-digit growth in Savory and Sweet that was offset by softness in Beverage. 
Europe, Africa and Middle East increased 5% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Savory and Sweet. Africa and the Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double digits in the current third quarter. Greater Asia posted 5% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in India, Asia, Indonesia and China, which returned to growth after several quarters of decline, partly due to the manufacturing order issues that we saw in early 2015. We're happy to see this business is stabilizing and returning to growth as the order issue is behind us. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved double-digit growth in both Beverage and Dairy.
Growth in Latin America rebounded, improving 7% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in both Brazil and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit was challenged as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price to input costs and increases in RSA.
Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2%, including approximately 1 percentage point associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Growth was led by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was challenged. On a currency neutral basis, had strong double-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in North America was more than offset by softness in Latin America and Western Europe. 
It should be noted that we believe that a part of our softness in Fine Fragrance can be attributed to a large Fine Fragrance customer who is also going -- who is going through a portfolio transition via divestiture. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by high single-digit increase in Greater Asia and mid-single-digit growth in North America. 
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, driven by low single-digit growth on an organic basis and the contribution of sales related to IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral sales profit declined as volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price and input costs, manufacturing performances and increases in RSA.
From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow improved 12% versus the same period in 2015. Our operating cash flow was 14% of sales, up from 12.8% in the first 9 months of 2015. This change was driven by our core working capital levels improving versus year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivable. 
In terms of capital deployment, capital expenditures through the first 9 months totaled $70 million, and we are on track to spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will be principally driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions. 
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders, during the first 9 months of 2016, we spent approximately $134 million on dividends and $94 million on share repurchases. This puts us on target to deliver on our commitment to return 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
As we finish up 2016, we expect business trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. We expect stronger currency neutral top line growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by improvements in both Flavors and Fragrances and the benefits of our acquisition of David Michael. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that David Michael will add about 200 basis points to currency neutral sales growth in Q4 while providing limited benefits on an operating profit basis, given the increase in purchase price accounting impacts. 
From a currency neutral operating profit basis, growth is expected to strengthen in the fourth quarter. And while we do expect pressure on gross margins to continue, given the sales mix dynamics we discussed earlier, we believe that improvement in volume trends and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives will drive operating profit growth year-over-year. This compares as we compare to our largest year-over-year quarterly reset in incentive comp during the fourth quarter last year. 
The combination of this currency neutral operating profit performance, plus lower shares outstanding and some benefits in our effective tax rate, is expected to lead growth in currency neutral EPS also.
Upon entering 2016, we expected challenging conditions, given the high level of economic uncertainty and a more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. As evident in today's marketplace, this is indeed the case as volume consumption remains challenged across many end market categories, and economic volatility and visibility in key markets around the world remains challenging. We acknowledge that we are slightly lowering the previous guidance we provided earlier this year. Nevertheless, the viability of our business remains strong, and we expect to deliver growth across all of our key financial metrics on a currency neutral basis. 
For the full year, we see currency neutral sales improving 4% to 5% versus 2015, with broad-based contributions from organic and inorganic business. Currency neutral operating profit is expected to go up 3.5% to 4.5%, in large part due to benefits of cost and productivity improvements, increased volumes and the benefits of acquisitions.
It should be noted that inclusive in our guidance is approximately 3 percentage points of litigation and compliance-related costs as well as planned strategic investments made over the course of 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these investments are intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the years to come. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we expect the modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of share repurchase program to lead to 5% to 6% improvement on an EPS basis.
In terms of foreign exchange, we have tweaked the impact of currency on our guidance as it is slightly more favorable. On a sales basis, we expect currency to impact results by approximately 1.5 percentage points, and for our adjusted operating profit and EPS, we expect a 2 percentage point impact. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Andreas."

So I guess, how should we think about that dynamic in the fourth quarter, but also into 2017 and beyond?

We believe that the emerging markets will eventually come back. Also, the currency situation here was challenging for us. And we're diversifying our portfolio as well.

Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy.

Then I will provide some concluding remarks, and we will be finished by taking any questions that you may have.
In the third quarter, currency neutral sales grew 3%, led by an improved performance in Flavors, plus approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both business units, along with increased volumes in Fragrance Ingredients. 
On a currency neutral operating profit perspective, we expected quarter 3 performance to be muted given the timing of planned investments, yet results came in softer than expected. This is largely attributed to lower-than-expected gross margin performance. Rich will provide more details in a moment. 
As a result, currency neutral adjusted EPS in quarter 3 was challenged despite the benefits from lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program and a more favorable effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first 9 months of 2016 improved 4%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. 
Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3%, driven by sales growth, benefits of our productivity initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions. It should be noted that this is inclusive of approximately 3 percentage points of planned strategic investments as well as litigation and compliance-related costs made over the course of 2016. A portion of this investment is intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the future. 
This, combined with lower shares outstanding and a more favorable effective tax rate, had a positive effect on our currency neutral adjusted EPS, which increased 5% in the first 9 months of 2016.
Reviewing our progress against our Vision 2020 ambition, we continued to achieve strong results in the key areas that we've identified as strategic priorities for us: encapsulation, modulation, North America, Africa and the Middle East, to name a few. From innovating first perspective in Flavors, sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit growth, currency neutral growth across all categories. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales of Personal Wash and Home Care improved strong double digits in a currency neutral basis, demonstrating that our technology is starting to gain traction in areas outside of Fabric Care. In the third quarter, we also launched 4 new flavor molecules in the key tonalities of citrus, onion and garlic to help our flavors continue to build consumer-preferred products that perform in the marketplace. 
In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently commercialized a new captive fragrance ingredient called Saffiano to further drive differentiation. This particular fragrance ingredient is a strong, rich, natural leather, with powdery, soft, sweet quality, providing a unique more interest, and is very additive to many fragrance creations. It enhances strength and increases the facets in fragrance, of course, by providing a very clean, natural effect. 
The combination of the 2 molecules we have released so far this year, plus the 2 we expect to commercialize in the fourth quarter, puts us on track to double our annual fragrance molecule output average from 2 per year to 4 per year. In addition to this expansion, we have also adjusted our commercial fragrance ingredient strategy to release these types of captive molecules to the external market sooner to accelerate value creation.
In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, our growth has accelerated. Our strong growth momentum in the Middle East and Africa continued in the third quarter as currency neutral sales improved strong double digit, with both businesses achieving very strong growth. In North America Fragrance, we saw 6% increase for the third quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in Fabric Care. This was led by our encapsulation platform as we continue to leverage this technology to gain market share. Another strategic area for us is Home Care, grew low single digits on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia.
We also continued to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth global consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality of products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both local and faster-growing regional accounts, with regionals outpacing global accounts. This should strengthen as our acquisition of Ottens Flavors and more recently, David Michael, and Fragrance Resources, the one we announced our intention to purchase last week, are all very strong from their regional customer basis.
We are also collaborating with Delos and Mayo Clinic to be a part of their Well Being Lab (sic) [ Well Living Lab ], which is a new research facility dedicated to understanding the impacts between health and well-being and indoor environments through human-centered research. This world-class living lab leverages and expands upon the principles of the well-building standard, which focuses on 7 concepts relevant to indoor health: air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort and mind. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise in scent to help improve the lives of individuals.
In the third quarter, we also became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum. As pioneers of the senses for more than 127 years, we embrace this unique opportunity to exchange ideas with other leading organizations who are interested in making positive, lasting changes in society. This collaboration with a formal alliance was IFF's Vision 2020's strategy, which underscores how we are as a company and businesses in general can innovate in the area of artistry, science, technology and sustainability to produce positive results for both business and society.
I'm also proud to be elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. I'm extremely excited to represent IFF and about our journey as an organization to help leave the world a better place for generations to come.
We continued our trend of strengthening and expanding our portfolio by accelerating our efforts in M&A, with the addition of approximately USD 160 million in expected annualized sales on the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, both of which complement our strategic vision well. I will speak in more detail about each of these acquisitions in a moment. 
I'm happy to report that IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continues to perform well, achieving double-digit growth on a standalone basis. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long term, value-creating opportunities.
Turning to our more recent acquisition announcements. David Michael is a privately-held flavors company headquartered in Philadelphia. The company is well known in the industry for its vanilla expertise, strength in dairy and beverage categories and the relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle-market customers. David Michael complements our Ottens Flavors acquisition from last year by strengthening our ability to serve the faster-growing mid-market customers in North America and solidifies our strong #1 position in Flavors North America, a strategic priority for us. 
The deal, which closed on October 7, is expected to add approximately USD 85 million of sales in 2017 and expected to be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. This bolt-on acquisition is another important milestone in IFF's Vision 2020, helping us win where we compete in the world's largest flavor market as we look to further accelerate growth.
Late last week, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Fragrance Resources, a privately-held, family-owned fragrance company who, for nearly 30 years, has distinguished itself, exceptional creative talent and quality service to faster-growing regional customers. This highly complementary bolt-on acquisition further will increase our penetration in specialty fragrances, a faster-growing subcategory within Fine Fragrances, and is expected to strengthen our market share position with a regional customer base within the key markets of North America and Germany. 
Fragrance Resources is expected to add about USD 75 million of sales in 2017 and is also be EPS accretive in year 1 and economic profit breakeven between years 3 and year 5. Right now, we expect an early 2017 close, and we look forward to welcoming Fragrance Resources to IFF.
The combination of both acquisitions is expected to contribute approximately 4.5 percentage points to our currency neutral sales growth in 2017. This, plus expected cost synergy benefits, will lead to greater financial performance in the years to come. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich."

Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growing 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a con",1754,"Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growing 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited from approximately 1 percentage point related to the contribution of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition. On an organic basis, we grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. 
I want to provide you with greater insight with respect to our performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing for Q3. As a reminder, our industry indexes the majority of its pricing in emerging markets to movements in foreign exchange rates. For example, in Brazil, while actual invoicing is done in Brazilian reais, the invoice amount is indexed back to hard currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar. On a predetermined basis, prices are adjusted up or down to reflect the underlying movements of currency and the product profile. When reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency neutral sales growth calculation. This is different from our competition. 
In Q3, adjusting our currency neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to how our competition reports, our currency neutral sales growth would have increased to approximately 3% organically and 4% inclusive of the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. On a 2-year basis, to factor in the year-ago performance, organic currency neutral sales would have increased to an average of 4.5%, which is ahead of our largest competitor by approximately 150 basis points. 
From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit was down 4% year-over-year, principally due to year-over-year decline in gross margin, and I'll walk you through that in greater detail in a moment. We benefited from a lower year-over-year shares outstanding and a more favorable tax rate that helped offset the impact of our operating performance on a currency neutral adjusted EPS basis.
Looking at our Q3 currency neutral operating profit results, I want to provide more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you see the contribution of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to the likes of formula optimization, indirect procurement savings and manufacturing efficiencies in both compounds businesses, we delivered approximately 6 percentage point benefit year-over-year to overall profitability. In the third bar, you can see that growth added approximately 5% to profitability. 
From a headwind perspective, there are several items that we need -- I need to elaborate on. In the fourth bar, RSA expenses represented approximately a 5 percentage point drag on operating profit. It should be noted that this includes approximately 3 percentage points related to planned investments that we mentioned earlier in the year and another 1 percentage point in compliance and litigation-related costs. The strategic investments, while they challenge profitability in the short term, are expected to yield P&L leverage in the years to come. 
The greatest gap to our previous guidance came in the form of weaker sales mix. Beverages, our highest margin category in Flavors, had limited growth in the quarter, while Savory, a less profitable category, performed very well, growing high single digits. On the Fragrance side, we experienced a similar dynamic, with Fine Fragrances, a strong margin category, declining year-over-year, while we experienced growth for the first time in approximately 2 years in our Fragrance Ingredients business, which is a less profitable category. Net-net, this led to an unfavorable sales mix, which represented a 3% drag to operating profit.
In addition, we were also pressured by year-over-year manufacturing performance, principally related to manufacturing yields in our Fragrance Ingredient manufacturing network. Rounding out our performance, price and input costs in other and miscellaneous items, including the year-over change in incentive compensation, were the remaining headwinds.
Turning to our business unit performance for the third quarter. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, driven by mid-single digit growth in Savory, Dairy and Sweet. From a regional perspective, growth was led by high single-digit increases in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. North American results were challenged, reflecting low single-digit growth in Savory and Sweet that was offset by softness in Beverage. 
Europe, Africa and Middle East increased 5% on a currency neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Savory and Sweet. Africa and the Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double digits in the current third quarter. Greater Asia posted 5% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in India, Asia, Indonesia and China, which returned to growth after several quarters of decline, partly due to the manufacturing order issues that we saw in early 2015. We're happy to see this business is stabilizing and returning to growth as the order issue is behind us. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved double-digit growth in both Beverage and Dairy.
Growth in Latin America rebounded, improving 7% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in both Brazil and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit was challenged as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price to input costs and increases in RSA.
Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2%, including approximately 1 percentage point associated with the acquisition of IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Growth was led by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was challenged. On a currency neutral basis, had strong double-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in North America was more than offset by softness in Latin America and Western Europe. 
It should be noted that we believe that a part of our softness in Fine Fragrance can be attributed to a large Fine Fragrance customer who is also going -- who is going through a portfolio transition via divestiture. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by high single-digit increase in Greater Asia and mid-single-digit growth in North America. 
Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, driven by low single-digit growth on an organic basis and the contribution of sales related to IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral sales profit declined as volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price and input costs, manufacturing performances and increases in RSA.
From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow improved 12% versus the same period in 2015. Our operating cash flow was 14% of sales, up from 12.8% in the first 9 months of 2015. This change was driven by our core working capital levels improving versus year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivable. 
In terms of capital deployment, capital expenditures through the first 9 months totaled $70 million, and we are on track to spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will be principally driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions. 
Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders, during the first 9 months of 2016, we spent approximately $134 million on dividends and $94 million on share repurchases. This puts us on target to deliver on our commitment to return 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.
As we finish up 2016, we expect business trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. We expect stronger currency neutral top line growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by improvements in both Flavors and Fragrances and the benefits of our acquisition of David Michael. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that David Michael will add about 200 basis points to currency neutral sales growth in Q4 while providing limited benefits on an operating profit basis, given the increase in purchase price accounting impacts. 
From a currency neutral operating profit basis, growth is expected to strengthen in the fourth quarter. And while we do expect pressure on gross margins to continue, given the sales mix dynamics we discussed earlier, we believe that improvement in volume trends and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives will drive operating profit growth year-over-year. This compares as we compare to our largest year-over-year quarterly reset in incentive comp during the fourth quarter last year. 
The combination of this currency neutral operating profit performance, plus lower shares outstanding and some benefits in our effective tax rate, is expected to lead growth in currency neutral EPS also.
Upon entering 2016, we expected challenging conditions, given the high level of economic uncertainty and a more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. As evident in today's marketplace, this is indeed the case as volume consumption remains challenged across many end market categories, and economic volatility and visibility in key markets around the world remains challenging. We acknowledge that we are slightly lowering the previous guidance we provided earlier this year. Nevertheless, the viability of our business remains strong, and we expect to deliver growth across all of our key financial metrics on a currency neutral basis. 
For the full year, we see currency neutral sales improving 4% to 5% versus 2015, with broad-based contributions from organic and inorganic business. Currency neutral operating profit is expected to go up 3.5% to 4.5%, in large part due to benefits of cost and productivity improvements, increased volumes and the benefits of acquisitions.
It should be noted that inclusive in our guidance is approximately 3 percentage points of litigation and compliance-related costs as well as planned strategic investments made over the course of 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these investments are intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the years to come. 
From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we expect the modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of share repurchase program to lead to 5% to 6% improvement on an EPS basis.
In terms of foreign exchange, we have tweaked the impact of currency on our guidance as it is slightly more favorable. On a sales basis, we expect currency to impact results by approximately 1.5 percentage points, and for our adjusted operating profit and EPS, we expect a 2 percentage point impact. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Andreas."

I think a little bit more favorable too than expectations going in at the beginning of the year. So I guess, I'm curious your thoughts from here about anticipated productivity initiatives and reinvestment. As I recall in June last year, you had talked about anticipation of reinvestment being net neutral versus productivity initiatives, and now it's obviously more favorable. So I guess, how should we think about that dynamic in the fourth quarter, but also into 2017 and beyond? And sort of what level of productivity initiatives are now required to grow EBITDA in line with those long-term targets?"

We believe that the emerging markets will eventually come back. Also, the currency situation here was challenging for us. And we're diversifying our portfolio as well.

One, you saw in the Q that we have a case going on and we're actively pursuing that and vigorously defending that, but that costs money. And as we prepare for trial, potential trial early next year, we're getting prepared around. That's a piece of it. The bigger piece of that is really related to the reach requirements in the Fragrance business, and it goes through a cycle where there's another -- the next cycle is in 2018, and so we have to prepare for the registrations now. When we incur costs this year, we incur again next year. And then the following year, potentially we get a little bit of money back from other companies that use our products. But that's -- it's really the registration and compliance costs associated with our materials that we operate within the European environment."
