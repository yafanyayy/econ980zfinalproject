The year holding started the year with a strong first quarter, setting us for a great 2016. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $241 million from $2.4 billion of revenue and our pretax operating margin improved 40 basis points to 10%.
Our home selling increased 9% compared to the first quarter of last year due to improved absorptions. These results reflect the solid performance of our core communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term.

With your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and our position within it, I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still imply a very low ratio relative to revenues, which is essentially you're basically barely replenishing what you're burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I were disappointed. But that does still, it sound to me even though you're calculating in terms to make it sound like you're leaning forward on land investment, it actually isn't. It sounds to me like on balance, you are being relatively judicious, very judicious, actually, historically in your land spend next year. And so, I guess, I'm curious as to touching on what you said in the past. What you intend to do with the cash that you are going to be building here over the course of the next year.

With your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and your position within it, I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still imply a very low ratio relative to revenues, which is just essentially you're basically, barely replenishing what you're burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I were disappointed. But that does still, it sound to me even though you're counting that in it -- in terms to make it sound like you're sort of leaning forward on land investment, it actually isn't. It sounds to me like on balance, you are being relatively judicious, very judicious, actually, historically in your land spend next year.

But we're definitely taking a balanced approach and keeping the investment levels within a disciplined range, and with that,  that's definitely generating a lot of cash flow. As far as how we look at our cash position today, we've talked a bit about our debt maturities. To the extent the market is favorable, we would still issue new debt. The refinance rates are still certainly very attractive and we continue to look for investments in our business. If we see great investments that would push our land spending up to 25% or 30%, we feel like it generates a great return, we will do that. And as Mike has already talked about, M&A, there are a lot of opportunities. And then hopefully, there will be some come along that meet our threshold and this cash position puts us in a great, flexible opportunistic position to be able to take advantage of that.

So we didn't see a further slowdown in Houston, but we're also not seeing any meaningful pickup. We continue to see our lower priced Express homes, very steady demands, steady sales pace. But as has been mentioned a couple of times on the call, definitely softer at the higher end. But we continue to see good steady demand for the entry-level and people moving out of apartments where we're providing an attractive rent versus buy equation and driving people into the sales offices each week. So we continue to have a close eye on Houston. We're not heavily reinvesting in Houston right now. We are replenishing where it makes sense and where we can continue to add those entry-level product offerings."

Our D.R. Horton team started the year with a strong first quarter, setting us up for a great 2016. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $241 million from $2.4 billion of revenue, and our pretax operating margin improved 40 basis points to 10%.
Our homes sold increased 9% compared to the first quarter of last year due to improved absorptions. These results reflect the solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. 
With a sales backlog of 10,665 homes at the end of December, positive sales trends in January and a well-stocked supply of land, plots homes, we are well-positioned for the spring selling season and for 2016. Bill?"

And then touching back on this interesting juxtaposition of strong cash flow generation next year, which is an unusual thing and usually doesn't happen early in a cycle. With your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and your position within it, I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still imply a very low ratio relative to revenues, which is just essentially you're basically barely replenishing what you're burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I was disappointed. But that does still, it sounds to me even though you're couching that in terms to make it sounds like you're sort of leaning forward on land investment, it actually isn't. It sounds to me like on balance, you are being relatively judicious, very judicious, actually, historically in your land spend next year. And so, I guess, I'm curious as to touching on what you've said in the past. What you intend to do with the cash that you are going to be building here over the course of the next year. Do you, for instance, envision using that more for debt paydown, share repurchases, M&A over the course of the next 2 to 3 years?"

First, to your comment about us replenishing our land supply, we feel very good about the level of our land supply in terms of what we own. And we are -- the 20% or greater spend that we are essentially expecting, does replenish our land supply. And we felt like it's at a sufficient level to support the growth expectations and guidance that we have provided. But we're definitely taking a balanced approach and keeping the investment levels within a disciplined range, and with that, that's definitely generating a lot of cash flow. As far as how we look at our cash position today, we've talked a bit about our debt maturities. To the extent the market is favorable, we would still issue new debt. The refinance rates are still certainly very attractive and we continue to look for investments in our business. If we see great investments that would push our land spending up to 25% or 30%, we feel like it generates a great return, we will do that. And as Mike has already talked about, M&A, there are a lot of opportunities. And hopefully, there will be some coming along that meet our threshold and this cash position puts us in a great, flexible opportunistic position to be able to take advantage of that. And so today, in terms of priorities, we would list investing in our business, which would include potential M&A, taking care of our debt maturities along the way as our top priorities.

Our D.R. Horton team started the year with a strong first quarter, setting us up for a great 2016. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $241 million from $2.4 billion of revenue, and our pretax operating margin improved 40 basis points to 10%.
Our homes sold increased 9% compared to the first quarter of last year due to improved absorptions. These results reflect the solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns.

And then touching back on this interesting juxtaposition of strong cash flow generation next year, which is an unusual thing and usually doesn't happen early in a cycle. With your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and your position within it, I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still imply a very low ratio relative to revenues, which is just essentially you're basically barely replenishing what you're burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I was disappointed. But that does still, it sounds to me even though you're couching that in terms to make it sounds like you're sort of leaning forward on land investment, it actually isn't.

The refinance rates are still certainly very attractive and we continue to look for investments in our business.

We are replenishing where it makes sense and where we can continue to add those entry-level product offerings."

Our consolidated pretax income increased to $301 million, on $2.8 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%.

We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns.
During the 6-months ended March, we generated $27 million cash from operations, on-track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pretax income divided by average inventory improved to 13.8% for the 12-months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well stock supply of land, lots and homes, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2016. Mike?"

The spring selling season at D.R. Horton is in full swing, and our team delivered a -- set a strong second quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $301 million on $2.8 billion of revenue and our pretax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%. Our homes sold increased 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by improving absorptions. These results continue to reflect the consistent solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns.
During the 6 months ended March, we generated $27 million of cash from operations, on track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pretax income divided by average inventory improved to 13.8% for the 12-months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well-stock supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2016.

The spring selling season at D.R. Horton is in full swing, and our team delivered a  strong second quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $301 million on $2.8 billion of revenue, and our pretax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%. Our homes sold increased 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by improving absorptions. These results continue to reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns.
During the 6 months ended March, we generated $27 million of cash from operations, on track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pretax income divided by average inventory improved to 13.8% for the 12 months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2016.

Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest cost.
As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest cost.

The spring selling season at D.R. Horton is in full swing, and our team delivered a  strong second quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $301 million on $2.8 billion of revenue, and our pretax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%. Our homes sold increased 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by improving absorptions. These results continue to reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our 3 brands over the long term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns.
During the 6 months ended March, we generated $27 million of cash from operations, on track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pretax income divided by average inventory improved to 13.8% for the 12 months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2016.

The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to third quarter of 2015 as we continue to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. 
Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the 9 months into June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. 
With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter and next year.

The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to third quarter of 2015 as we continue to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. 
Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the 9 months into June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. 
With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year.

But as we expect to grow top line double digit, we should expect to lever SG&A further as well. And so yes, this does imply we will get down below 9% and there's not a magic floor there. And each year, if we expect to grow, we would expect to continue to push some more SG&A leverage. Certainly, some of the other things that have been talked about among other builders, we're doing a lot of those things as well. We're certainly taking advantage of technology wherever we can. We're looking to be -- to drive ways to be more efficient in all areas of our business. But there's not one magic bullet. There is -- we're looking to do -- get more efficient on every line of our financials. And certainly, those things are part of it as well."

The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to third quarter of 2015 as we continued to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. 
Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the 9 months into June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. 
With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year.

And so as we begin to look forward the next several quarters, next 18 months or so, we really do have good visibility and confidence level to be able to deliver consistently at a double-digit pace on the revenue line, continue to drive some additional SG&A leverage to improve our operating margin and improve our returns. And so we felt like it was appropriate to start to get some preliminary guidance to next year as we did last year at this time for fiscal '16. And certainly, we've been pleased that we've essentially delivered on that preliminary guidance thus far this year."

And we feel good about -- with the range of the guidance we're giving on the margins, that's a defensible position for us going forward as we continue to drive absorptions community by community.

The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to third quarter of 2015 as we continued to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. 
Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the 9 months into June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. 
With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year.

The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to third quarter of 2015 as we continued to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent, solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. 
Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the 9 months into June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. 
With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year.

During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated from operations to $618 million for the year and to $1.3 billion over the past 2 years.

For the year, we delivered results in line with our original guidance we shared last summer, with consolidated pretax income increasing 20% to $1.4 billion on $12.2 billion of revenue. We closed 40,309 homes this year, which is an increase of 3,661 homes or 10% over last year. Our consolidated pretax margin for the full year of 2016 improved 70 basis points to 11.1%. Our return on inventory improved 260 basis points in 2016 to 15.4%. During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated from operations to $618 million for the year and to $1.3 billion over the past 2 years. These results reflect consistent strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our continued strategic focus is to produce this double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and improved returns. With a sales backlog of 11,475 homes at the end of September; positive sales trends in October and well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes; and the launch of our Freedom Homes brand, we are well positioned and looking forward to 2017.

During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated from operations to $618 million for the year and to $1.3 billion over the past 2 years. These results reflect consistent strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our continued strategic focus is to produce this double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and improved returns.

Horton brand communities, just because assuming that the Horton -- sorry, the Express communities have a bit quicker cycle times, could you just explain a bit of this mix to us and what do you expect trending into '17?"

Looking at labor, certainly, labor is tight across the markets. We feel that our market positioning, the leading market positions that we have give us access to great labor partners, and we're able to provide a lot of work for those. As David mentioned before, running a consistent absorption space, community by community, helps us in negotiating and giving that labor a secured place to go to work every day. But we do hear that our guys are working very hard every day to secure adequate labor, provide quality homes. And we monitor our build times brand by brand. And we  -- that would be the best way, we would have to see if we were having a global impact of labor shortages in our deliveries, and we're not seeing our build times really lengthen our cycle times extend for how long it takes us to build a house. So we're very pleased. Our guys are doing a great job and gals are doing a great job performing in that regard."

Our D.R. Horton team finished strong in 2016. Pretax income for the fourth quarter increased 28% to $433 million on $3.7 billion of revenue. And our pretax operating margin improved 90 basis points to 11.6%. For the year, we delivered results in line with our original guidance we shared last summer, with consolidated pretax income increasing 20% to $1.4 billion on $12.2 billion of revenue. We closed 40,309 homes this year, which is an increase of 3,661 homes or 10% over last year. Our consolidated pretax margin for the full year of 2016 improved 70 basis points to 11.1%. Our return on inventory improved 260 basis points in 2016 to 15.4%. During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated from operations to $618 million for the year and to $1.3 billion over the past 2 years. These results reflect consistent strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our continued strategic focus is to produce this double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and improved returns. With a sales backlog of 11,475 homes at the end of September; positive sales trends in October and well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes; and the launch of our Freedom Homes brand, we are well positioned and looking forward to 2017.
