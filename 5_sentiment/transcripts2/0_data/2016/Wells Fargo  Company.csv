Our strong performance in 2015 reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our focus on the real economy. Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad-based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion of auto loans, almost $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers, who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle markets loans and $29 billion of Commercial Real Estate loans. We are active in facilitating the payments that drive economic activity across the country with over $280 billion of debit card purchase volume, $70 billion of consumer credit card purchase volume and $25 billion of commercial cards spend volume in 2015. We also contributed to the communities we serve in many other ways that are not directly reflected in our financial results, but are just as important to our success. For example, we've had the nations #1 United Way Campaign for 6 consecutive years.
Let me highlight a few of our other accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.15. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit results continued to be very strong with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year. However, since we did not have any reserve release in the second half of the year, our provision expense increased $1 billion compared with a year ago. Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders. O,ur fifth consecutive year of increased returns. The returned $12.6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to the economic environment. While parts of the global economy have continued to experience stress and the markets have reacted negatively in the early weeks of 2016, domestic economic conditions remain generally favorable. As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S.-centric company and the strength and diversity of the U.S. economy benefited our results in 2015. The economy continues to advance, with strong job creation, including 70 consecutive months of gains in private payrolls, the longest run ever recorded. While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power cost, which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes. 
Auto vehicle sales were the best ever in 2015 and Wells Fargo originated a record number of auto loans during the year. If gas prices continue to remain low, 2016 should be another strong year for the auto market. The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6%, helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago. While December housing data is not yet available, 2015 appears to be the best year for home sales and housing starts since 2007. Inventories of homers for sale remain historically low, providing a tailwind for building activity into 2016. 
Commercial Real Estate appreciation has been even stronger than consumer real estate and vacancy rates, where nearly all property types continue to decline. For apartments, vacancy rates are at historic lows, which should benefit both construction activity and pricing in 2016. 
Finally, the building blocks of our long-term growth and increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success. I'm excited about our opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customers' financial needs. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results. John?"

While our fourth quarter e",2988,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as the year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and a gain from the sale of our government-guaranteed student loan portfolio. Our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with a year ago, we continue to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit, we had positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans, and we continue to have strong liquidity and capital levels. 
Now let me highlight these key drivers in more detail.  On Page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share. These results are even more impressive when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2015, while we continue to invest in our business. For example, loan-loss reserve releases declined from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $450 million in 2015. The sustained low rate environment and our disciplined redeployment of our strong deposit growth reduced our margin by 12 basis points. We continue to invest in risk management-related activities and these expenses were up 12% compared with 2014. We strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity and capital levels.
Turning to Page 4. We grew earning assets of 3% from third quarter with loans, short-term investments and investment securities all increasing. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt increased $14.3 billion with $17.8 billion of issuances, including debt related to funding the previously announced GE Capital acquisitions. The debt we issued in the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about 8 years at a cost of approximately 3 months LIBOR plus 70 basis points. However, $10.5 billion of these issuances have a shorter maturity and become eligible for prepayment during the first half of '16. By beginning to prefund the GE Capital acquisitions, we are able to maintain our strong liquidity position and our healthy level of dry powder to fund perspective balance sheet growth, while retaining the flexibility to prepay a significant portion of the debt should we determine it is no longer needed.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined to $289 million from the third quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income, primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now achieved year-over-year loan growth for 18 consecutive quarters. Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or a dollars [ph] or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.3 billion and consumer loans grew $6.1 billion from third quarter. We did not acquire any loan portfolios in the fourth quarter so the linked-quarter growth was all organic. The GE Capital transactions that we announced last quarter will start to be reflected in our first quarter results. The GE Railcar Services transaction, with  $4.1 billion of loans and leases closed on January 1, making us the largest rail car operating lessor in North America. We anticipate the North American base portion about 90% of the approximately $31 billion of assets we expect to acquire from GE Capital to close late in the first quarter, with the remainder expected to close in the second quarter. We're looking forward to having many talented and experienced people from these businesses join our team. Page 20 in the appendix has additional updates on these transactions.
On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $28.1 billion or 10% from a year ago. The growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit growth in Commercial Real Estate, asset-backed finance, Corporate Banking, Equipment Finance, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth and high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.2 billion or 8% from last year. We continue to benefit from the strong auto market, while we remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $3.3 billion or 9% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points, down 1 basis point from a year ago and stable with third quarter. We stated that we believe deposit betas will be lower at least initially during this rate cycle and lower than they had been in past periods of rising rates. Indications since the rate move in December support this, however, we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers, while maintaining our disciplined relationship-based pricing strategy. This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth with primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8%.  Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Page 9 highlights Wells Fargo's revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Over the past year, as we've benefited from a balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4%, while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with the year ago. As a result, net interest income generated just over half of our revenue in the fourth quarter.
We grew net interest income $408 million from a year ago even as the net interest margin declined 12 basis points. The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held for sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the third quarter. Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by a customer-driven deposit growth, which reduced the margin by 3 basis points that have a minimal impact on net interest income. All of the other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances, including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call. 
We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income, which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth even in the challenging rate environment during 2015. On a full year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015 in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth. If there are additional rate increases during 2016, [ph] we would expect our net interest income growth for 2016 to be higher than the 4% growth rate we achieved in 2015.
Total noninterest income declined $420 million from third quarter, primarily driven by lower equity gains. Gains from equity investments were $423 million in the fourth quarter, which were in line with the quarterly average over the past 2 years. Equity gains declined 6% in the full year 2015 compared with 2014, and considering the current market conditions in our pipeline, we would expect continued declines in 2016. The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results and capital markets-related businesses, including Investment Banking and trading, and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses, including retail brokerage, asset management and trust. 
We had linked-quarter growth in a number of our businesses, including Investment Banking, card fees, Commercial Real Estate brokerage and Mortgage Banking. Mortgage Banking revenue increased $71 million from third quarter. Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago, benefiting from a stronger housing market. We ended the quarter with a $29 billion application pipeline, down 15% from third quarter, but up 12% from a year ago. Our production margin on residential, held-for-sale mortgage originations was 183 basis points in the fourth quarter, down from 188 basis points in the third quarter. Mortgage origination revenue in the fourth quarter benefited from $128 million repurchased reserve release as we resolved certain exposures and revised liability assumptions. Higher mortgage origination revenue also reflected stronger multifamily mortgage activity in the fourth quarter.
Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period and interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of warranty solutions last quarter, which benefited third quarter income. There are also a few linked quarter changes in some fee categories that were not driven by business activity. Merchant processing fees as reported declined $182 million linked quarter. These fees are now reported in other income as results of accounting change, which was P&L neutral. The increasing gains from trading activities this quarter was due to higher deferred compensation gains, which are offset in employee benefits, and they are also P&L neutral.
As shown on Page 12, expenses were stable with the third quarter and we remain focused on expense management. There are a few items to highlight that impacted the linked-quarter trend in some specific categories. The increase in employee benefits expense reflected $319 million of higher deferred comp expense, which was primarily offset in trading revenue. Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from the lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Also, third quarter expenses included $126 million  contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $181 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals outside professional services increased $164 million, which included higher project-related spending. Advertising expenses were also elevated, up $49 million. While these typically higher fourth quarter expense should be lower next quarter, as usual, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. 
Our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the full year 2015, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter. We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them exceptional customer service. In fact, we were ranked #1 in customer satisfaction in the National Bank category according to the 2015 American Customer Satisfaction Index. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Debit card purchase volume was $73 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago; and credit card purchase volume was $18.9 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Our credit card penetration in Retail Banking households increased to 43.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 41.5% a year ago. We received the highest-ranking and corporate insight assessment of credit card issuer rewards redemption options, and just this week, we launch of the new American Express card with no annual fee. Our customers are also increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 7% and active mobile customers up 14% from a year ago. To better support our customers to grow their companies, we've moved business banking and merchant payment services, which were previously included within Community Banking, to Wholesale Banking. For comparative purposes, prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this realignment.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from year ago and up 9% from third quarter. The linked quarter both reflected higher net interest and noninterest income. The increase in fee income driven by Investment Banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volker as well as Commercial Real Estate-related businesses such as, E-still Secured our Commercial Real Estate brokerage and advisory business, multifamily capital and structured real estate. Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposits grew 6% from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our deposit pricing for our wholesale customers and we were focused on relationship-based pricing for both deposits and loans.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $595 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from a year ago and down 2% from third quarter. Growth from a year ago is driven by positive operating leverage with expenses down 2% and revenue up 1%. Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 15% from a year ago. Average deposits grew 7% [ph] from a year ago and average loans grew 15%, the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings, including high-quality, nonconforming mortgage loans, commercial loans and security-based lending. Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations, which were partially offset by positive flows.
Turning to Page 16. Credit quality remained strong, demonstrated the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Our net charge-off rate was 36 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter, an seasonally higher consumer losses. The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios, which are at 36% of our loans outstanding, continue to benefit from the improving housing market. 
Nonperforming assets have declined for 13 consecutive quarters and were down $497 million from third quarter, driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and the $342 million reduction in foreclosed assets. Oil and gas loan accruals were $843 million, up $277 million from third quarter. However, as of year-end, over 90% of our nonaccrual  oil and gas loans were current on interest payments. We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio. Total loans in our oil and gas portfolio were down 6% from a year ago and are now less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We continue to work closely with our customers and are mondering market conditions, and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014. However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge, and at current price levels, we would expect another higher oil and gas losses in 2016. We've considered the challenges within the energy sector and our allowance process throughout 2015 and approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. It's important to note that the entire allowances available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. We've also considered the impact of lower energy prices on our debt and equity securities portfolio and had approximately $130 million of OTTI-related write-downs in our energy-related holdings in the quarter.
Turning to Page 17. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio, fully phased-in at 10.7% in the fourth quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers in our internal -- and buffers -- regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us well for the acquisitions we announced in 2015 and returning more capital to shareholders. We returned $3.2 billion or shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio is 59%.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings. We continued to invest in our businesses, grew capital and liquidity and maintained a strong risk culture. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and expect our customer base to grow both organically and through acquisitions, including from the customers and platforms we are acquiring from GE Capital in 2016. We remain focused on satisfying our new and existing customers' financial needs.

All of the other ones are performing. In terms of rate of change, when we think about the allowance that we have today, frankly, we could imagine prices not improving from where they are today. And so the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss reflects a lot of things, and that's not just price. It reflects the [indiscernible] which we just described for Matt, the distribution of upstream midstream services in each of them behaved differently. We've got customers that are oil or gas heavy depending on what their business model looks a little bit different basin by basin around the country and by method of extraction as well. So there's a lot more to what losses are going to look like in '16 than just the spot price or the expected near forward price of crude. Having said that, we've sensitized, such that we are sitting here at the $30 area a year from now and believe that our allowance accurately or appropriately reflects the lost content that we may have."

One notable difference in '16 versus '15, I'm not sure if anybody else is focused on this in their calls, but we also have this new incremental FDIC insurance surcharge every bank over $10 billion in assets.

My understanding is that the smaller banks, regional banks have only recently begun to really pullback from the willingness to provide credit and maybe it's this incremental leg down to where we are in crude prices that has people generally believing that this could be where we are for a longer time. I wouldn't say that there's a tremendous demand for incremental credit right now. It's more about how quickly you're asking or require your customers to come into conformance under their borrowing base. What you're doing with their excess cash, what they're doing with that CapEx program. And I'd say we're all being as appropriately tough to make sure that we protect the interest of the bank. We are very -- we're ready with these customers to help them work through this doesn't do us any good to accelerate an issue or 2 to end up as the holder of a number of oil leases as a bank. And so there's -- that dictates some of the cadence.

They're either in business or they're not in business. And if they're not in business, you got to figure out how to maximize the recovery as quickly as possible, because some of their inventory, which is security for the loan, maybe very single purpose, and that's a little bit of a different workout.

And this one's different in a couple of respects. First of all, the economy in the U.S. is more diversified. So the communities, in which energy plays a role, is more diversified. Not true in every community but -- and we look at that. Secondly, companies this time around ranked much more quickly. I think in past corrections, there was more open fire going on for higher prices or a rebound, and so they reacted quickly. And I'd also say this time around, the way companies financed themselves, there was -- there is more private equity and other debt that would be supportive to the bank. So there's been -- there are differences. And I'd say the final thing is the mismatch between supply and demand at the world level is fairly narrow, so there's about 93 million barrels produced a day and about 92 million consumed. So it's a very narrow mismatch and demand seems to still be increasing. So I'm not suggesting that's going to make this problem go away anytime soon. The Saudis are pumping like crazy, so are the Russians. And of course, what's happened with type of oil here in the U.S. But so there are differences.

I can tell you also that the LIBOR resets seemed to have occurred the way we would have expected them after the Fed moved in December, so the asset side is behaving as we expected.

So we will probably talk about this in some depth at our Investor Day then there's a couple important things. One of them is the mix of the assets of our balance sheet today compared to where it used to be. So home equity sort of a going away business because we've had a portfolio that's been shrinking for a long-time it's been improving and performance and is just is not being added for a variety of reasons on a net basis, and that's unlikely to change. That was a big source of absolute dollars or loss in the weighted average charge-off rate through the -- leading up to the crisis. When you think about the residential real estate but full you hear, what we're adding is all high-grade prime jumbo loans origination. It's our very safe loans. I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that coming through that portfolio. It feels very good. And while I'm sure, it'll change a little bit overtime, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did precrisis, because it was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might ho;d. So I think that's important. Also in the percentage of our portfolio and card business, we're trying to grow the credit card business, we like it a lot. It's obviously got the much more volatile charge-off profile. But at $30 billion, $40 billion or even $50 billion worth of assets at Wells Fargo, it's going to have -- if you're comparing us against other banks, for example, that can have an impact. I think those are a couple of -- that contribution to mix is something that you need to have a sense for. And I think what you'll hear from us when we revisit this at Investor Day is that our current expectation for normalized through the cycle loss rate will be lower than the last time that we talked about it. Probably higher than 33 basis points, but lower than 75 or whatever we signaled to you 2 years ago."

Our strong performance in 2015 reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our focus on the real economy. Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion in -- of auto loans, almost $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers, who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of Commercial Real Estate loans. We are active in facilitating the payments that drive economic activity across the country with over $280 billion of debit card purchase volume, $70 billion of consumer credit card purchase volume and $25 billion of commercial cards spend volume in 2015. We also contributed to the communities we serve in many other ways that are not directly reflected in our financial results, but are just as important to our success. For example, we've had the nation's #1 United Way campaign for 6 consecutive years.
Let me highlight a few of our other accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.15. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit results continued to be very strong with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year. However, since we did not have any reserve release in the second half of the year, our provision expense increased $1 billion compared with a year ago. Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders, our fifth consecutive year of increased returns. We returned $12.6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to the economic environment. While parts of the global economy have continued to experience stress and the markets have reacted negatively in the early weeks of 2016, domestic economic conditions remain generally favorable. As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S.-centric company and the strength and diversity of the U.S. economy benefited our results in 2015. The economy continues to advance, with strong job creation, including 70 consecutive months of gains in private payrolls, the longest run ever recorded. While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power cost, which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes. 
Auto vehicle sales were the best ever in 2015 and Wells Fargo originated a record number of auto loans during the year. If gas prices continue to remain low, 2016 should be another strong year for the auto market. The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6%, helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago. While December housing data is not yet available, 2015 appears to be the best year for home sales and housing starts since 2007. Inventories of homes for sale remained historically low, providing a tailwind for building activity into 2016. 
Commercial real estate appreciation has been even stronger than consumer real estate and vacancy rates, where nearly all property types continue to decline. For apartments, vacancy rates are at historic lows, which should benefit both construction activity and pricing in 2016. 
Finally, the building blocks of our long-term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success. I'm excited about our opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customers' financial needs. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results. John?"

While our fourth quarter e",2982,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and a gain from the sale of our government-guaranteed student loan portfolio. Our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with a year ago, we continue to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit, we had positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans, and we continue to have strong liquidity and capital levels. 
Now let me highlight these key drivers in more detail. On Page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share. These results are even more impressive when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2015, while we continue to invest in our business. For example, loan-loss reserve releases declined from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $450 million in 2015. The sustained low rate environment and our disciplined redeployment of our strong deposit growth reduced our margin by 12 basis points. We continue to invest in risk management-related activities and these expenses were up 12% compared with 2014. We strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity and capital levels.
Turning to Page 4. We grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short-term investments and investment securities all increasing. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt increased $14.3 billion with $17.8 billion of issuances, including debt related to funding the previously announced GE Capital acquisitions. The debt we issued in the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about 8 years at a cost of approximately 3 months LIBOR plus 70 basis points. However, $10.5 billion of these issuances have a shorter maturity and become eligible for prepayment during the first half of '16. By beginning to prefund the GE Capital acquisitions, we were able to maintain our strong liquidity position and our healthy level of dry powder to fund prospective balance sheet growth, while retaining the flexibility to prepay a significant portion of the debt should we determine it is no longer needed.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined to $289 million from third quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income, primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now achieved year-over-year loan growth for 18 consecutive quarters. Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.3 billion and consumer loans grew $6.1 billion from third quarter. We did not acquire any loan portfolios in the fourth quarter so the linked-quarter growth was all organic. The GE Capital transactions that we announced last quarter will start to be reflected in our first quarter results. The GE Railcar Services transaction, with $4.1 billion of loans and leases closed on January 1, making us the largest railcar operating lessor in North America. We anticipate the North American base portion about 90% of the approximately $31 billion of assets we expect to acquire from GE Capital to close late in the first quarter, with the remainder expected to close in the second quarter. We're looking forward to having many talented and experienced people from these businesses join our team. Page 20 in the appendix has additional updates on these transactions.
On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $28.1 billion or 10% from a year ago. The growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit growth in Commercial Real Estate, Asset Backed Finance, Corporate Banking, Equipment Finance, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth and high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.2 billion or 8% from last year. We continue to benefit from the strong auto market, while we remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $3.3 billion or 9% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points, down 1 basis point from a year ago and stable with third quarter. We stated that we believe deposit betas will be lower at least initially during this rate cycle and lower than they had been in past periods of rising rates. Indications since the rate move in December support this, however, we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers, while maintaining our disciplined relationship-based pricing strategy. This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth with primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8%. Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Page 9 highlights Wells Fargo's revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Over the past year, as we've benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4%, while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago. As a result, net interest income generated just over half of our revenue in the fourth quarter.
We grew net interest income $408 million from a year ago even as the net interest margin declined 12 basis points. The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held for sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the third quarter. Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by a customer-driven deposit growth, which reduced the margin by 3 basis points that had a minimal impact on net interest income. All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances, including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call. 
We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income, which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth even in the challenging rate environment during 2015. On a full year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015 in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth. If there are additional rate increases during 2016, we would expect our net interest income growth for 2016 to be higher than the 4% growth rate we achieved in 2015.
Total noninterest income declined $420 million from third quarter, primarily driven by lower equity gains. Gains from equity investments were $423 million in the fourth quarter, which were in line with the quarterly average over the past 2 years. Equity gains declined 6% in full year 2015 compared with 2014, and considering the current market conditions in our pipeline, we would expect continued declines in 2016. The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results and capital markets-related businesses, including Investment Banking and trading, and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses, including retail brokerage, asset management and trust. 
We had linked-quarter growth in a number of our businesses, including Investment Banking, card fees, Commercial Real Estate brokerage and Mortgage Banking. Mortgage Banking revenue increased $71 million from third quarter. Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago, benefiting from a stronger housing market. We ended the quarter with a $29 billion application pipeline, down 15% from third quarter, but up 12% from a year ago. Our production margin on residential, held-for-sale mortgage originations was 183 basis points in the fourth quarter, down from 188 basis points in the third quarter. Mortgage origination revenue in the fourth quarter benefited from $128 million repurchased reserve release as we resolved certain exposures and revised liability assumptions. Higher mortgage origination revenue also reflected stronger multifamily mortgage activity in the fourth quarter.
Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period and interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of warranty solutions last quarter, which benefited third quarter income. There are also a few linked-quarter changes in some fee categories that were not driven by business activity. Merchant processing fees as reported declined $182 million linked quarter. These fees are now reported in other income as a result of an accounting change, which was P&L neutral. The increasing gains from trading activities this quarter was due to higher deferred compensation gains, which are offset in employee benefits, and they are also P&L neutral.
As shown on Page 12, expenses were stable with the third quarter and we remained focused on expense management. There are a few items to highlight that impacted the linked-quarter trend in some specific categories. The increase in employee benefits expense reflected $319 million of higher deferred comp expense, which was primarily offset in trading revenue. Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from the lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Also, third quarter expenses included a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $181 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals outside professional services increased $164 million, which included higher project-related spending. Advertising expenses were also elevated, up $49 million. While these typically higher fourth quarter expenses should be lower next quarter, as usual, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. 
Our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the full year 2015, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter. We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them exceptional customer service. In fact, we were ranked #1 in customer satisfaction in the national bank category according to the 2015 American Customer Satisfaction Index. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Debit card purchase volume was $73 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago; and credit card purchase volume was $18.9 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Our credit card penetration in Retail Banking households increased to 43.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 41.5% a year ago. We received the highest-ranking and Corporate Insight assessment of credit card issuer rewards redemption options. And just this week, we launched a new Propel American Express card with no annual fee. Our customers are also increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 7% and active mobile customers up 14% from a year ago. To better support our customers as they grow their companies, we've moved business banking and merchant payment services, which were previously included within Community Banking, to Wholesale Banking. For comparative purposes, prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this realignment.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from year ago and up 9% from third quarter. The linked-quarter growth reflected higher net interest and noninterest income. The increase in fee income was driven by Investment Banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volcker as well as Commercial Real Estate-related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage and advisory business, multifamily capital and structured real estate. Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposits grew 6% from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our deposit pricing for our wholesale customers and we were focused on relationship-based pricing for both deposits and loans.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $595 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from a year ago and down 2% from third quarter. Growth from a year ago is driven by positive operating leverage with expenses down 2% and revenue up 1%. Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 15% from a year ago. Average deposits grew 7% from a year ago and average loans grew 15%, the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings, including high-quality, nonconforming mortgage loans, commercial loans and securities-based lending. Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations, which were partially offset by positive flows.
Turning to Page 16. Credit quality remained strong, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Our net charge-off rate was 36 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter, and seasonally higher consumer losses. The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios, which are 36% of our loans outstanding, continue to benefit from the improving housing market. 
Nonperforming assets have declined for 13 consecutive quarters and were down $497 million from third quarter, driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and the $342 million reduction in foreclosed assets. Oil and gas loan accruals were $843 million, up $277 million from third quarter. However, as of year-end, over 90% of our nonaccrual oil and gas loans were current on interest payments. We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio. Total loans in our oil and gas portfolio were down 6% from a year ago and are now less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions, and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014. However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge, and at current price levels, we would expect another higher oil and gas losses in 2016. We've considered the challenges within the energy sector and our allowance process throughout 2015 and approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. It's important to note that the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. We've also considered the impact of lower energy prices on our debt and equity securities portfolio and had approximately $130 million of OTTI-related write-downs in our energy-related holdings in the quarter.
Turning to Page 17. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio, fully phased-in at 10.7% in the fourth quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers in our internal -- and buffers -- regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us well for the acquisitions we announced in 2015 and for returning more capital to shareholders. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, and our net payout ratio was 59%.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings. We continued to invest in our businesses, grew capital and liquidity and maintained a strong risk culture. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and expect our customer base to grow both organically and through acquisitions, including from the customers and platforms we are acquiring from GE Capital in 2016. We remain focused on satisfying our new and existing customers' financial needs.

All of the other ones are performing. In terms of rate of change, when we think about the allowance that we have today, frankly, we could imagine prices not improving from where they are today. And so the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss reflects a lot of things, and it's not just price. It reflects the -- what we just described for Matt, the distribution of upstream/midstream services and each of them behaved differently. We've got customers that are oil or gas heavy depending on what their business model looks a little bit different basin by basin around the country and by method of extraction as well. So there's a lot more to what losses are going to look like in '16 than just the spot price or the expected near forward price of crude. Having said that, we've sensitized it, such that we're sitting here at the $30 area a year from now and believe that our allowance accurately or appropriately reflects the lost content that we may have."

We're still in an elevated time of product development and sort of offensive-related spend. And so I think that, that's part of what guides us to this higher end for the time being. One notable difference in '16 versus '15, I'm not sure if anybody else is focused on this in their calls, but we also have this new incremental FDIC insurance surcharge every bank over $10 billion in assets. And that's worth $480 million pretax to Wells Fargo for its partial year impact in 2016, so we're all going to have something like that for the next year or 2 while that works its way through. So I would think about that, and that begins, I think, in Q2 of '16, and then if it's enacted in its current form, which it's anticipated to be. So if we have 2 or 3 moves in 2016 by the Fed and if they happen ratably throughout the course of the year, that incremental revenue will have a beneficial impact on efficiency ratio, but I don't know that it drives us below the middle of the range. So I think the range is still appropriate. We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets or -- that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile. But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year.

So it's a way for us to really enrich the relationship, get closer to the manufacturer and, in some cases, expand the program that we may already have been a smaller player in and, in other -- in many other cases, to create a program or to step into a program that's working well.

And unreimbursed servicing costs, I'd say, are -- as we look out, they start to improve quarter by quarter over the course of the next several -- so that's one benefit that we'll see. But in terms of the market overall, we're still -- we're very, very big in conforming with Fannie and Freddie, and there's more to do there. We think of it as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, some of the early indicators for purchase activity look really good. More jobs, more available housing to buy and more people moving into prime first-time homebuyer and second-time home buyer age cohorts. Those are all very supportive, so..."

We're actually, as you know, sort of quite open for energy companies. Very early in this in that, that has gone away. My understanding is that smaller banks, regional banks, have only recently begun to really pull back from a willingness to provide credit. And maybe it's this incremental lag down to where we are in crude prices that has people generally believing that this could be where we are for a longer time. I wouldn't say that there's a tremendous demand for incremental credit right now. It's more about how quickly you're asking or requiring your customers to come into conformance under their borrowing base. What you're doing with their excess cash, what they're doing with their CapEx program and -- I'd say we're all being as appropriately tough to make sure that we protect the interest of the bank. We're very -- I mean, we're working with each customer to help them work through this. It doesn't do us any good to accelerate an issue or 2 to end up as the holder of a number of oil leases as a bank. And so there's a -- that dictates some of the cadence. Services companies, I think, are different than E&P companies because, for some of them, it's really not about $5 bend of oil prices or a $10 bend of oil prices. They're either in business, or they're not in business. And if they're not in business, you got to figure out how to maximize the recovery as quickly as possible because some of their inventory, which is security for the loan, may be very single purpose. And I'd say that's a little bit of a different workout. I don't know if that's helpful, but that's how we're seeing it.."

So I've -- and then we saw, of course, the one in -- there's been a couple of cycles since that time. And this one's different in a couple of respects. First of all, the economy in the U.S. is more diversified. So the communities in which energy plays a role is more diversified. Not true in every community, but -- and we look at that. Secondly, companies this time around reacted much more quickly. I think in past corrections, there was more hope and prayer going on for higher prices or a rebound. And so they reacted quickly. And I'd also say, this time around, the way companies financed themselves, there was -- there is more private equity and other debt that would be subordinate to the bank debt. So there has been -- there are differences. And I'd say the final thing is this is the mismatch between supply and demand at the world level is fairly narrow. So there's about 93 million barrels produced a day and about 92 million consumed. So it's a very narrow mismatch, and demand seems to still be increasing. So I'm not suggesting that's going to make this problem go away anytime soon. The Saudis are pumping like crazy, so are the Russians. And of course, with what's happened with tight oil here in the U.S., but -- so there are differences. And our people who run this portfolio for us have seen many or most of those cycles.

I can tell you also that LIBOR resets seemed to have occurred the way we would have expected them after the Fed moved in December. So the asset side is behaving as we expected. It's -- a 25 basis point move is not a giant needle mover in terms of dollars and cents for Wells Fargo.

So we'll probably talk about this in some depth at our Investor Day. And there's a couple important things. One of them is the mix of the assets of our balance sheet today compared to where it used to be. So home equity is sort of a going-away business because we've got a portfolio that's been shrinking for a long time, it's been improving in performance, and it just is not being added for a variety of reasons on a net basis. And that's unlikely to change. That was a big source of our absolute dollars or loss in a weighted average charge-off rate through the -- leading up to and through the crisis. When you think about the residential real estate portfolio here, what we're adding is all high-grade -- it's prime jumbo origination. It's our -- they're very safe loans. I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that, coming through that portfolio. It feels very good. And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre crisis because it was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold. So I think that's important also in the percentage of our portfolio in the card business, we're trying to grow the credit card business, we like it a lot. It's obviously got a much more volatile charge-off profile to it. But at $30 billion, $40 billion or even $50 billion worth of assets at Wells Fargo, it's going to have -- if you're comparing us against other banks, for example, that's going to have an impact. I think those are a couple of -- that contribution to mix is something that you need to have a sense for. And I think what you'll hear from us when we revisit this at Investor Day is that our current expectation for our normalized through-the-cycle loss rate will be lower than the last time that we talked about it.

Our strong performance in 2015 reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our focus on the real economy. Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion in -- of auto loans, almost $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers, who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of Commercial Real Estate loans. We are active in facilitating the payments that drive economic activity across the country with over $280 billion of debit card purchase volume, $70 billion of consumer credit card purchase volume and $25 billion of commercial card spend volume in 2015. We also contributed to the communities we serve in many other ways that are not directly reflected in our financial results, but are just as important to our success. For example, we've had the nation's #1 United Way campaign for 6 consecutive years.
Let me highlight a few of our other accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.15. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit results continue to be very strong with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year. However, since we did not have any reserve release in the second half of the year, our provision expense increased $1 billion compared with a year ago. Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders, our fifth consecutive year of increased returns. We returned $12.6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to the economic environment. While parts of the global economy have continued to experience stress and the markets have reacted negatively in the early weeks of 2016, domestic economic conditions remain generally favorable. As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S.-centric company and the strength and diversity of the U.S. economy benefited our results in 2015. The economy continues to advance, with strong job creation, including 70 consecutive months of gains in private payrolls, the longest run ever recorded. While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power costs, which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes. 
Auto vehicle sales were the best ever in 2015 and Wells Fargo originated a record number of auto loans during the year. If gas prices continue to remain low, 2016 should be another strong year for the auto market. The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6%, helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago. While December housing data is not yet available, 2015 appears to be the best year for home sales and housing starts since 2007. Inventories of homes for sale remained historically low, providing a tailwind for building activity into 2016. 
Commercial real estate appreciation has been even stronger than consumer real estate, and vacancy rates for nearly all property types continue to decline. For apartments, vacancy rates are at historic lows, which should benefit both construction activity and pricing in 2016. 
Finally, the building blocks of our long-term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success. I'm excited about our opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customers' financial needs. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results. John?"

While our fourth quarter e",2979,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and a gain from the sale of our government-guaranteed student loan portfolio. Our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with a year ago, we continued to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit, we had positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans, and we continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels. 
Now let me highlight these key drivers in more detail. On Page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share. These results are even more impressive when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2015, while we continued to invest in our business. For example, loan-loss reserve releases declined from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $450 million in 2015. The sustained low rate environment and our disciplined redeployment of our strong deposit growth reduced our margin by 12 basis points. We continued to invest in risk management-related activities and these expenses were up 12% compared with 2014. We strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity and capital levels.
Turning to Page 4. We grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short-term investments and investment securities all increasing. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt increased $14.3 billion with $17.8 billion of issuances, including debt related to funding the previously announced GE Capital acquisitions. The debt we issued in the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about 8 years at a cost of approximately 3 month LIBOR plus 70 basis points. However, $10.5 billion of these issuances have a shorter maturity and become eligible for prepayment during the first half of '16. By beginning to prefund the GE Capital acquisitions, we were able to maintain our strong liquidity position and our healthy level of dry powder to fund prospective balance sheet growth, while retaining the flexibility to prepay a significant portion of the debt should we determine it is no longer needed.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined $289 million from third quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income, primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now achieved year-over-year loan growth for 18 consecutive quarters. Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.3 billion and consumer loans grew $6.1 billion from third quarter. We did not acquire any loan portfolios in the fourth quarter so the linked-quarter growth was all organic. The GE Capital transactions that we announced last quarter will start to be reflected in our first quarter results. The GE Railcar Services transaction, with $4.1 billion of loans and leases closed on January 1, making us the largest railcar operating lessor in North America. We anticipate the North American based portion about 90% of the approximately $31 billion of assets we expect to acquire from GE Capital to close late in the first quarter, with the remainder expected to close in the second quarter. We're looking forward to having many talented and experienced people from these businesses join our team. Page 20 in the appendix has additional updates on these transactions.
On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $28.1 billion or 10% from a year ago. The growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit growth in Commercial Real Estate, Asset Backed Finance, Corporate Banking, Equipment Finance, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.2 billion or 8% from last year. We continued to benefit from the strong auto market, while we remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $3.3 billion or 9% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points, down 1 basis point from a year ago and stable with third quarter. We've stated that we believe deposit betas will be lower at least initially during this rate cycle and lower than they had been in past periods of rising rates. Indications since the rate move in December support this, however, we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers, while maintaining our disciplined relationship-based pricing strategy. This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth with primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8%. Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Page 9 highlights Wells Fargo's revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Over the past year, as we've benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4%, while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago. As a result, net interest income generated just over half of our revenue in the fourth quarter.
We grew net interest income $408 million from a year ago even as the net interest margin declined 12 basis points. The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held for sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the third quarter. Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by customer-driven deposit growth, which reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had a minimal impact on net interest income. All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances, including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call. 
We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income, which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth even in the challenging rate environment during 2015. On a full year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015 in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth. If there are additional rate increases during 2016, we would expect our net interest income growth for 2016 to be higher than the 4% growth rate we achieved in 2015.
Total noninterest income declined $420 million from third quarter, primarily driven by lower equity gains. Gains from equity investments were $423 million in the fourth quarter, which were in line with the quarterly average over the past 2 years. Equity gains declined 6% in full year 2015 compared with 2014, and considering the current market conditions and our pipeline, we would expect continued declines in 2016. The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results in capital markets-related businesses, including Investment Banking and trading, and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses, including retail brokerage, asset management and trust. 
We had linked-quarter growth in a number of our businesses, including Investment Banking, card fees, Commercial Real Estate brokerage and Mortgage Banking. Mortgage Banking revenue increased $71 million from third quarter. Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago, benefiting from a stronger housing market. We ended the quarter with a $29 billion application pipeline, down 15% from third quarter, but up 12% from a year ago. Our production margin on residential, held-for-sale mortgage originations was 183 basis points in the fourth quarter, down from 188 basis points in the third quarter. Mortgage origination revenue in the fourth quarter benefited from $128 million repurchased reserve release as we resolved certain exposures and revised liability assumptions. Higher mortgage origination revenue also reflected stronger multifamily mortgage activity in the fourth quarter.
Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period-end interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of warranty solutions last quarter, which benefited third quarter income. There are also a few linked-quarter changes in some fee categories that were not driven by business activity. Merchant processing fees as reported declined $182 million linked quarter. These fees are now reported in other income as a result of an accounting change, which was P&L neutral. The increasing gains from trading activities this quarter was due to higher deferred compensation gains, which are offset in employee benefits, and are also P&L neutral.
As shown on Page 12, expenses were stable with the third quarter and we remained focused on expense management. There are a few items to highlight that impacted the linked-quarter trend in some specific categories. The increase in employee benefits expense reflected $319 million of higher deferred comp expense, which was primarily offset in trading revenue. Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Also, third quarter expenses included a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $181 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals. Outside professional services increased $164 million, which included higher project-related spending. Advertising expenses were also elevated, up $49 million. While these typically higher fourth quarter expenses should be lower next quarter, as usual, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. 
Our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the full year 2015, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter. We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them exceptional customer service. In fact, we were ranked #1 in customer satisfaction in the national bank category according to the 2015 American Customer Satisfaction Index. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Debit card purchase volume was $73 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago; and credit card purchase volume was $18.9 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Our credit card penetration of Retail Banking households increased to 43.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 41.5% a year ago. We received the highest-ranking in Corporate Insight assessment of credit card issuer rewards redemption options. And just this week, we launched a new Propel American Express card with no annual fee. Our customers are also increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 7% and active mobile customers up 14% from a year ago. To better support our customers as they grow their companies, we've moved business banking and merchant payment services, which were previously included within Community Banking, to Wholesale Banking. For comparative purposes, prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this realignment.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from a year ago and up 9% from third quarter. The linked-quarter growth reflected higher net interest and noninterest income. The increase in fee income was driven by Investment Banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volcker as well as Commercial Real Estate-related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our Commercial Real Estate brokerage and advisory business, multifamily capital and structured real estate. Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposits grew 6% from a year ago. We remained disciplined in our deposit pricing for our wholesale customers and we were focused on relationship-based pricing for both deposits and loans.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $595 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from a year ago and down 2% from third quarter. Growth from a year ago was driven by positive operating leverage with expenses down 2% and revenue up 1%. Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 15% from a year ago. Average deposits grew 7% from a year ago and average loans grew 15%, the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings, including high-quality, nonconforming mortgage loans, commercial loans and securities-based lending. Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations, which were partially offset by positive flows.
Turning to Page 16. Credit quality remained strong, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Our net charge-off rate was 36 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter, and seasonally higher consumer losses. The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios, which are 36% of our loans outstanding, continued to benefit from the improving housing market. 
Nonperforming assets have declined for 13 consecutive quarters and were down $497 million from third quarter, driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and a $342 million reduction in foreclosed assets. Oil and gas loan accruals were $843 million, up $277 million from third quarter. However, as of year-end, over 90% of our nonaccrual oil and gas loans were current on interest payments. We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio. Total loans in our oil and gas portfolio were down 6% from a year ago and are now less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions, and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014. However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge, and at current price levels, we would expect to have higher oil and gas losses in 2016. We've considered the challenges within the energy sector and our allowance process throughout 2015 and approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. It's important to note that the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. We've also considered the impact of lower energy prices on our debt and equity securities portfolio and had approximately $130 million of OTTI-related write-downs in our energy-related holdings in the quarter.
Turning to Page 17. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio, fully phased-in at 10.7% in the fourth quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers in our internal -- and buffers -- regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us well for the acquisitions we announced in 2015 and for returning more capital to shareholders. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, and our net payout ratio was 59%.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings. We continued to invest in our businesses, grew capital and liquidity and maintained a strong risk culture. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and expect our customer base to grow both organically and through acquisitions, including from the customers and platforms we are acquiring from GE Capital in 2016. We remain focused on satisfying our new and existing customers' financial needs.

And so the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss reflects a lot of things, and it's not just price. It reflects the -- what we just described for Matt, the distribution of upstream/midstream services and each of them behaved differently. We've got customers that are oil or gas heavy depending on what their business model -- it looks a little bit different basin by basin around the country and by method of extraction as well. So there's a lot more to what losses are going to look like in '16 than just the spot price or the expected near forward price of crude.

We're still in an elevated time of product development and sort of offensive-related spend. And so I think that that's part of what guides us to this higher end for the time being. One notable difference in '16 versus '15, I'm not sure if anybody else has focused on this in their calls, but we also have this new incremental FDIC insurance surcharge, every bank over $10 billion in assets. And that's worth $480 million pretax to Wells Fargo for its partial year impact in 2016, so we're all going to have something like that for the next year or 2 while that works its way through. So I would think about that, and that begins, I think, in Q2 of '16, and then if it's enacted in its current form, which it's anticipated to be. So if we have 2 or 3 moves in 2016 by the Fed and if they happen ratably throughout the course of the year, that incremental revenue will have a beneficial impact on efficiency ratio, but I don't know that it drives us below the middle of the range. So I think the range is still appropriate. We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets or -- that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile. But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year.

So it's a way for us to really enrich the relationship, get closer to the manufacturer and, in some cases, expand a program that we may already have been a smaller player in and, in other -- in many other cases, to create a program or to step into a program that's working well.

In terms of servicing, retrenching, it's -- we'll get to a more normalized level of defaulted loan workout activity over the course of the next couple of years as that -- the full crisis era inventory works its way off. And then we'll find out what the stabilized run rate is for productivity, for how many people it takes to service a portfolio of our size that's behaving more normally. And so there is incremental benefit to take out, but we're not in a hurry to do it. It's more important that the loans are serviced properly and the customers are dealt with in the way that they require. But -- so there's some upside there. And unreimbursed servicing costs, I'd say, are -- as we look out, they start to improve quarter by quarter over the course of the next several, so that's one benefit that we'll see. But in terms of the market overall, we're still -- we're very, very big in conforming with Fannie and Freddie, and there's more to do there. We think of it as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, some of the early indicators for purchase activity look really good. More jobs, more available housing to buy and more people moving into prime first-time homebuyer and second-time home buyer age cohorts. Those are all very supportive, so..."

So in terms of pullback in credit availability. I would expand the description to say not just bank credit but capital markets were actually, as you know, sort of quite open for energy companies very early in this and that, that has gone away. My understanding is that smaller banks, regional banks, have only recently begun to really pull back from a willingness to provide credit. And maybe it's this incremental leg down to where we are in crude prices that has people generally believing that this could be where we are for a longer time. I wouldn't say that there's a tremendous demand for incremental credit right now. It's more about how quickly you're asking or requiring your customers to come into conformance under their borrowing base. What you're doing with their excess cash, what they're doing with their CapEx program and -- I'd say we're all being appropriately tough to make sure that we protect the interests of the bank. We're very -- I mean, we're working with each customer to help them work through this. It doesn't do us any good to accelerate an issue or to end up as the holder of a number of oil leases as a bank. And so there's a -- that dictates some of the cadence. Services companies, I think, are different than E&P companies because, for some of them, it's really not about a $5 band of oil prices or a $10 band of oil prices. They're either in business, or they're not in business. And if they're not in business, you got to figure out how to maximize the recovery as quickly as possible because some of their inventory, which is security for the loan, may be very single purpose. And I'd say that's a little bit of a different workout. I don't know if that's helpful, but that's how we're seeing it.."

So I've -- and then we saw, of course, the one in -- there's been a couple of cycles since that time. And this one's different in a couple of respects. First of all, the economy in the U.S. is more diversified. So the communities in which energy plays a role is more diversified. Not true in every community, but -- and we look at that. Secondly, companies this time around reacted much more quickly. I think in past corrections, there was more hope and prayer going on for higher prices or a rebound. And so they reacted quickly. And I'd also say, this time around, the way companies financed themselves, there was -- there is more private equity and other debt that would be subordinate to the bank debt. So there has been -- there are differences. And I'd say the final thing is this is the mismatch between supply and demand at the world level is fairly narrow. So there's about 93 million barrels produced a day and about 92 million consumed. So it's a very narrow mismatch, and demand seems to still be increasing. So I'm not suggesting that's going to make this problem go away anytime soon. The Saudis are pumping like crazy, so are the Russians. And of course, with what's happened with tight oil here in the U.S., but -- so there are differences. And our people who run this portfolio for us have seen many or most of those cycles.

When you think about the residential real estate portfolio here, what we're adding is all high-grade -- it's prime jumbo origination. It's our -- they're very safe loans. I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that, coming through that portfolio. It feels very good. And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre-crisis because it was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold. So I think that's important. Also, the percentage of our portfolio in the card business, we're trying to grow the credit card business, we like it a lot. It's obviously got a much more volatile charge-off profile to it. But at $30 billion, $40 billion or even $50 billion worth of assets at Wells Fargo, it's going to have -- if you're comparing us against other banks, for example, that's going to have an impact. I think those are a couple of -- that contribution to mix is something that you need to have a sense for. And I think what you'll hear from us when we revisit this at Investor Day is that our current expectation for our normalized through-the-cycle loss rate will be lower than the last time that we talked about it. Probably higher than 33 basis points, but lower than 75 or whatever we signaled to you 2 years ago."

Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near-term headwinds, our long-term results continue to be driven by our focus on the real economy. 
For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S., and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high. We continue to grow our customer base, both organically and through acquisitions, and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in 5 years. 
We work to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one. And our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized, with Wells Fargo ranking #1 in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys. 
Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. 
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. And we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%. While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continue to have strong credit results, with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter.
As you know, yesterday, the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by 8 banks including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission.
Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. 
For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the cost for consumers and most businesses. Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. 
Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowing. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than 1 percentage point lower than the long-term average and several percentage points lower than what the prerecession level was in late 2007. 
The housing market continues to do well with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial Real Estate also remains strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors, and our CRE portfolio continue to generate net recoveries.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long-term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?"

John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, 1 of only 2 companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline. While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million reserve release.
Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business, resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other noninterest income. All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges, reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect to hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship but the impact in every quarter will vary. 
We had $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, of our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call. 
Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter. 
On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.
Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined to $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. 
Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion, with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion, reflecting growth in deposits, long-term debt and our disciplined approach to managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call. 
As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. 
Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending, which more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.
We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE Capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high-quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track, and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. 
We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest-earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in noninterest income as leased income. 
On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases, which included $24 billion of loans and interest-earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions.
Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. This slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some Wholesale Banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle, and they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.
Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and 1 less day in the quarter. 
The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.
Total noninterest income increased $530 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the increase in all other noninterest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. Noninterest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. 
The linked-quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our markets businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees, which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains, down $281 million from the fourth quarter. 
While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago, driven by account growth. Mortgage Banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. 
Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of corresponding originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.
As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases, which became effective late in the first quarter and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising costs, which are also expected to increase. 
We had $454 million of operating losses, primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter. Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate the surcharge, along with the previously approved base rate reduction, will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2016. 
Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year of 2016.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers, which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth, along with increased usage in new product offerings, benefited our debit and credit card businesses. 
Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award-winning digital offerings, with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users, with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. Investment Banking declined on overall market weakness, and some of our Commercial Real Estate-related businesses had weaker results coming off of very strong fourth quarter performance.
Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits for market volatility and the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year results reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 14%, offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked-quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs. 
Balance sheet growth remained strong, with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth, with continued growth in nonconforming mortgage loans and securities-based lending. We have successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisers pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisers that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had with recruiting these financial advisers and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management.
Turning to Page 18. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio. 
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Nonperforming assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter. We had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas nonaccruals and $343 million of nonaccrual loans from the GE Capital acquisitions, which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate nonaccruals and lower foreclosed assets. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the  quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015, we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion.
Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines, primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable, with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies. 
Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings are to investment-grade companies based on public ratings. However, there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only 11 of our borrowers have filed during that time. Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of net new loans. 
Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter, with declines across all 3 sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities and parts from determinations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment-grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio. 
Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we worked through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by a reduced production runoff of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers' financial condition. As a result of these factors, we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter. 
Nonaccrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate. Approximately 90% of the nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal, which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our nonaccrual loans are senior secured. 
Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, increased to 57% of the portfolio, reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrowers' financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding, but as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio.
Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through this cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in 8 states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production. 
We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions. And having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years, consumer delinquent -- delinquencies in oil-dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non-oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration, and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we've tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil-dependent regions. 
We're also actively monitoring Commercial Real Estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements. 
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business, and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team, and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. 
We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We're proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. 
We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter, reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity. But we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continue to benefit our fundamental drivers of long-term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position. 
We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our Investor Day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions."

And to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate, in particular, it's certainly possible that, that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side. That's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again, we'll only know at the end of the quarter. With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year, we're -- we've -- we're constantly reassessing borrower quality. We're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans. We are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% of bank completed so we'll have the rest of that information. That's name by name, capital structure by capital structure so that'll continue to inform things. We've definitely taken steps, or for example, categorized loans as nonperforming even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We're in the $40 context today. We were in the $30s for a while. Some of these capital structures need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year because we feel great about the reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter or this was a quarter that things will unfold as depending on what happens with prices both spot and forward and the pace of restructuring of services and E&P companies."

But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said, we're categorizing loans as nonperforming. We're recognizing loss, these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken. That's our own credit folks determining that there's something to be done. It's not as the result of final resolution or workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan. And we can do that even before we've completed a redetermination. So from an impact to Wells Fargo point of view, we're always trying to stay in front of it."

And we don't set out to be #1 just to be #1. We work really hard and if we do really, we provide great products and services and great value, we grow because of that. There's a couple areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in Wealth and Investment Management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here even though we have a powerful, wonderful group of leaders and advisers across the geography. We could still do a lot more business. A lot of our customer bank who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense, terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific. On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, our debit activity but not our credit card activity even though we've grown that significantly internally. But over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that would be opportunistic. We've been doing great organically. be some opportunities along the line that would make sense, we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt-on, that would help us in those areas specifically but other areas generally, sure, we'd look at that. But that's our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long-term shareholder value here, value creation is doing more of what we're doing, just doing it better."

So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the consumer portfolios, all of them, we're going MSA by MSA in comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. The greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use. We've also included Houston, for example, to your point, about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we discovered is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time, no surprise, because that's where the growth has been coming from and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases, measures of LTV based on what's changing in asset values, they look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it's, at least at this point, that it's another [indiscernible] drop in the short term. But as you expect, less employment people, loans will perform differently. In Commercial Real Estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep drive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20%, including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that, first and foremost, frankly with respect to what it means to our risk, to our loan portfolio and feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things of that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures, then that probably is the first, second order outcome that people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in the 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country, but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either."

So -- and we are very, very careful buyers. And I see us as a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said, organically. If something, and what we've done in the last 4, 5 years have been largely bolt-on, I would say GE was a bigger -- a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all, this is your money.

We've -- I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile. And we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars, in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were #1, I think we're #2 right now, and we're bidding on buying the loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk reward, and we're passing on those that we don't. Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now. I mean, seasonally, obviously, we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way. Collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter, but we're still, from a risk-adjusted basis, well within the in which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had an eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim index in particular, is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether a loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or the recent past. And that index has been down, I think, 3% linked-quarter, 2% year-over-year. So all things being equal, we'd expect to be a little bit worse when weak sessions occur. But having said that, we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market-leading position to just slip a little bit other people by the most that don't make sense for us. We still a great business for us. It has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers before up and We have a Commercial Banking business with the dealership community, and we're in this for the long haul. One more thing, I guess, I -- we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge, I think, in this environment. That may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations."

Our results frankly, we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. We -- as you say, we've been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There'll be plenty of more need for that as the industry repairs itself. And being in a position to provide that is actually good for us. We've got industry-leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them.

Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we're picking up and That begins when the assets are in place. But importantly, one of the reasons that we're describing that says as modestly accretive in the year is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future or different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's loan file work to do, thre's some paperwork to do. There's a lot of things of that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in the regulated environment that we're operating in, and we'll pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that.

Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rat",667,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near-term headwinds, our long-term results continue to be driven by our focus on the real economy. 
For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S., and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high. We continue to grow our customer base, both organically and through acquisitions, and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in 5 years. 
We work to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one. And our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized, with Wells Fargo ranking #1 in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys. 
Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. 
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%. While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continue to have strong credit results, with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter.
As you know, yesterday, the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by 8 banks including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission.
Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. 
For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the cost for consumers and most businesses. Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. 
Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowing. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long-term average and several percentage points lower than what the prerecession level was in late 2007. 
The housing market continues to do well, with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial Real Estate also remains strong, with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors, and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long-term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?"

John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only 2 companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline. While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million reserve release.
Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business, resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other noninterest income. All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges, reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship, but the impact in every quarter will vary. 
We had $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call.
Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we've completed during the quarter.
On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.
Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. 
Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion, with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion, reflecting growth in deposits, long-term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call. 
As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. 
Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending, which more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.
We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE Capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high-quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track, and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. 
We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest-earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in noninterest income as leased income. 
On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases, which included $24 billion of loans and interest-earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions.
Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market, while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. This slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some Wholesale Banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.
Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter. 
The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015, even if there are no additional rate increases.
Total noninterest income increased $530 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the increase in all other noninterest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. Noninterest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we'd completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. 
The linked-quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our market's businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees, which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains, down $281 million from the fourth quarter. 
While linked-quarter trends and deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago, driven by account growth. Mortgage Banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. 
Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of corresponding originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.
As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases, which became effective late in the first quarter and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising costs, which are also expected to increase. 
We had $454 million of operating losses, primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter. Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the surcharge, along with the previously approved base rate reduction, will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter, starting in the third quarter of 2016. 
Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers, which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth, along with increased usage in new product offerings, benefited our debit and credit card businesses. 
Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award-winning digital offerings, with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users, with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. Investment Banking declined on overall market weakness, and some of our Commercial Real Estate-related businesses had weaker results coming off of very strong fourth quarter performance.
Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits for market volatility and the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year results reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 14%, offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked-quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs.
Balance sheet growth remained strong, with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth, with continued growth in nonconforming mortgage loans and securities-based lending. We have successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisers pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisers that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had with recruiting these financial advisers and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management.
Turning to Page 18. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio. 
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Nonperforming assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter. We had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas nonaccruals and $343 million of nonaccrual loans from the GE Capital acquisitions, which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate nonaccruals and lower foreclosed assets. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the  quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015, we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios, while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion.
Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines, primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable, with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies. 
Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings are to investment-grade companies based on public ratings. However, there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only 11 of our borrowers have filed during that time. Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of net new loans. 
Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter, with declines across all 3 sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities and part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment-grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio. 
Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we worked through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by a reduced production runoff of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers' financial condition. As a result of these factors, we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter. 
Nonaccrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate. Approximately 90% of the nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal, which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our nonaccrual loans are senior secured. 
Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, increased to 57% of the portfolio, reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrowers' financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding, but as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio.
Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through this cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in 8 states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production. 
We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions. And having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years, consumer delinquent -- delinquencies in oil-dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non-oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration, and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we've tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil-dependent regions. 
We're also actively monitoring Commercial Real Estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements. 
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business, and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team, and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. 
We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We're proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. 
We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter, reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity, but we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continue to benefit our fundamental drivers of long-term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits, while maintaining our strong capital position. 
We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model, while highlighting the quality of our team at our Investor Day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions."

We're analyzing the reserve every quarter. And to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate, in particular, it's certainly possible that, that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side. That's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again, we'll only know at the end of the quarter. With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year, we're -- we've -- we're constantly reassessing borrower quality. We're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed. So we'll have the rest of that information. That's name by name, capital structure by capital structure. So that'll continue to inform things. We've definitely taken steps, or for example, categorized loans as nonperforming even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We're in the $40 context today. We were in the $30s for a while. Some of these capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year because we feel great about our reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter or this was the  quarter that things will unfold as they're going to unfold, depending on what happens with prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies."

When we went into the downturn, we had over $100 billion of Pick-a-Pay loans and over $100 billion of home equity loans, and those were the 2 toughest residential portfolios. Today, those portfolios are less than half of what we started with. And the performance is really, really good. So there's a lot of momentum on that side that has been -- that's happened over the last 3 years, but especially in last year or 2."

But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said, we're categorizing loans as nonperforming. We're recognizing loss, these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken. That's our own credit folks determining that there's something to be done. It's not as the result of final resolution or workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan.

And we don't set out to be #1, just to be #1. We work really hard and if we do, really, we provide great products and services and great value, we grow because of that. There's a couple of areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in Wealth and Investment Management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here even though we have a powerful, wonderful group of leaders and advisers across the geography. We could still do a lot more business. There's a lot of -- our customers who call us -- our bank, who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense, terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific. On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, our debit activity, but not our credit card activity even though we've grown that significantly internally. But over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that would be opportunistic. We've been doing a great job organically. If there'd be some opportunities along the line that would make sense, we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt-on, that would help us in those areas specifically, but other areas generally, sure, we'd look at that. But that's -- our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long-term shareholder values here, value creation, is doing more of what we're doing, just doing it better."

So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the consumer portfolios, all of them, we're going MSA by MSA in comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. The greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use. But we've also included Houston, for example, to your point, about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we've discovered is, is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time. No surprise, because that's where all the growth has been coming from, and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases, measures of LTV, based on what's changing in asset values. They look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it's a -- at least at this point, that it's another queue to drop in the short term. But as you expect, less employment, people will -- loans will perform differently. In Commercial Real Estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20%, including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that, first and foremost, frankly with respect to what it means to our risk, to our loan portfolio and feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures, then that probably is the first, second order outcome than what people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country, but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years. Not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it, but not enough to feel like we're stalling either."

the farthest reach, the deepest relationships, the long enduring customer thing, so, so-- and we are very, very careful buyers. And I see us as a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said, organically. If something, and what we've done in the last 4 or 5 years have been largely bolt-on, I would say GE was a bigger -- a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all, this is your money.

Given what we've seen in the industry and some deterioration in the subprime portfolios, could you help us gain an understanding of what your expectations are through the rest of this year and into 2017 given the state of the auto industry, and how hot it's been over the last couple of years?"

We've -- I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile. And we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars, in particular, that has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were #1, I think we're #2 right now, and we're bidding on buying loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk reward, and we're passing on those that we don't. Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now. I mean, seasonally, obviously, we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because that -- those loans behave that way. Collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter, but we're still, from a risk-adjusted basis, well within the band to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had an eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index, in particular, is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether a loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past. And that index has been down, I think, 3% linked-quarter, 2% year-over-year. So all things being equal, we'd expect severity to be a little bit worse when reap sessions occur. But having said that, we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market-leading position to slip a little bit, while other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us. It's still a great business for us. It has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers, given a big floor plan business. We have a big Commercial Banking business with the dealership community, and we're in this for the long haul. One more thing, I guess, I -- we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge, I think, in this environment. That may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations."

But from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point if view, we like the trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers. But we're not thinking much differently about it. Our results frankly were, we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. We -- as you say, we've been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There'll be plenty more need for that as the industry repairs itself. And being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us. We've got industry-leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them. But like others, it's a cyclical business, and while it's -- while there's less capital raising going on there right now, there is more going on in other spaces and a lot of advisory work to do.

So just -- let me just check off a few I was just thinking while John was talking: we're no longer in the wholesale mortgage business, we're not in the joint venture business, we're not in the reverse mortgage business, we're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays. So we're not as deep in that business as we had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The direct deposit advance business is no longer here. We're not in the government student lending business, not a lot are. We used it in Wells Fargo Financial business that it's very different today. So yes, we've grown in deposits. We've grown in our corporate loans, et al., and wealth management. All those are kind of things that we're involved in, but a much simpler company today in many respects."

Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the leased assets that we're picking up and they come over that and that begins when the assets are in place. But importantly, one of the reasons that we're describing this as, as modestly accretive in the year is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future or different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, there's some paperwork to do. There's a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in the regulated environment that we're operating in, and we'll pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rat",667,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near-term headwinds, our long-term results continue to be driven by our focus on the real economy. 
For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S., and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high. We continue to grow our customer base, both organically and through acquisitions, and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in 5 years. 
We work to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one. And our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized, with Wells Fargo ranking #1 in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys. 
Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. 
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%. While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results, with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter.
As you know, yesterday, the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by 8 banks including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission.
Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. 
For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the cost for consumers and most businesses. Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. 
Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowing. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long-term average and several percentage points lower than what the prerecession level was in late 2007. 
The housing market continues to do well, with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial Real Estate also remains strong, with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors, and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long-term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities. 
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?"

John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only 2 companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline. While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million reserve release.
Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business, resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other noninterest income. All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges, reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship, but the impact in every quarter will vary. 
We had $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call.
Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter.
On Page 4, we show that strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. 
Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. 
Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion, with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion, reflecting growth in deposits, long-term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call. 
As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. 
Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending, which more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.
We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE Capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high-quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track, and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. 
We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest-earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in noninterest income as leased income. 
On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases, which included $24 billion of loans and interest-earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions.
Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core 1-4 Family First Mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market, while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. 
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. This slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some Wholesale Banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.
Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter. 
The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015, even if there are no additional rate increases.
Total noninterest income increased $530 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the increase in all other noninterest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. Noninterest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we'd completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. 
The linked-quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our market's businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees, which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains, down $281 million from the fourth quarter. 
While linked-quarter trends and deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago, driven by account growth. Mortgage Banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. 
Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of corresponding originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.
As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases, which became effective late in the first quarter and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising costs, which are also expected to increase. 
We had $454 million of operating losses, primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter. Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the surcharge, along with the previously approved base rate reduction, will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter, starting in the third quarter of 2016. 
Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers, which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth, along with increased usage in new product offerings, benefited our debit and credit card businesses. 
Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award-winning digital offerings, with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users, with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. Investment Banking declined on overall market weakness, and some of our Commercial Real Estate-related businesses had weaker results coming off of very strong fourth quarter performance.
Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year results reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 14%, offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked-quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs.
Balance sheet growth remained strong, with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth, with continued growth in nonconforming mortgage loans and securities-based lending. We have successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisers pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisers that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had with recruiting these financial advisers and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management.
Turning to Page 18. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio. 
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Nonperforming assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter. We had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas nonaccruals and $343 million of nonaccrual loans from the GE Capital acquisitions, which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate nonaccruals and lower foreclosed assets. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the  quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015, we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios, while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion.
Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines, primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable, with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies. 
Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings are to investment-grade companies based on public ratings. However, there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only 11 of our borrowers have filed during that time. Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of net new loans. 
Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter, with declines across all 3 sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities and part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment-grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio. 
Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we worked through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by a reduced production runoff of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers' financial condition. As a result of these factors, we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter. 
Nonaccrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate. Approximately 90% of the nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal, which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our nonaccrual loans are senior secured. 
Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, increased to 57% of the portfolio, reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrowers' financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding, but as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio.
Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through this cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in 8 states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production. 
We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions. And having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years, consumer delinquent -- delinquencies in oil-dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non-oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration, and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we've tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil-dependent regions. 
We're also actively monitoring Commercial Real Estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements. 
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business, and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team, and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. 
We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We're proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. 
We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter, reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity, but we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continue to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continue to benefit our fundamental drivers of long-term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits, while maintaining our strong capital position. 
We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model, while highlighting the quality of our team at our Investor Day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions."

We're analyzing the reserve every quarter. And to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate, in particular, it's certainly possible that, that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side. That's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again, we'll only know at the end of the quarter. With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year, we're -- we've -- we're constantly reassessing borrower quality. We're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed. So we'll have the rest of that information. That's name by name, capital structure by capital structure. So that'll continue to inform things. We've definitely taken steps, or for example, categorized loans as nonperforming even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We're in the $40 context today. We were in the $30s for a while. Some of these capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year because we feel great about our reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter or this was the quarter that things will unfold as they're going to unfold, depending on what happens with prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies."

But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said, we're categorizing loans as nonperforming. We're recognizing loss, these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken. That's our own credit folks determining that there's something to be done. It's not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan.

And we don't set out to be #1, just to be #1. We work really hard and if we do, really, we provide great products and services and great value, we grow because of that. There's a couple of areas where we are sub-optimized, that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in Wealth and Investment Management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here even though we have a powerful, wonderful group of leaders and advisers across the geography. We could still do a lot more business. There's a lot of our customers who call us our bank, who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense, terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific. On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, our debit activity, but not our credit card activity, even though we've grown that significantly internally. But over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that would be opportunistic. We've been doing a great job organically. If there'd be some opportunities along the line that would make sense, we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt-on, that would help us in those areas specifically, but other areas generally, sure, we'd look at that. But that's -- our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long-term shareholder values here, value creation, is doing more of what we're doing, just doing it better."

So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the consumer portfolios, all of them, we're going MSA by MSA in comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. The greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use. But we've also included Houston, for example, to your point about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we've discovered is, is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time. No surprise, because that's where all the growth has been coming from, and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases, measures of LTV, based on what's changing in asset values. They look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it's a -- at least at this point, that it's another queue to drop in the short term. But as you expect, less employment, people will -- loans will perform differently. In Commercial Real Estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20%, including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that, first and foremost, frankly, with respect to what it means to our risks, to our loan portfolio and feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures, then that probably is the first, second order outcome that people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country, but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years. Not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it, but not enough to feel like we're stalling either."

And we now have a company that is the best company I've ever worked for, the strongest brand, the best people, the furthest reach, the deepest relationships, the long enduring customer thing. So, so-- and we are very, very careful buyers. And I see us as a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said, organically. If something -- and what we've done in the last 4 or 5 years have been largely bolt-on, I would say GE was a bigger -- a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all, this is your money.

It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter, but we're still, from a risk-adjusted basis, well within the band to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index, in particular, is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether a loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past. And that index has been down, I think, 3% linked-quarter, 2% year-over-year. So all things being equal, we'd expect severity to be a little bit worse when reap sessions occur. But having said that, we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market-leading position to slip a little bit, while other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us. It's still a great business for us. It has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers, we have a big floor plan business. We have a big Commercial Banking business with the dealership community, and we're in this for the long haul. One more thing, I guess I'd -- we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge, I think, in this environment. That may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations."

The pattern's been the same since the merger of Wells and Wachovia to make sure that we've got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of Wells Fargo who need it. We think our risks are well sized. We think our capabilities are well sized. There's always, as you point out, there are things to add here and there. But from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point of view, we like the trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers. But we're not thinking much differently about it. Our results, frankly were, we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. We -- as you say, we've been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There'll be plenty more need for that as the industry repairs itself. And being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us. We've got industry-leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them. But like others, it's a cyclical business, and while it's -- while there's less capital raising going on there right now, there's more going on in other spaces and a lot of advisory work to do. So it fits together very nicely with our Wholesale Bank."

With respect to the feedback that we got in the living will, there are some actionable things that we're going to get right on. But there's nothing about size, about complexity, about the nature of our business model, about our capital, about our liquidity.

So just -- let me just check off a few I was just thinking while John was talking: we're no longer in the wholesale mortgage business, we're not in the joint venture business, we're not in the reverse mortgage business, we're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays. So we're not as deep in that business as we had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The direct deposit advance business is no longer here. We're not in the government student lending business, not a lot are. We used to have a Wells Fargo Financial business that it's very different today. So yes, we've grown in deposits. We've grown in our corporate loans, et al., and wealth management. All those are kind of things that we're involved in, but a much simpler company today in many respects."

Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we're picking up and they come over. That begins when the assets are in place. But importantly, one of the reasons that we're describing this as modestly accretive in the year, is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future or different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, there's some paperwork to do. There's a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in the regulated environment that we're operating in, and we'll pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings",697,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. 
We produced strong performance during a period that has had -- has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment and deposit balances are all at record levels, and we've maintained our strong risk discipline.
Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage while we continue to make investments throughout our businesses. 
Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the primary -- the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge-offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. 
We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholders' equity, which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time, and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. 
Incidentally when the former Norwest, which where I came from, and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at that time were slightly less than $200 billion. Now our stockholders' equity exceeds that, remarkable results over that period of time.
Turning to the economic environment. Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected, putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because as you know, we are largely a U.S.-centric company, and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the U.S. economy. 
After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers, where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big-ticket items was especially robust and sentiment surveys show that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise, with the second quarter on pace to have the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. 
Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally, and appreciation isn't just restricted to coastal states. Every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remain solid, with 69 [ph] consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record, including the strong June report released just last week.
Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announcement we made earlier this week. Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years, has decided to retire at year-end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise, one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. 
Mary Mack, who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors, will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences, including Retail Banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reins at this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable, long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource. 
I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John?"
292891,331647342,1007101,"Wells Fargo & Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Wells Fargo & Company","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2.

My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. Then John and I will answer your questions.
Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth. We increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remains solid and our capital position remains strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter.
On Page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million for the year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release, while this quarter, we had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
Turning to Page 4. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower for longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion of purchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate declined late in the quarter driven by the Brexit vote. 
We also added to duration, as we've done in the past, with interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our variable-rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions, we remain asset-sensitive.
Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances, including a 10.7 -- including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC-eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant, including a 100 basis point buffer, which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately 5 years. However, this year, we have a high level of debt maturing so some of our eligible TLAC issuance this year will be used to offset these maturities.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call, but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. 
As I mentioned at Investor Day, for several years now, we've been focused on reducing noncore businesses, simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business, and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for a $290 million gain. The go-forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results.
Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that we completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day, the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired, along with corresponding higher operating lease expense.
The acquisition of the Asia segment to GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business was completed on July 1, and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We're pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses, and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period-end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter. Remember, the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. 
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked-quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields.
On Page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14%, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8% primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3%, with strong growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued runoff of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. 
Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7% with origination volume up 2% while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10%, reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6%, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago, and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. While the drivers of noninterest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter.
Market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities, can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market-sensitive results in the second quarter, which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains, was partially offset by lower equity gains. To sum, we're only $85 million higher than the 5-quarter average.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by loan growth, including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income in our investment securities portfolio, reflecting accelerated prepayments primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets. 
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM.
We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago, even with an 11 basis point reduction in NIM. And we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment.
While total noninterest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on our key business drivers, including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity and lease income, reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition. 
Total Mortgage Banking revenue, which includes both the gain on sale from originations and servicing income, declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41%, reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. 
Applications were up 23% from first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we've seen refinance activity increase, with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks. And we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in third quarter compared with the second quarter. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. 
Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments, which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. These MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated. Overall, we're pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter, given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs primarily related to FHA loans.
Other income declined $392 million from first quarter. The reduction was driven by a decline in hedge ineffectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefit services business in the second quarter, with the net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared to the first quarter.
As shown on Page 12, expenses declined $162 million from first quarter driven by lower personnel expenses, which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million, reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. 
Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter. Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from the first quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter, reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge, which became effective July 1.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
While we're already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. While total expenses have increased, we've reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses has primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending, reflected in higher personnel expense, outside professional services and contract services. 
We've also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me give you just a few examples. During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan and Online Fast Decision Loan that's funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. 
In addition, we launched yourFirstMortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low to moderate income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive, with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. 
In Wholesale Banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting iPrint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This slide highlights just a few examples that we've recently announced. We're working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 14. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date Retail Banking household retention in 4 years. 
We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs. Because the key to our success is long-lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome e-mail, including a summary of accounts and ways to get the full value from their accounts. 
We're also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payments. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo as our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our share pay service in 2015.
We are the #1 debit card issuer by transaction volume, which increased 9% from a year ago, while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago, benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration of Retail Banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However, charge-offs for Wholesale Banking are still historically low, with only 27 basis points of net charge-offs annualized in the second quarter. 
Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked-quarter as net interest income and noninterest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Our continued emphasis on meeting our clients' financial needs through plan-based relationship resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago, with growth resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisition. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. 
Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem, who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth.
Turning to Page 17. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $38 million from the first quarter, including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio, which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses. 
Nonperforming assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and Commercial Real Estate nonaccruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas nonaccruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build during the quarter, primarily related to loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio. While oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago, there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge-offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter, with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sectors. 
Nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the runoff of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Most of the losses we've taken were from nonaccruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full. 
Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we're also seeing opportunities, and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. 
Criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter, reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge-offs. And for the first time in the past 6 quarters, we did not have a reserve build for our oil and gas portfolio, and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the increase in energy prices, the slower pace of deterioration in credit quality, improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio. Overall, the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us as our -- and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
Turning to Page 19. Our capital levels remain strong, with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. 
We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of $44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio is 62%, within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model. We had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We've continued to benefit from executing on our vision with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower for longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions, but we'll continue to focus on what we can control, earning life-long relationships with their customers, which drive our long-term growth opportunities. John and I will now answer your questions."

If this flatter yield curve persists and we don't have -- we don't see rate hikes from the Fed, I'm wondering what you think are your stronger -- strongest levers for supporting EPS growth from here. Is it continued balance sheet growth? Is it even more disciplined expense management? Is it growth in fees and businesses where you don't have scale yet?

If rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth. And the first call in our capital and liquidity is to serve customers so we'll be looking for loan growth. And we've had great success in organic loan growth in commercial categories as well as in consumer category so that would be job 1. I think we're seeing nice momentum across a variety of the fee streams that we have. I mentioned some of them in my remarks. But there are many and some of them are businesses where we already have complete scale, and some of them are businesses that -- where we're under-indexed and continuing to grow so may be the long-term opportunity is even bigger. I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we're trying to accomplish and compliance and risk management but innovate at the same time and stay within our range, which we've managed to do. And we're -- as I also called out, we're sort of -- we're comping over periods where we had been releasing excess allowance and now because our loan portfolio is growing, we're building some allowance. So we're muscling through that headwind. But we're accomplishing our goals."

Once you get into a rhythm, there's an opportunity to get more eloquent, start to take some of those front-end costs out and build it and start your process. John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard. And frankly, a lot of the investments we're making on customer service and customer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back-end benefit. So those things are all on the table. We continue to look at those. And in a lower for longer environment, pennies and nickels and dimes matter."

We're balancing the capital sensitivity if what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates. We're saying we think it's going to be lower for longer but we have desensitized ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy, what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So there's a delicate balance going on all the time. But I would say that we're relatively convinced that we may not be this low for forever but we're, like we said a year ago, our expectation is lower for longer out the curve. And we're going to keep putting money to work."

And it really hasn't seemed to come to pass. I don't know whether aggregate credit creation is outstripping aggregate deposit generation by so much that it's going to cause firms at the margin to raise prices, compete for deposits and drive up the cost for the rest of us. It could happen, we haven't seen it. What we're seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands.

The time of the merger, we had something less than $800 billion of deposits. Now we're over $1.2 trillion. We've grown deposits even after runoff of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion, $500 billion. We're up maybe $100 billion on loans for net a period of time so deposits have far outstripped loans in fact. If you believe lower for longer, there's going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while a quarter or 2 might look different recently, if we look at -- in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans, if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look at it on an organic basis, we're still growing deposits faster.

As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in part, it was from consumer credit but that's based on the growth in the portfolio, not because of any meaningful change in underlying behavior. My sense is that if those loans are priced properly for their risk and given the way that we provide for them as those portfolios grow, that it shouldn't become too much of a headwind. Now we said earlier that we're happy to provide more reserve, more allowance when we're growing our loan portfolio. That's because it was going to happen as we came out of a period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning growth.

You saw what we did last year when we -- or earlier this year as we were sizing up, taking the GE assets under the book -- our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside. And now we're allowing that to run off. It was relatively short term.

That's happened, that's in our run rate. A lot of the digital and mobile migration that we have of customer activity is taking personal interactions out of those types of transactions, taking paper out for sure. And those benefits feed right into the run rate as they happen. John was mentioning the initial investment in build to create some of these new programs and compliance and risk management, for example, and the fact that once they're highly effective and repeatable, that there's an opportunity to automate, to streamline, to learn from how we got there and to make them more efficient. I'd say those opportunities are -- we're always learning, but they're probably will bit more in the future. And then who knows where we'll be going with the increase in mobility, et cetera. My sense is we're just going to keep benefiting. Customers benefit on the one hand but from an expense perspective, we'll keep benefiting as well.

So I would say that our underwriting approach to Commercial Real Estate tends to be at the conservative end of the spectrum and where we have a reputation often far better, sometimes to the chagrin of customers for approaching it that way, which helps us well through cycles. This is, as you're alluding to, this is a very cyclical business. It is regional and local. It is property type by property type. There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital and that creates one sort of outcome. And then there are others where there's just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on, has to be observed that creates a different dynamic. We're seeing that, we have seen that in some multifamily or luxury single-family from market to market. And that -- in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We're taking the same approach that we always have, which relatively low loan-to-value lender where you look very hard at in-place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections in our bigger Commercial Real Estate types of financing. And that's -- it's always been true. So I'm sure when the cycle churns, there'll be either property types or geographies where they do better or worse. But we're not taking a big change. We're not seeing a big sea change. Our originations actually have been slower. Certainly, we're slower before we bought the seasoned GE portfolio, the organic activity because of the competitive environment and because of the market circumstances caused us to slow down there somewhat."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has had -- has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment and deposit balances are all at record levels, and we've maintained our strong risk discipline.
Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, and our pretax pre,provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage while we continue to make investments throughout our businesses. 
Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the primary -- the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge-offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. 
We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholders' equity, which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time, and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which -- where I came from, and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion. Now our stockholders' equity exceeds that, remarkable results over that period of time.
Turning to the economic environment. Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected, putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because, as you know, we are largely a U.S.-centric company, and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the U.S. economy. 
After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers, where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big-ticket items was especially robust, and sentiment surveys show that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise, with the second quarter on pace to have the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. 
Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally, and appreciation isn't just restricted to coastal states. Every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remained solid, with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record, including the strong June report released just last week.
Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announcement we made earlier this week. Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking, who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years, has decided to retire at year-end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise, one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. 
Mary Mack, who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors, will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences, including Retail Banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reins of this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable, long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource. 
I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John?"

My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. Then John and I will answer your questions.
Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth. We increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remained solid, and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter.
On Page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from the year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release while this quarter, we had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
Turning to Page 4. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower for longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion of purchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate declined late in the quarter, driven by the Brexit vote. 
We also added to duration, as we've done in the past, with interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our variable-rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions, we remain asset-sensitive.
Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances, including a 10.7 -- including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC-eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant, including a 100 basis point buffer, which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately 5 years. However, this year, we have a high level of debt maturing so some of our eligible TLAC issuance this year will be used to offset these maturities.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call, but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. 
As I mentioned at Investor Day, for several years now, we've been focused on reducing noncore businesses, simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business, and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for a $290 million gain. The go-forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results.
Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that we completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day, the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired, along with corresponding higher operating lease expense. 
The acquisition of the Asia segment of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business was completed on July 1, and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We're pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses, and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period-end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter. Remember, the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. 
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields.
On Page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14%, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8%, primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3%, with strong growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued runoff of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7%, with origination volume up 2%, while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10%, reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6%, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago, and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. While the drivers of noninterest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter. 
Market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities, can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market-sensitive results in the second quarter, which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains, was partially offset by lower equity gains. To sum, we're only $85 million higher than the 5-quarter average.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by loan growth, including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income in our investment securities portfolio, reflecting accelerated prepayments, primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets. 
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago, even with an 11 basis point reduction in NIM, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment.
While total noninterest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on our key business drivers, including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity and lease income, reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition. 
Total Mortgage Banking revenue, which includes both the gain on sale from originations and servicing income, declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41%, reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. 
Applications were up 23% from first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we've seen refinance activity increase, with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks. And we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in third quarter compared with the second quarter. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. 
Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments, which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. These MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated. Overall, we're pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter, given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs primarily related to FHA loans.
Other income declined $392 million from first quarter. The reduction was driven by a decline in hedge ineffectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefit services business in the second quarter, with the net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared to the first quarter.
As shown on Page 12, expenses declined $162 million from first quarter, driven by lower personnel expenses, which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million, reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter. 
Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from first quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter, reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge, which became effective July 1.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.  While we're already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. 
While total expenses have increased, we've reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses has primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending, reflected in higher personnel expense, outside professional services and contract services. We've also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me give you just a few examples. 
During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an online fast-decision loan that's funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In addition, we launched yourFirst Mortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive, with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. 
In Wholesale Banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting iPrint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This slide highlights just a few examples that we've recently announced. We're working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 14. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date Retail Banking household retention in 4 years. 
We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs because the key to our success is long-lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome e-mail, including a summary of accounts and ways to get the full value from their accounts. 
We're also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel, and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payments. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo as our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our share pay service in 2015.
We are the #1 debit card issuer by transaction volume, which increased 9% from a year ago, while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago, benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration of Retail Banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However, charge-offs for Wholesale Banking are still historically low, with only 27 basis points of net charge-offs annualized in the second quarter. 
Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and noninterest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Our continued emphasis on meeting our clients' financial needs through client-based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago, with growth resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisition. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago, and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. 
We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem, who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth.
Turning to Page 17. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $38 million from the first quarter, including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio, which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses. 
Nonperforming assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and Commercial Real Estate nonaccruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas nonaccruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build during the quarter, primarily related to loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio. While oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago, there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge-offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter, with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sectors. 
Nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the runoff of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Most of the losses we've taken were from nonaccruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full. 
Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we're also seeing opportunities, and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. 
Criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter, reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge-offs. And for the first time in the past 6 quarters, we did not have a reserve build for our oil and gas portfolio, and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the increase in energy prices, the slower pace of deterioration in credit quality, improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio. Overall, the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us as -- and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
Turning to Page 19. Our capital levels remained strong, with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of $44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio is 62%, within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model. We had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We've continued to benefit from executing on our vision, with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions, but we'll continue to focus on what we can control, earning life-long relationships with our customers, which drive our long-term growth opportunities.

Once you get into a rhythm, there's an opportunity to get more eloquent, start to take some of those front-end costs out and build it as part of your process. John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard. And frankly, a lot of the investments we're making on customer service and customer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back-end benefit. So those things are all on the table. We continue to look at those. And in a lower-for-longer environment, pennies and nickels and dimes matter."

And the things that we're balancing are -- and readjusting constantly are our expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point than waiting a quarter or waiting longer. We're balancing the capital sensitivity, what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates. We're saying we think it's going to be lower for longer, but we have desensitized ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy, what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So there's a delicate balance going on all the time. But I would say that we're relatively convinced that we may not be this low for forever. But we're -- like we said a year ago, our expectation is lower for longer out the curve, and we're going to keep putting money to work."

It could happen. We haven't seen it. What we're seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands.

We've grown deposits even after runoff of a -- of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion, $500 billion. We're up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits have far outstripped loans in fact. If you believe lower for longer, there's going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while a quarter or 2 might look different recently, if we look at -- in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans, if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look at it on an organic basis, we're still growing deposits faster.

Even as we originate at this pace, there's more servicing getting called away from us as others do -- as others originate rapidly as well. So I would expect that to normalize, and I would think about that also as something more along the lines of a multi-quarter average. And one other item I'd point out is that the unreimbursed servicing cost was a net drag -- an incremental net drag this quarter as well. That's mostly around FHA activity."

There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital, and that creates one sort of outcome. And then there are others where there is just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on and has to be absorbed. Now that creates a different dynamic. We're seeing that. We have seen that in some multifamily or luxury single-family from market to market. And that -- in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We're taking the same approach that we always have. We're sort of a relatively low loan-to-value lender. We look very hard at in-place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections in our bigger Commercial Real Estate types of financings. And that's -- it's always been true.

We would agree -- if I didn't mention that, it was an oversight. There is a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms.

And this is how that's shaking out. You pointed out that there's been some more wholesale funding on the liability side. We went out and put on some shortish term. I think it shows up as long term because it's beyond a year, but shortish-term financing to make sure we had funding in place for the GE assets as they came on. Some of that will roll off; some of that we might hang on to for a while, but it's a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation path. And we will be over the course of the next several years. And that will add to that portion of liability stack."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has had -- has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment and deposit balances are all at record levels, and we've maintained our strong risk discipline.
Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage while we continued to make investments throughout our businesses. 
Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the primary -- the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge-offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. 
We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholders' equity, which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time, and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which -- where I came from, and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion. Now our stockholders' equity exceeds that, remarkable results over that period of time.
Turning to the economic environment. Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected, putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because, as you know, we are largely a U.S.-centric company, and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the U.S. economy. 
After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers, where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big-ticket items was especially robust, and sentiment surveys show that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise, with the second quarter on pace to have the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. 
Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally, and appreciation isn't just restricted to coastal states. Every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remained solid, with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record, including the strong June report released just last week.
Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announcement we made earlier this week. Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking, who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years, has decided to retire at year-end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise, one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. 
Mary Mack, who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors, will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences, including Retail Banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reins of this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable, long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource. 
I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John?"

My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. Then John and I will answer your questions.
Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth. We increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remained solid, and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter.
On Page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release, while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
Turning to Page 4. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower for longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter, significantly higher than the $5 billion of purchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate decline late in the quarter, driven by the Brexit vote. 
We also added to duration, as we've done in the past, with interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our variable-rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions, we remain asset-sensitive.
Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances, including a 10.7 -- including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC-eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant, including a 100 basis point buffer, which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately 5 years. However, this year, we have a high level of debt maturing so some of our eligible TLAC issuance this year will be used to offset these maturities.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call, but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. 
As I mentioned at Investor Day, for several years now, we've been focused on reducing noncore businesses, simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business, and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for a $290 million gain. The go-forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results.
Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that we completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day, the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired, along with corresponding higher operating lease expense. 
The acquisition of the Asia segment of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business was completed on July 1, and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We're pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses, and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period-end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter. Remember, the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. 
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields.
On Page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14%, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8%, primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3%, with strong growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued runoff of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7%, with origination volume up 2%, while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10%, reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6%, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago, and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. While the drivers of noninterest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter. 
Market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities, can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market-sensitive results in the second quarter, which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains, was partially offset by lower equity gains. The sum, we're only $85 million higher than the 5-quarter average.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by loan growth, including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income in our investment securities portfolio, reflecting accelerated prepayments, primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets. 
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago, even with an 11 basis point reduction in NIM, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment.
While total noninterest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on our key business drivers, including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity and lease income, reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition. 
Total Mortgage Banking revenue, which includes both the gain on sale from originations and servicing income, declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41%, reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. 
Applications were up 23% from first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we've seen refinance activity increase, with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks. And we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in third quarter compared with the second quarter. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. 
Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments, which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. These MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated. Overall, we're pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter, given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs primarily related to FHA loans.
Other income declined $392 million from first quarter. The reduction was driven by a decline in hedge ineffectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefit services business in the second quarter, with the net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared to the first quarter.
As shown on Page 12, expenses declined $162 million from first quarter, driven by lower personnel expenses, which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million, reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter. 
Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from first quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter, reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge, which became effective July 1.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.  While we're already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. 
While total expenses have increased, we've reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses has primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending, reflected in higher personnel expense, outside professional services and contract services. We've also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me give you just a few examples. 
During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an online fast-decision loan that's funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In addition, we launched yourFirst Mortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive, with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. 
In Wholesale Banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting iPrint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This slide highlights just a few examples that we've recently announced. We're working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 14. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date Retail Banking household retention in 4 years. 
We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs, because the key to our success is long-lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome e-mail, including a summary of accounts and ways to get the full value from their accounts. 
We're also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel, and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payments. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo as our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015.
We are the #1 debit card issuer by transaction volume, which increased 9% from a year ago, while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago, benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration of Retail Banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However, charge-offs for Wholesale Banking are still historically low, with only 27 basis points of net charge-offs annualized in the second quarter. 
Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and noninterest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Our continued emphasis on meeting our clients' financial needs through plan-based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago, with growth resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisition. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago, and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. 
We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem, who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth.
Turning to Page 17. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $38 million from the first quarter, including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio, which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses. 
Nonperforming assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and Commercial Real Estate nonaccruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas nonaccruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build during the quarter, primarily related to loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio. While oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago, there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge-offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter, with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sectors. 
Nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the runoff of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Most of the losses we've taken were from nonaccruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full. 
Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we're also seeing opportunities, and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. 
Criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter, reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge-offs. And for the first time in the past 6 quarters, we did not have a reserve build for our oil and gas portfolio, and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the increase in energy prices, the slower pace of deterioration in credit quality, improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio. Overall, the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us as -- and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
Turning to Page 19. Our capital levels remained strong, with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of $44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio is 62%, within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model. We had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We've continued to benefit from executing on our vision, with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions, but we'll continue to focus on what we can control, earning life-long relationships with our customers, which drive our long-term growth opportunities. 
John and I will now answer your questions."

If this flatter yield curve persists and we don't have -- we don't see rate hikes from the Fed, I'm wondering what you think are your stronger -- strongest levers for supporting EPS growth from here. Is it continued balance sheet growth? Is it even more disciplined expense management? Is it growth in fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet?

And we've -- some of them were -- are businesses where we already have complete scale, and some of them are businesses that we're -- where we're under-indexed and continuing to grow. So maybe the long-term opportunity is even bigger. I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we're trying to accomplish in compliance and risk management, but innovate at the same time and stay within our range, which we've managed to do. And we're -- as I also called out, we're sort of -- we're comping over periods where we had been releasing excess allowance and now, because our loan portfolio is growing, we're building some allowance.

We're balancing the capital sensitivity of what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates. We're saying we think it's going to be lower for longer, but we have to sensitize ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy, what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So there's a delicate balance going on all the time. But I would say that we're relatively convinced that we may not be this low for forever. But we're -- like we said a year ago, our expectation is lower for longer out the curve, and we're going to keep putting money to work."

It could happen. We haven't seen it. What we're seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands.

So we've grown deposits even after a runoff of a -- of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion, $500 billion. We're up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits have far outstripped loans in fact. If you believe lower for longer, there's going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while a quarter or 2 might look different, recently, if we look at -- in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans, if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look at it on an organic basis, we're still growing deposits faster.

Now we've said earlier that we're happy to provide more reserve, more allowance when we're growing our loan portfolio.

And we've continued to dimension the ability to move out of cash or HQLA and into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity. You saw what we did last year when we -- or earlier this year as we were sizing up taking the GE assets onto their book -- our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside. And now we're allowing that to run off. It was relatively short term. But it makes sense for us to have ready access to something -- some -- call it $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time. That's given our size, given our risk profile and given our stress cases. Is that helpful?"

This is -- as you're alluding to, this is a very cyclical business. It is regional and local. It is property type by property type. There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital, and that creates one sort of outcome. And then there are others where there is just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on and has to be absorbed. That creates a different dynamic. We're seeing that. We have seen that in some multifamily or luxury single-family from market to market. And that -- in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We're taking the same approach that we always have. We're sort of a relatively low loan-to-value lender. We look very hard at in-place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections in our bigger Commercial Real Estate types of financings. And that's -- it's always been true. So I'm sure when the cycle turns, there'll be either property types or geographies where -- that do better or worse. But we're not taking a big change. We're not seeing a big sea change.

We have a reasonably large allocation to single-family whole loan real estate -- residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio, which we continue to want to make room for as we serve those customers going forward. So all those things sort of fit together in our risk appetite and have -- setting the ALCO considerations aside.

Yesterday, Jamie Dimon talked about the companies in their portfolio having greater access to other financing. That seemed to be -- your trends or commentary was a little different than that. Can you just -- I mean, are there differences in your oil and gas portfolio? Or are you just being cautious here?"

We have a big broad spectrum of upstream, midstream and services companies that includes a lot of middle-market companies, which our entire wholesale portfolio does. So their portfolios are probably different. We are generally cautious, however. I guess, I'd point out that our criticized assets, in sum, there in energy are down by $1.7 billion. Within that, we moved more into nonperforming in the quarter, which we had expected to do in our outlook as we sat here a quarter ago, which is why our reserve didn't have to go up in connection with that. I think we're just a little -- we're a little -- it's a little premature to declare victory because prices are hovering in crude in the $40s. And who knows what the next couple of quarters brings? And we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. We're performing great with 39 basis points of loss all-in with these levels. And so there's no point in declaring victory. We would agree -- if I didn't mention it, it was an oversight. There is a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms. Loans, high yield, high grade and equity were busier in the second quarter than they have been in a while. There are more assets changing hands. Things are freeing up a little bit. And that's going to help with resolutions. We think we've captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but it's true. And it was less true a couple of quarters ago."

Some of that will roll off; some of it we might hang onto for a while, but it's a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation path.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has had -- has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment and deposit balances are all at record levels, and we've maintained our strong risk discipline.
Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, and our pretax pre-provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage while we continued to make investments throughout our businesses. 
Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the primary -- the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge-offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. 
We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholders' equity, which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time, and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which -- where I came from, and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion. Now our stockholders' equity exceeds that, remarkable results over that period of time.
Turning to the economic environment. Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected, putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because, as you know, we are largely a U.S.-centric company, and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the U.S. economy. 
After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers, where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big-ticket items was especially robust, and sentiment surveys show that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise, with the second quarter on pace to have the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. 
Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally, and appreciation isn't just restricted to coastal states. Every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remained solid, with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record, including the strong June report released just last week.
Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announcement we made earlier this week. Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking, who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years, has decided to retire at year-end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise, one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. 
Mary Mack, who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors, will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences, including Retail Banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reins of this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable, long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource. 
I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John?"

My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. Then John and I will answer your questions.
Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth. We increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remained solid, and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter.
On Page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release, while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
Turning to Page 4. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower for longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter, significantly higher than the $5 billion of purchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate decline late in the quarter, driven by the Brexit vote. 
We also added to duration, as we've done in the past, with interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our variable-rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions, we remain asset-sensitive.
Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances, including a 10.7 -- including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC-eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant, including a 100 basis point buffer, which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately 5 years. However, this year, we have a high level of debt maturing so some of our eligible TLAC issuance this year will be used to offset these maturities.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5. Revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call, but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. 
As I mentioned at Investor Day, for several years now, we've been focused on reducing noncore businesses, simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business, and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for a $290 million gain. The go-forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results.
Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that we completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day, the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired, along with corresponding higher operating lease expense. 
The acquisition of the Asia segment of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business was completed on July 1, and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We're pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses, and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year.
As shown on Page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period-end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter. Remember, the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. 
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields.
On Page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14%, driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial Real Estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8%, primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3%, with strong growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued runoff of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7%, with origination volume up 2%, while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10%, reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6%, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago, and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and noninterest income. While the drivers of noninterest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter. 
Market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities, can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market-sensitive results in the second quarter, which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains, was partially offset by lower equity gains. The sum, we're only $85 million higher than the 5-quarter average.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by loan growth, including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income in our investment securities portfolio, reflecting accelerated prepayments, primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets. 
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago, even with an 11 basis point reduction in NIM, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment.
While total noninterest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on our key business drivers, including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity and lease income, reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition. 
Total Mortgage Banking revenue, which includes both the gain on sale from originations and servicing income, declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41%, reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. 
Applications were up 23% from first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we've seen refinance activity increase, with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks. And we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in third quarter compared with the second quarter. 
Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. 
Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments, which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. These MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated. Overall, we're pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter, given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs primarily related to FHA loans.
Other income declined $392 million from first quarter. The reduction was driven by a decline in hedge ineffectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefit services business in the second quarter, with the net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared to the first quarter.
As shown on Page 12, expenses declined $162 million from first quarter, driven by lower personnel expenses, which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million, reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter. 
Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from first quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter, reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge, which became effective July 1.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter, and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.  While we're already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. 
While total expenses have increased, we've reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses has primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending, reflected in higher personnel expense, outside professional services and contract services. We've also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me give you just a few examples. 
During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an online fast-decision loan that's funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In addition, we launched yourFirst Mortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive, with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. 
In Wholesale Banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting iPrint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This slide highlights just a few examples that we've recently announced. We're working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 14. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date Retail Banking household retention in 4 years. 
We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs, because the key to our success is long-lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome e-mail, including a summary of accounts and ways to get the full value from their accounts. 
We're also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel, and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payments. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo as our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015.
We are the #1 debit card issuer by transaction volume, which increased 9% from a year ago, while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago, benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration of Retail Banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However, charge-offs for Wholesale Banking are still historically low, with only 27 basis points of net charge-offs annualized in the second quarter. 
Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and noninterest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Our continued emphasis on meeting our clients' financial needs through plan-based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago, with growth resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisition. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago, and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. 
We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem, who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth.
Turning to Page 17. Credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $38 million from the first quarter, including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio, which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses. 
Nonperforming assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and Commercial Real Estate nonaccruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas nonaccruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build during the quarter, primarily related to loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio. While oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago, there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge-offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter, with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sectors. 
Nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the runoff of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of nonaccruals were current on interest and principal. Most of the losses we've taken were from nonaccruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full. 
Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we're also seeing opportunities, and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. 
Criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter, reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge-offs. And for the first time in the past 6 quarters, we did not have a reserve build for our oil and gas portfolio, and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the increase in energy prices, the slower pace of deterioration in credit quality, improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio. Overall, the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us as -- and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
Turning to Page 19. Our capital levels remained strong, with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of $44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio is 62%, within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. 
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model. We had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We've continued to benefit from executing on our vision, with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions, but we'll continue to focus on what we can control, earning life-long relationships with our customers, which drive our long-term growth opportunities.

Is it continued balance sheet growth? Is it even more disciplined expense management? Is it growth in fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet?

And we've had great success in organic loan growth in commercial categories as well as in consumer categories. So that would be job 1. I think we're seeing nice momentum across a variety of the fee streams that we have. I mentioned some of them in my remarks, but there are many. And we've -- some of them were -- are businesses where we already have complete scale, and some of them are businesses that we're -- where we're under-indexed and continuing to grow. So maybe the long-term opportunity is even bigger. I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we're trying to accomplish in compliance and risk management, but innovate at the same time and stay within our range, which we've managed to do. And we're -- as I also called out, we're sort of -- we're comping over periods where we had been releasing excess allowance and now, because our loan portfolio is growing, we're building some allowance. So we're muscling through that headwind, but we're accomplishing our goals."

Once you get into a rhythm, there's an opportunity to get more eloquent, start to take some of those front-end costs out and build it as part of your process. John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard.

And the things that we're balancing are -- and readjusting constantly are our expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point than waiting a quarter or waiting longer. We're balancing the capital sensitivity of what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates. We're saying we think it's going to be lower for longer, but we have to sensitize ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy, what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So there's a delicate balance going on all the time. But I would say that we're relatively convinced that we may not be this low for forever. But we're -- like we said a year ago, our expectation is lower for longer out the curve, and we're going to keep putting money to work."

I don't know whether aggregate credit creation is outstripping aggregate deposit generation by so much that it's going to cause firms at the margin to raise prices, compete for deposits and drive up the cost for the rest of us. It could happen. We haven't seen it. What we're seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands.

So we've grown deposits even after a runoff of a -- of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion, $500 billion. We're up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits have far outstripped loans in fact. If you believe lower for longer, there's going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while a quarter or 2 might look different, recently, if we look at -- in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans, if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look at it on an organic basis, we're still growing deposits faster.

My sense is that if those loans are priced properly for their risk and given the way that we provide for them as those portfolios grow, that it shouldn't become too much of a headwind. Now we've said earlier that we're happy to provide more reserve, more allowance when we're growing our loan portfolio. That's because it was going to happen as we came out of a period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth.

I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROA than the existing case for most people who've been benefiting from the best of times in credit, but not so meaningfully that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market. We're -- as I mentioned, we're happy with our auto growth. We've maintained our pricing and our risk discipline."

So there's not much limitation on the redeployment of that into HQLA while still satisfying the liquidity coverage ratio. So it really gets back to the when is the right time and how much at that time if you're just, for example, buying treasuries because of the capital implications that it creates by putting more AFS securities on the books. You're that much more exposed to a backup. So there's a trade-off there. For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you're losing the benefit of that liquidity. And we've continued to dimension the ability to move out of cash or HQLA and into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity. You saw what we did last year when we -- or earlier this year as we were sizing up taking the GE assets onto their book -- our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside. And now we're allowing that to run off. It was relatively short term. But it makes sense for us to have ready access to something -- some -- call it $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time.

So I would say that our underwriting approach to commercial real estate tends to be at the conservative end of the spectrum and where we have a reputation, often for better, sometimes to the chagrin of customers, for approaching it that way, which is -- which helps us well through cycles. This is -- as you're alluding to, this is a very cyclical business. It is regional and local. It is property type by property type. There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital, and that creates one sort of outcome. And then there are others where there is just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on and has to be absorbed. That creates a different dynamic. We're seeing that. We have seen that in some multifamily or luxury single-family from market to market. And that -- in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We're taking the same approach that we always have. We're sort of a relatively low loan-to-value lender. We look very hard at in-place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections in our bigger Commercial Real Estate types of financings. And that's -- it's always been true. So I'm sure when the cycle turns, there'll be either property types or geographies where -- that do better or worse. But we're not taking a big change. We're not seeing a big sea change. Our originations have actually -- have been slower, certainly were slower before we bought the seasoned GE portfolio. The organic activity, because of the competitive environment and because of the market circumstances, caused us to slow down there somewhat."

We have a reasonably large allocation to single-family whole loan real estate -- residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio, which we continue to want to make room for as we serve those customers going forward.

We have a big broad spectrum of upstream, midstream and services companies that includes a lot of middle-market companies, which our entire wholesale portfolio does. So their portfolios are probably different. We are generally cautious, however. I guess, I'd point out that our criticized assets, in sum, there in energy are down by $1.7 billion. Within that, we moved more into nonperforming in the quarter, which we had expected to do in our outlook as we sat here a quarter ago, which is why our reserve didn't have to go up in connection with that. I think we're just a little -- we're a little -- it's a little premature to declare victory because prices are hovering in crude in the $40s. And who knows what the next couple of quarters brings? And we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. We're performing great with 39 basis points of loss all-in with these levels. And so there's no point in declaring victory. We would agree -- if I didn't mention it, it was an oversight. There is a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms. Loans, high yield, high grade and equity were busier in the second quarter than they have been in a while. There are more assets changing hands. Things are freeing up a little bit. And that's going to help with resolutions. We think we've captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but it's true. And it was less true a couple of quarters ago."

I think it shows up as long term because it's beyond a year, but shortish-term financing to make sure we had funding in place for the GE assets as they came on. Some of that will roll off; some of it we might hang onto for a while, but it's a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation path.

A lot has happened since our last earnings call, so our formal presentation this morning will be a little bit longer than usual. I couldn't be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing those results more in a few minutes. But I'd like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company. 
This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction. And therefore, the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history. As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.
As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC and the Los Angeles City Attorney related to sales practices in Retail Banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. 
Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building life-long relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank, where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed, along with the entire leadership team, to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers' trust.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by Retail Banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.
On Pages 3 and 4, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.
The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the Retail Banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any 1 quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio because unused deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant.
We've made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on Page 5. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our Retail Banking team members. And next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers. And the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we've made system and process enhancements, including sending automated e-mails, application acknowledgments and multifactor authentication. 
We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year on enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We've implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program, targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We've added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring -- or proactive monitoring. And we're committed to getting it right for our customers.
We're reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card and unsecured line of credit customers. And we're asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of their relationship with Wells Fargo. We have dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we're providing an option of mediation through a third party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling and meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.
Additionally, we've been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were opened but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we're trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened 5 years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we've called 166,000 unactivated customers so far and we've spoken with 34,000 customers who have made the decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.
We're also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We've allocated significant resources to this effort. We're contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval. 
Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than 5 points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We're working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period, where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing and refund any additional cost incurred. As we did with our original account analysis in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right.
We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as transparent as possible, on Page 9, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in Retail Banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it's important to remember that September had 2 fewer business days this year than August. While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we're prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we've observed so far. 
Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remain at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we've received. Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service-, not sales-related. And this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts. We continued to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts. And therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Our deposit customers continued to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago. Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10% and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago. 
We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August but were consistent with where they were as recently as 2 years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August but was also consistent with 2 years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to presettlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.
We're also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on Page 10. Mortgage referrals from Retail Banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long-tenured dealer relationships, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.
Within Wholesale Banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed their relationship with us. Overall, we did not see any meaningful change in business trends in Wholesale Banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. 
We've also seen minimal impact so far within our Wealth and Investment Management business. September ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets, these are the referrals resulting from the Wealth/Community Banking Partnership, were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.
We've always believed that our team members are the most -- are our most important asset. And it's been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the EthicsLine. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who've left Retail Banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company. Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who is the new Head of Community Banking, has met with team members in 10 cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from front-line retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven Community Bank. 
8 additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we're reinforcing our Code of Ethics, Business Conduct, EthicsLine and non-retaliation policies. We're also shifting our language in Retail Banking training and communications to make it more customer-focused, less sales-focused and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.
We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on Slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits. And our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents. We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. And each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in the survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a -- the only mechanism to identify team member concerns like sales practices. And we're implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management. 
Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace-giving campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. We've just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support through their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year. We're also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. 
As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results."

Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual. 
I want to start on Page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best noninterest income results in 5 quarters, including strong mortgage banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at 5-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and a contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved, including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio. And our capital position remained strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Turning to Page 15. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $30.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters but wasn't outsized when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset-sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 16. Revenue increased $166 million from second quarter with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in noninterest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market-sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past 5 quarters, and a decrease in other income, reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by a $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.
As shown on Page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher Commercial Real Estate and C&I loans. Consumer loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities-based lending.
On Page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio. But as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.
As highlighted on Page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers. 
Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and 1 additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM.
Noninterest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business, and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in 5 quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income. Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. 
Applications were up 5% from second quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past 5 quarters, which was 188 basis points.
As shown on Page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters, such as sales practice issues as we've disclosed or as we've disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS; $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth; $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation; and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments. Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense, reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter. And we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on Page 24. We focus on reducing noncore businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We're also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending, such as travel and facilities. 
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams. 
We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in the clearXchange network. And our wholesale customers can now send and receive Same Day ACH. We're also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels, including brokerage, Business Direct and personal credit products.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 25. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call many of the business trends within Community Banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefit services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of the acquisition.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM's average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter, driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to Page 28. Credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or 13% from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses and continued Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.
Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions. Nonaccrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter and criticized loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 30. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to the CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations. I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than 1-year maturity bucket.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices-related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We're working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right."

Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we've been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken.

But there was clearly something wrong, and we will make the necessary changes to fix it. The values we have always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership, will continue to guide our company through this challenging period. 
Second, we've received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the time line of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our Retail Banking sales practices and related matters, and we're not in a position to discuss those topics today. Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earning call 90 days from now.
First, in our Retail Banking business, we'll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders. And third, as you've heard on the call today, we're committed to being transparent regarding business trends. And you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We're also planning on an off-cycle Investor Day for next year, where we will update you on our business strategies. 
And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it."

So that's definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we're seeing, just in terms of account openings, et cetera, don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards and things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, the next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, that some people have asked is what will the business model feel like in Community Banking with a more service-oriented culture rather than a more sales-oriented culture? And you'll be hearing more about that as it's fully developed. It's our intention to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service-oriented model. So that will take some time to develop and to describe for people. And it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters. But it's a question that people have asked and it's one that we'll provide a lot of transparency around so that people can understand the impact of that change as it's being made."

While the first call on that liquidity would be the loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We've -- versus how we've deployed liquidity in the past, we obviously have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we're living in for liquidity. So you've seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You've seen some treasuries, we actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of -- a smaller portfolio on the security side somewhat more credit sensitive, so corporates or CMBS, things like that, that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay. And we have this lower for longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we're wrong about rates so we end up in a higher rate environment. But it's consistent with the approach that we've taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real drop in both market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as well as they have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've been back to converting cash into duration basically. Is that helpful?"

One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forward, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach it. September obviously was the first month, the month where we pulled back on marketing, it's the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go-forward model's going to be as we pivot towards service. It's the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together, and those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it's the installed base that drives the P&L results and that is where it is.

A lot has happened since our last earnings call, so our formal presentation this morning will be a little bit longer than usual. I couldn't be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing those results more in a few minutes. But I'd like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company. 
This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction. And therefore, the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history. As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.
As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC and the Los Angeles City Attorney related to sales practices in Retail Banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. 
Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building life-long relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank, where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed, along with the entire leadership team, to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers' trust.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by Retail Banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.
On Pages 3 and 4, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.
The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the Retail Banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any 1 quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio because unused deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant.
We've made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on Page 5. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our Retail Banking team members. And next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers. And the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we've made system and process enhancements, including sending automated e-mails, application acknowledgments and multifactor authentication. 
We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year on enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We've implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program, targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We've added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring -- or proactive monitoring. And we're committed to getting it right for our customers.
We're reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card and unsecured line of credit customers. And we're asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of their relationship with Wells Fargo. We have dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we're providing an option of mediation through a third party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling and meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.
Additionally, we've been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were opened but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we're trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened 5 years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we've called 166,000 unactivated customers so far and we've spoken with 34,000 customers who have made the decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.
We're also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We've allocated significant resources to this effort. We're contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval. 
Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than 5 points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We're working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period, where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing and refund any additional cost incurred. As we did with our original account analysis in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right.
We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as transparent as possible, on Page 9, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in Retail Banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it's important to remember that September had 2 fewer business days this year than August. While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we're prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we've observed so far. 
Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remain at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we've received. Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service-, not sales-related. And this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts. We continued to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts. And therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Our deposit customers continued to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago. Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10% and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago. 
We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August but were consistent with where they were as recently as 2 years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August but was also consistent with 2 years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to presettlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.
We're also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on Page 10. Mortgage referrals from Retail Banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long-tenured dealer relationships, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.
Within Wholesale Banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed their relationship with us. Overall, we did not see any meaningful change in business trends in Wholesale Banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. 
We've also seen minimal impact so far within our Wealth and Investment Management business. September ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets, these are the referrals resulting from the Wealth/Community Banking Partnership, were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.
We've always believed that our team members are the most -- are our most important asset. And it's been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the EthicsLine. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who've left Retail Banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company. Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who is the new Head of Community Banking, has met with team members in 10 cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from front-line retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven Community Bank. 
8 additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we're reinforcing our Code of Ethics, Business Conduct, EthicsLine and non-retaliation policies. We're also shifting our language in Retail Banking training and communications to make it more customer-focused, less sales-focused and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.
We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on Slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits. And our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents. We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. And each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in the survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a -- the only mechanism to identify team member concerns like sales practices. And we're implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management. 
Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace-giving campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. We've just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support through their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year. We're also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. 
As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results."

Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual. 
I want to start on Page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best noninterest income results in 5 quarters, including strong mortgage banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at 5-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and a contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved, including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio. And our capital position remained strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Turning to Page 15. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $30.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters but wasn't outsized when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset-sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 16. Revenue increased $166 million from second quarter with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in noninterest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market-sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past 5 quarters, and a decrease in other income, reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by a $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.
As shown on Page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher Commercial Real Estate and C&I loans. Consumer loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities-based lending.
On Page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio. But as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.
As highlighted on Page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers. 
Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and 1 additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM.
Noninterest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business, and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in 5 quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income. Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. 
Applications were up 5% from second quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past 5 quarters, which was 188 basis points.
As shown on Page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters, such as sales practice issues as we've disclosed or as we've disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS; $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth; $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation; and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments. Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense, reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter. And we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on Page 24. We focus on reducing noncore businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We're also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending, such as travel and facilities. 
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams. 
We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in the clearXchange network. And our wholesale customers can now send and receive Same Day ACH. We're also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels, including brokerage, Business Direct and personal credit products.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 25. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call many of the business trends within Community Banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefit services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of the acquisition.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM's average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter, driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to Page 28. Credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or 13% from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses and continued Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.
Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions. Nonaccrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter and criticized loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 30. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to the CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations. I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than 1-year maturity bucket.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices-related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We're working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right."

However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our Retail Banking sales practices and related matters, and we're not in a position to discuss those topics today. Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earning call 90 days from now.
First, in our Retail Banking business, we'll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders.

So that's definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we're seeing, just in terms of account openings, et cetera, don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards and things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, the next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, that some people have asked is what will the business model feel like in Community Banking with a more service-oriented culture rather than a more sales-oriented culture? And you'll be hearing more about that as it's fully developed. It's our intention to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service-oriented model. So that will take some time to develop and to describe for people. And it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters. But it's a question that people have asked and it's one that we'll provide a lot of transparency around so that people can understand the impact of that change as it's being made."

We didn't see any trends in any of our wholesale businesses that would cause us concern that Commercial Real Estate loans are going one way or asset-based loans are going another.

Well, the first call on that liquidity would be the loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We've -- versus how we've deployed liquidity in the past, we obviously have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we're living in for liquidity. So you've seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You've seen some treasuries. We've actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of -- a smaller portfolio on the securities side of somewhat more credit-sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that, that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay. We have this lower-for-longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and the liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we're wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it's consistent with the approach that we've taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real drop in both market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as low as they have.

So the accretable yield balance was down $4 billion in the quarter. It stands at about, I think, $11.2 billion right now. So what's happened here is that prepayments have sped up. We've reached a point where a lot of these borrowers have gotten themselves in-the-money for a refis because of the path of HPI, and we're experiencing and modeling faster cash flows as a result of that. And so, frankly, in the near term, I think we'll see an increased interest income as more of that comes through, but what it means is those loans won't be outstanding for as long as you might have previously predicted, because they will be refi'ing."

So it at the margin would be increasing. I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that we've got the capital and earnings power to overcome them. And the magnitude of what we're talking about here, frankly, is, while it's significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR. And of course, what it means from the regulators perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase at the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment, because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But it's a headwind in op risk. We've been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the GSIB peer group over the CCAR era, and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational arm that's been created."

So there's a lot of steps that have to be gone through before applications have an impact on either assets or revenue. One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forward, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach it. September, obviously, was the first month. It's the month where we pulled back on marketing. It's the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go-forward model's going to be as we pivot towards service. It's the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together, and those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it's the installed base that drives the P&L results, and that is where it is. And Tim mentioned that we're going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October, and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend.

But for example, if we get a 25 basis point move in December, that wouldn't be unreasonable, and that's essentially baked into being in that range. If we stay flat, we're not that far off of that. It's not that -- if we had a big move up in rates, which I think is highly unlikely, then that would probably move us down in the range. I think we've said that before."

My guess is that Wells Fargo is going to be different 5 years from now, 10 years from now and 15 years from now. You know what, I hope it is, because by changing and adapting to the environment we're in, that's one of the reasons why we've had a history of success, notwithstanding the last month or so, right? I mean, the last month or so has been a real challenge as we've talked about on the call today, and I'm sure we'll continue to talk about for a while. But we've made some important announcements this week. Again, you might call them tactical. I think they're actually in the strategic band. The creation of a new business line, the elevation of some new senior leaders in our Wholesale Banking and our Community Banking business as well as Consumer Lending. They are going to bring some new ideas. So fair point that it's probably a little bit more tactical than strategic, but over time, you'll see some updates, and we'll talk about those over the next few months.

A lot has happened since our last earnings call, so our formal presentation this morning will be a little bit longer than usual. I couldn't be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing those results more in a few minutes. But I'd like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company. 
This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction. And therefore, the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history. As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.
As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC and the Los Angeles City Attorney related to sales practices in Retail Banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. 
Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building life-long relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank, where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed, along with the entire leadership team, to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers' trust.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by Retail Banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.
On Pages 3 and 4, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.
The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the Retail Banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any 1 quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio because unused deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant.
We've made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on Page 5. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our Retail Banking team members. And next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers. And the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we've made system and process enhancements, including sending automated e-mails, application acknowledgments and multifactor authentication. 
We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year on enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We've implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program, targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We've added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring -- or proactive monitoring. And we're committed to getting it right for our customers.
We're reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card and unsecured line of credit customers. And we're asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of their relationship with Wells Fargo. We have dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we're providing an option of mediation through a third party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling and meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.
Additionally, we've been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were opened but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we're trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened 5 years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we've called 166,000 unactivated customers so far and we've spoken with 34,000 customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.
We're also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We've allocated significant resources to this effort. We're contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval. 
Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than 5 points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We're working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing and refund any additional cost incurred. As we did with our original account analysis in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right.
We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as transparent as possible, on Page 9, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in Retail Banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it's important to remember that September had 2 fewer business days this year than August. While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we're prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we've observed so far. 
Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we've received. Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service-, not sales-related. And this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts. We continued to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts. And therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago. Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10% and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago. 
We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August but were consistent with where they were as recently as 2 years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August but was also consistent with 2 years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to presettlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.
We're also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on Page 10. Mortgage referrals from Retail Banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long-tenured dealer relationships, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.
Within Wholesale Banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed their relationship with us. Overall, we did not see any meaningful change in business trends in Wholesale Banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. 
We've also seen minimal impact so far within our Wealth and Investment Management business. September ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets, these are the referrals resulting from the Wealth/Community Banking Partnership, were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.
We've always believed that our team members are the most -- are our most important asset. And it's been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the EthicsLine. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who've left Retail Banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company. Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who is the new Head of Community Banking, has met with team members in 10 cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from front-line retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven Community Bank. 
8 additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we're reinforcing our Code of Ethics, Business Conduct, EthicsLine and non-retaliation policies. We're also shifting our language in Retail Banking training and communications to make it more customer-focused, less sales-focused and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.
We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on Slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits. And our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents. We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. And each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in the survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a -- the only mechanism to identify team member concerns like sales practices. And we're implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management. 
Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace-giving campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. We've just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support through their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year. We're also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. 
As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results."

Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual. 
I want to start on Page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best noninterest income results in 5 quarters, including strong mortgage banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at 5-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and a contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved, including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio. And our capital position remained strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Turning to Page 15. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $30.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters but wasn't outsized when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset-sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 16. Revenue increased $166 million from second quarter with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in noninterest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market-sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past 5 quarters, and a decrease in other income, reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. The $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by a $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.
As shown on Page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher Commercial Real Estate and C&I loans. Consumer loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities-based lending.
On Page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio. But as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.
As highlighted on Page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers. 
Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and 1 additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14-basis-point reduction in NIM.
Noninterest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business, and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in 5 quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income. Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. 
Applications were up 5% from second quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past 5 quarters, which was 188 basis points.
As shown on Page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters, such as sales practice issues as we've disclosed or as we've disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS; $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth; $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation; and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments. Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense, reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter. And we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on Page 24. We focused on reducing noncore businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We're also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending, such as travel and facilities. 
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams. 
We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in the clearXchange network. And our wholesale customers can now send and receive Same Day ACH. We're also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels, including brokerage, Business Direct and personal credit products.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 25. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call many of the business trends within Community Banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefit services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of the acquisition.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM's average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter, driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to Page 28. Credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or 13% from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses and continued Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.
Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions. Nonaccrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter and criticized loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 30. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to the CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations. I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than 1-year maturity bucket.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices-related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We're working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right."

Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we've been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building life-long relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our business model. But there was clearly something wrong, and we will make the necessary changes to fix it. The values we have always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership, will continue to guide our company through this challenging period. 
Second, we've received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the time line of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our Retail Banking sales practices and related matters, and we're not in a position to discuss those topics today. Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earning call 90 days from now.
First, in our Retail Banking business, we'll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders. And third, as you've heard on the call today, we're committed to being transparent regarding business trends. And you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We're also planning on an off-cycle Investor Day for next year, where we will update you on our business strategies. 
And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it."

So that's definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we're seeing, just in terms of account openings, et cetera, don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, that some people have asked is what will the business model feel like in Community Banking with a more service-oriented culture rather than a more sales-oriented culture. And you'll be hearing more about that as it's fully developed. It's our intention to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service-oriented model. So that will take some time to develop and to describe for people. And it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters. But it's a question that people have asked and it's one that we'll provide a lot of transparency around so that people can understand the impact of that change as it's being made."

Well, the first call on that liquidity would be the loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We've -- versus how we've deployed liquidity in the past, we obviously have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we're living in for liquidity. So you've seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You've seen some treasuries. We've actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of -- a smaller portfolio on the securities side of somewhat more credit-sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that, that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay. We had this lower-for-longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and -- liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we're wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it's consistent with the approach that we've taken over the last couple of quarters.

And the magnitude of what we're talking about here, frankly, is, while it's significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR. And of course, what it means from the regulators' perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase at the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment, because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But it's a headwind in op risk. We've been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the GSIB peer group over the CCAR era, and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational arm that's been created."

One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forward, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach it. September, obviously, was the first month. It's the month where we pulled back on marketing. It's the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go-forward model's going to be as we pivot towards service. It's the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together, and those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it's the installed base that drives the P&L results, and that is where it is.

I couldn't be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing those results more in a few minutes. But I'd like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company. 
This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction. And therefore, the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history. As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.
As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC and the Los Angeles City Attorney related to sales practices in Retail Banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. 
Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building life-long relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank, where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed, along with the entire leadership team, to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers' trust.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by Retail Banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.
On Pages 3 and 4, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.
The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the Retail Banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any 1 quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio because unused deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant.
We've made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on Page 5. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our Retail Banking team members. And next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers. And the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we've made system and process enhancements, including sending automated e-mails, application acknowledgments and multifactor authentication. 
We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year on enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We've implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program, targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We've added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring -- or proactive monitoring. And we're committed to getting it right for our customers.
We're reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card and unsecured line of credit customers. And we're asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of their relationship with Wells Fargo. We have dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we're providing an option of mediation through a third party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling and meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.
Additionally, we've been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were opened but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we're trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened 5 years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we've called 166,000 unactivated customers so far and we've spoken with 34,000 customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.
We're also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We've allocated significant resources to this effort. We're contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval. 
Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than 5 points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We're working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing and refund any additional cost incurred. As we did with our original account analysis in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right.
We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as transparent as possible, on Page 9, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in Retail Banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it's important to remember that September had 2 fewer business days this year than August. While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we're prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we've observed so far. 
Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we've received. Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service-, not sales-related. And this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts. We continued to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts. And therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago. Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10% and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago. 
We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August but were consistent with where they were as recently as 2 years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August but was also consistent with 2 years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to presettlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.
We're also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on Page 10. Mortgage referrals from Retail Banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long-tenured dealer relationships, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.
Within Wholesale Banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed their relationship with us. Overall, we did not see any meaningful change in business trends in Wholesale Banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. 
We've also seen minimal impact so far within our Wealth and Investment Management business. September ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets, these are the referrals resulting from the Wealth/Community Banking Partnership, were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.
We've always believed that our team members are the most -- are our most important asset. And it's been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the EthicsLine. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who've left Retail Banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company. Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who is the new Head of Community Banking, has met with team members in 10 cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from front-line retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven Community Bank. 
8 additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we're reinforcing our Code of Ethics, Business Conduct, EthicsLine and non-retaliation policies. We're also shifting our language in Retail Banking training and communications to make it more customer-focused, less sales-focused and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.
We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on Slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits. And our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents. We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. And each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in the survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a -- the only mechanism to identify team member concerns like sales practices. And we're implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management. 
Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace-giving campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. We've just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support through their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year. We're also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. 
As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results."

Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward.

Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual. 
I want to start on Page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best noninterest income results in 5 quarters, including strong mortgage banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at 5-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and a contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved, including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio. And our capital position remained strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Turning to Page 15. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $30.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters but wasn't outsized when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset-sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 16. Revenue increased $166 million from second quarter with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in noninterest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market-sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past 5 quarters, and a decrease in other income, reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. The $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by a $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.
As shown on Page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher Commercial Real Estate and C&I loans. Consumer loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities-based lending.
On Page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio. But as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.
As highlighted on Page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain Wholesale Banking customers. 
Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and 1 additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14-basis-point reduction in NIM.
Noninterest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business, and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in 5 quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income. Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. 
Applications were up 5% from second quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past 5 quarters, which was 188 basis points.
As shown on Page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters, such as sales practice issues as we've disclosed or as we've disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS; $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth; $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation; and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments. Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense, reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter. And we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on Page 24. We focused on reducing noncore businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We're also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending, such as travel and facilities. 
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams. 
We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in the clearXchange network. And our wholesale customers can now send and receive Same Day ACH. We're also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels, including brokerage, Business Direct and personal credit products.
Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 25. Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call many of the business trends within Community Banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefit services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of the acquisition.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM's average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter, driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to Page 28. Credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or 13% from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses and continued Commercial Real Estate recoveries. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.
Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions. Nonaccrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter and criticized loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.
Turning to Page 30. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to the CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations. I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC-eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than 1-year maturity bucket.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices-related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We're working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right."

Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we've been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building life-long relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our business model. But there was clearly something wrong, and we will make the necessary changes to fix it. The values we have always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership, will continue to guide our company through this challenging period. 
Second, we've received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the time line of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our Retail Banking sales practices and related matters, and we're not in a position to discuss those topics today. Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earning call 90 days from now.
First, in our Retail Banking business, we'll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders. And third, as you've heard on the call today, we're committed to being transparent regarding business trends. And you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We're also planning on an off-cycle Investor Day for next year, where we will update you on our business strategies. 
And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it."

So that's definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we're seeing, just in terms of account openings, et cetera, don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, that some people have asked is what will the business model feel like in Community Banking with a more service-oriented culture rather than a more sales-oriented culture. And you'll be hearing more about that as it's fully developed. It's our intention to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service-oriented model. So that will take some time to develop and to describe for people. And it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters.

Well, the first call on that liquidity would be the loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We've -- versus how we've deployed liquidity in the past, we obviously have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we're living in for liquidity. So you've seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You've seen some treasuries. We've actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of -- a smaller portfolio on the securities side of somewhat more credit-sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that, that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay. We had this lower-for-longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and -- liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we're wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it's consistent with the approach that we've taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real drop in both market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as low as they have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've been back to converting cash into duration basically. Was that helpful?"

And of course, what it means from the regulators' perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase at the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment, because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far.

One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forward, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach it. September, obviously, was the first month. It's the month where we pulled back on marketing. It's the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go-forward model's going to be as we pivot towards service. It's the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together, and those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it's the installed base that drives the P&L results, and that is where it is.
