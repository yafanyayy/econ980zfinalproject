188785,319745593,921509,"State Street Corporation, 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates,",1050,"Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at the energy expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure in revenues. 
In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong business results as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year. 
The challenging conditions notwithstanding overall and disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. 
On a constant currency basis, our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. 
We also fell short on our objective of generating at least 200 basis points deposited fee operating leverage compared to 2014 as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. 
In addition to the challenging revenue environment, we experienced regulatory compliance costs and operating losses at a higher level than expected. 
Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment in our balance sheet optimization actions. 
Our efforts to optimize have been achieved in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, positioning as well for a long-term capital plan. 
Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend to 30% per share in the second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of nearly 14% from 2014 and we bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015. 
As you may have already noted, the fourth quarter's results also include non-items in legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements. 
Now I'd like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business to fewer providers. 
Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion of net outflows from cash mandates, primarily from securities on the cash collateral, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows to EPS. 
Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts in an expected redemption of 1 large supervisory client that is in sourcing our business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. 
Although headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was a positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for , our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs for the further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 launches to 35. 
Significant fourth quarter launches included 3 smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF that immediately whacked on the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015. 
In addition, despite our double line, total return tactical ETF was the top product launch in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion in flows. 
Overall, our SPDR ETF business had 5 of the top 10 new product launches in the U.S. with combined across all new launches of $4.3 billion. 
Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to adjust those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of the year in global market was not been good, but regardless of the implications to revenues, it is our objective district generate positive to the operating leverage. 
We start the year with new assets to be serviced that remained to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31, and we continue to see deep and diversed pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. 
Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long term, will deliver accelerated growth opportunities. 
Knowing we are up to a difficult in 2016, we're focused on identifying leverage to improve our performance our 2016 and help us outperform in the current macroenvironment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multiyear transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. 
We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in annualized pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020, with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016. 
State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage our cloud infrastructure, derive next-generation platform in order to improve scale and flexibility. 
Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across an improvement to phases with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost, client centric, integrated operating model, delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. 
Not only will we continue our firmwide focus on expenses, but we were also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. 
I'm encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work, particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike?"
188785,319745593,921509,"State Street Corporation, 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, our comment on 2 significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results is highlighted on Slide 5. First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approxim",1672,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, our comment on 2 significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results is highlighted on Slide 5. 
First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients, primarily in the U.S, during an 18-year period. 
The current period charge of accrual for interest that we intended to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after-tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning retained earnings balance of our statement of shareholder's equity as of December 31, 2014. 
Please note all prior period financial information within the slide deck and with our -- within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior periods presented. 
In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after-tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. 
Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. 
While 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflected headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014, reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses, particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program. 
Our pretax operating margin of 29.1%, an ROE of 10.7%, decreased relative to 2014. 
Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. 
On a constant currency basis, these grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014. 
Turning to 4Q '15, EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter, an increase from $1.15 in 3Q '15. 
Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014, reflecting management actions to reduce risk weighted assets and also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. 
As we've discussed, we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. 
Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 [ph] million of our common stock. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 4Q '15. 
Servicing fees decreased, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in the lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, continues to negatively impact servicing fees. 
Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 16% while the IFA equity index was down approximately 4%. 
We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets. 
4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows and lower international equity markets. 
Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to lower volatility and volumes. 
Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14, primarily due to new business and enhanced and was higher than 3Q '15, primarily reflecting higher spreads. 
The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '15 at 3Q '15 reflects higher revenues associated to the tax advantage investments. 
It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements have experienced volatility from quarter-to-quarter, was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. 
In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax advanced investment seasonality, so we expect to lower in 1Q '16. 
Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continue to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. 
Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business. 
Now turning to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. 
Importantly, at December 31, our common equity tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach, increased from September 30, principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. 
The December 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to the fourth quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September. 
Moving to Slide 17. Let me review the financial details on the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. 
In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction and force that we announced in 3Q '15. 
In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least $125 million [ph]. 
Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, our ongoing investments to support the program. 
Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020, all else equal. 
To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020, and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24. 
Now let's move on to Slides 18 and 19 for the review of our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business provide solutions to our clients. 
Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. 
Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. 
As a reminder, a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue. 
While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. 
We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. 
Also, it's important to highlight that as in prior years, the first quarter of 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retiring eligible employees, as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. 
We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million. 
As you can see, we developed 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. 
The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increased 25 basis points in both March and June and in the U.K. rates increased 25 basis points in both May and August. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Additionally, we expect the 2006 [ph] operating basis tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%. 
Turning to the last slide. I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including a review by the Federal Reserve board. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to inform all of you that David, the company Treasurer, has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. 
Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved in the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. 
Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30 to ensure an orderly transition to his responsibilities. 
And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer effective February 1. 
Now in addition to a number of other leadership goals and finance, Tracy has had oversight for global treasury for the past 5 years, so we expect her transition to the treasury role to be smooth. 
Dave has developed close relationships with many of you over the last several years. And for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, you'll have the opportunity to wish him well. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

Yes, that's helpful, Brian. I'll handle both those first. In terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly, Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I'm really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast, and that's why we didn't include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. And I'm sure on you that the equity markets thus far in January, for example, are down high single digits and in the emerging markets even worse. And particularly without mix of business, that would be a serious headwind. So instead, we're really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016. Now we recognize that that will be more challenging if, in fact, equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year, but we'll focus on, as Jay said, what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon in savings that we'll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses, but we think it'll be in a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we're really looking at managing really ever expense dollar, and that really relates to your second question, which is in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependent upon our fee revenue. I mean, we intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again, it will be more challenging if the environment is difficult, but that's our plan and that's why we're looking at every area of expenses. We're looking at management layers. We're looking at procurement. We're looking at outside consultants. We're looking at real estate. We're looking at low return businesses. I mean, really, we're looking at entire spectrum with the goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016."

But let me just -- I think this help you understand the pacing. Now if we go back to 5, 6 years ago, we begin with the transformation emphasis on transformation that was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, established Centers of Excellence. And we also introduced the public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes at the next step. And I can emphasize enough that you can't take the second step unless you're successful taking the first step. The second step is too I'd say wired together all of the different systems, which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real-time basis. So in the future state of Beacon, I'll use a simple example in our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade advice coming in from a customer would electronically and real time basis hit the security versus, the cash system, accounting system the pricing on a real time basis. So if you let your mind wonder in a if future's state, that means our whole environment becomes real time and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the intended benefits of obviously cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and systems were fully integrated systems. It also reduces errors and risk, but probably most importantly and I keep finding this strong because everybody fully appreciates the value of real-time information upstream to our customers fund office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera. So that's the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there's a little bit of pump binding that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 and building the systems and the integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slow and then build over time. So the 5 50 you can take the $75 million, 60 [ph], the 1 25 million and 70 [ph], that's just continue to build. I will also say that the trajectory in for a year will probably had a similar path. But Mike I don't know if you'd add any color to that."

So the bottom line is growth savings will be higher than $75 million, but there will be some net spending, which, in particular, is very helpful to position us to get some additional savings in 2017 and 2018, particularly higher than what will deliver in 2016. So the spending I would expect to hit to impact in Q1. And I agree with Jay, the savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and in net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year."

So first of all, in terms of the repositioning in the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have down, in particular, the floating rate assets that are -- have been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we talked about on earlier calls in 2015, and that is -- those are primarily asset-backed securities and they are relatively low spread asset compared to, for example, U.S. Treasury's. They also don't get counted as favorably as treasuries do and they're treated relatively partially in CCAR. Because if you'll recall, the last financial crisis, spreads blew out for those assets. And therefore, the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So the U.S. dollar-based floating-rate securities in particular, which I would characterize it as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that were on the books, say, a year ago. So that's been done major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity. Again, we look at the interest rate sensitivity through several different lenses and I feel very comfortable there's been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle, again, working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints. But I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity."

First, let me just comment on your first piece because I think it was a very important point. And that is as you can imagine, for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into the CCAR. And obviously, we don't have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we're really pleased with the progress that we made and we feel good about the position will be in for the next CCAR. And what pretty good relative to what we've been in if we hadn't reduced the deposits. On your specific question around the income, those income measures are very relevant. The net income measure is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First, the operating income really represents, Ken, our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So if you think about what the next 3 or 4 years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point ideally to grow over the next several years. So I think it's a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that,, net income obviously impacts capital. And so what -- to go on that one issue, the restructuring charges for the FX settlement charges that we took in first and second quarter of 2015 or even this out-of-pocket issue, all of that decreased capital, essentially dollar per dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can because at the end of the day, what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios and in particular, the next CCAR, test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test? So maybe longer way to answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter because the operating income will be more predictive and we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be, but the net income impacts the capital position that we're sitting here with today dollar per dollar."

We estimate that under our historical methodology, our excess deposits average approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we've talked about before, that's the historical definition under the LCR rules, some of what we thought as operational deposits no longer account. So at some point were going to flip over to a definition of nonoperational deposits that, for example, would include the deposits we had with hedge funds and private equity relationships. We need to do know those our mobile operations with our customer relationships there for's LCR purposes the unfounded is nonoperational. But to answer your question factually, $26 billion versus our average at Q2 with $62 billion. So a $36 billion reduction there. On your question on the push harder in the -- about the issue around the press. Well, first of all, Ken, the short answer would be that really pleased with what we've accomplished. And this is not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that's a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good and we got to a win-win with our clients after these -- after all these discussions, we think that is to a little bit point. So I would say at this point, we don't feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were, for example, in Q4, but it is something that we're going to monitor carefully. It is something that subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe, for example, is just not helpful at all. I mean, it used to be cutting the minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of the quantity of. So for all those regions, I think we have to continue to monitor this. But at this point, I feel good about where we are.

From a -- you also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher, at $380 billion. And I think that's probably historically been on the 200 to 300 range.

So I do expect that some piece, although it's certainly not, all but anything, but some piece of the Beacon savings would be offset by the additional growth in regulatory-related expenses that we expect for 2016. And as we've talked about in the past, Brennan, I've walked in to try to give a very specific number on regulatory-related expenses. I just think that at this point, it's truly embedded in the enterprise. I mean, we're all spending more time and attention on regulatory related issues. And I just think, I mean, it would think this sort of massive time and motion of kind of study to give you a number that would accurately portray it. I mean, it's fair to say the significant upward pressure, although as I said, it's really fair to say that we still expect the bulk of the $75 million of the Beacon savings to drop as to the bottom line. Again, all the things equal the conversation that we had earlier."

So the -- just curious if you could help us think about the ETF blows, you had a good December, which certainly helped out on the quarter. But seem like outflows were a little bit of a struggle in ETF front for the SPDR's platform in 2015. So obviously, you guys are working to try to launch new products as an offset there. But can you give us maybe broadly and strategically whether or not you think that's sufficient? Is it all just vanguard and price competition? And given how the legacy for the previous SPDR spot was positioned, you're more subject to that type of competition, which is why you're going in the new direction? And how should we think about seasonal outflows, which is it in the other side of just the seasonal inflows in December?

I'm happy to pick that one up. Let me get some give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of qualitative questions as to where we are in our journey to make ETFs a more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015",484,"Great, Brennan. I'm happy to pick that one up. Let me get some give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of qualitative questions as to where we are in our journey to make ETFs a more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion. Our net outflows this time, which is S&P 500 was outflows of $31 [ph] billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we were net up 8 [ph]. And we were net up 11 in the fourth quarter. So there's a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500, which is a very large fund with very low fees that move a lot because people uses this for liquidity purposes all over the globe. You're right in that we have -- we've been on a 2-year journey to invest in our ETF platform in nearly 2 directions. One is that initially, our ETF orientation was more to institutional market. We've ramped up considerably intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product, which will gets at maybe at the heart of part your question has been away from the more commoditized by product and more to the higher revenue yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote. In 2015, we had 5 of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace. And in fact, we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSgA in 2015. So to me, very good evidence that our strategy have not only building up our distribution sales force, but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta fees, which you tend to read about a lot lately. We think that's a big deal, which is to take ETFs and bond over asset allocation model and package them and sell them through large into intermediary market. We introduced 3 new smart beta ETFs or model portfolios with another name given to that in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make -- next to final point is that we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the double line fund, which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things -- we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute. And I think we're on a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine with an SSgA, but a bigger part of overall State Street. Pleased with the progress."

As I mentioned earlier, the credit spread compression that we've seen in Europe because of the quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean, just to give you a -- perhaps a number of that to help you with our modeling, we estimate that on an all-in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 [ph] million year-over-year, and that's assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today, does not factor in fully additional deterioration.

And we're also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud, meaning that we would own and operate and control it. I think in today is quite a bit different. We would envision that some of the test modules that we would build, we might from a them public cloud that as long as your encrypted data, you're a safe running it out in the public cloud as you are in a private cloud. And I say if you talk to people and are deeply involved in this world, you'd find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plan, some of that has brought in.

We have been resetting over the course of the last 3 months, and that's been helpful in terms of the near term NIR outlook. If we do get additional fed fund increases, again, we expect that to do couple of things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive of NIR because while we share in all likelihood some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage, for example, of the overnight index and with routine portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term, it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates because, Marty, one of the things -- big things that we've done in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About 2/3 of the portfolio is fixed rate, and that's rolling over the yield on the maturing asset has been quite a bit higher, in ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed rate yield of new purchases. So it's interest rate, particularly in that call it 3-year, 5-year, 10-year kind of zone would increase consistently with where the half fed fund rate may increase, that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned that just repeating it. If conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening, that will be very helpful as well."

And there was a short percentage of customers who are holding the lion share of the excess deposits, which made it helpful. But we work with customers over the course of 6 months to make sure, one, they understood the issue in our pressure point and, two, they began to layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we want about it. And also, I think the other thing that's probably safe to say is that we were probably outfront on this. I think everybody else is catching up. So I think this conversation about this excess deposits is not meaningful into State Street anymore, but I think we executed the plan pretty well."

188785,319745593,921621,"State Street Corporation, 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest ra",1064,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at managing energy expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure on revenues. 
In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong new business results as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year. 
The challenging conditions notwithstanding, overall I'm disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the various goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. 
On a constant currency basis, our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. 
We also fell short of our objective of generating at least 200 basis points deposited fee operating leverage compared to 2014, as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. 
In addition to the challenging revenue environment, we experienced regulatory compliance cost and operating losses at a higher level than expected. 
Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment in our balance sheet optimization actions. 
Our efforts to optimize have been on sheet, that resulted in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, positioning as well for our long-term capital plan. 
Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend of $0.34 per share in second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of nearly 14% from 2014, and we bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015. 
As you may have already noted, the fourth quarter's results also include a number of items and legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements. 
Now I'd like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business with fewer providers. 
Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion of net outflows from cash mandates, primarily from securities won in cash collateral, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows to EPS. 
Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts in an expected redemption of 1 large supervisory client that is insourcing their business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and the assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. 
Although headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was a positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business mix. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for SIFI, our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs with a further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 launches to 35. 
Significant fourth quarter launches included 3 smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF that immediately whack on the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015. 
In addition, despite our double line, total return tactical ETF was the top product launch in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion in flows. 
Overall, our SPDR ETF business had 5 of the top 10 new product launches in the U.S. with combined assets gathered across all new launches of $4.3 billion. 
Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to address those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of the year in global markets has not been good. But regardless of the implications to revenues, it is our objective to strive to generate positive fee operating leverage. 
We start the year with new assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31, and we continue to see deep and diversed pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. 
Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long term will deliver accelerated growth opportunities. 
Knowing we are up to a difficult start in 2016, we're focused on identifying leverage to improve our performance in 2016 and help us outperform in the current macro environment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multi-year transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. 
We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in annualized pretax net run-rate expense savings by the end of 2020, with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016. 
State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage our cloud infrastructure to drive next-generation platforms in order to improve scale and flexibility. 
Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across an improvement of phases with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost, client centric, integrated operating model, delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. 
Not only will we continue our firm-wide focus on expenses, but we were also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. 
I'm encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work, particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike?"
188785,319745593,921621,"State Street Corporation, 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone.

Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, our comment on 2 significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results is highlighted on Slide 5. 
First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients, primarily in the U.S, during an 18-year period. 
The current period charge reflects an accrual for interest that we intended to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after-tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning retained earnings balance of our statement of shareholder's equity as of December 31, 2014. 
Please note, all prior period financial information within the slide deck and with our -- within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior period presented. 
In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after-tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. 
Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. 
Both 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflected headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014, reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses, particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program. 
Our pretax operating margin of 29.1%, an ROE of 10.7%, decreased relative to 2014. 
Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. 
On a constant currency basis, these grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014. 
Turning to 4Q '15, EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter, an increase from $1.15 in 3Q '15. 
Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014, reflecting management actions to reduce risk weighted assets and to also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. 
As we've discussed, we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. 
Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 4Q '15. 
Servicing fees decreased, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in the international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, continues to negatively impact servicing fees. 
Compared to the year-ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 16%, while the IFA equity index was down approximately 4%. 
We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets. 
4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows and lower international equity markets. 
Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to the lower volatility and volumes. 
Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14, primarily due to new business and enhanced custody and was higher than 3Q '15, primarily reflecting higher spreads. 
The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '14 at 3Q '15 reflects higher revenue associated with tax advantage to investments. 
It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements within it have experienced volatility from quarter to quarter was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. 
In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax advantage investment seasonality, so we expect this line item to be lower in 1Q '16. 
Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continue to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. 
Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business. 
Now turn to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. 
Importantly, at December 31, our common equity tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach increased from September 30, principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. 
The December 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to the fourth quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September. 
Moving to Slide 17. Let me review the financial details of the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. 
In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction and force that we announced in 3Q '15. 
In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least $125 million. 
Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, our ongoing investments to support the program. 
Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020, all else equal. 
To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020, and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24. 
Now let's move on to Slides 18 and 19 for a review of our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business to provide solutions to our clients. 
Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. 
Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. 
As a reminder, a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue. 
While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. 
We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. 
Also, it's important to highlight that as in prior years, the first quarter of 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retiring eligible employees, as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. 
We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million. 
As you can see, we developed 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. 
The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increased 25 basis points in both March and June, and in the U.K. rates increased 25 basis points in both May and August. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Additionally, we expect the 2006 ( sic ) [ 2016 ] operating basis tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 32%. 
Turning to the last slide. I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including a review by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to inform all of you that David Gutschenritter, the company Treasurer, has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. 
Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved in the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. 
Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30 to ensure an orderly transition to his responsibilities. 
And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer, effective February 1. 
Now in addition to a number of other leadership roles in finance, Tracy has had oversight for global treasury for the past 5 years, so we expect her transition to the Treasurer role to be smooth. 
Dave has developed close relationships with many of you over the last several years. And for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, you'll have the opportunity to wish him well. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

Yes, that's helpful, Brian. I'll handle both of those. First, in terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly, Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I'm really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast, and that's why we didn't include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. And I'm sure it's not lost on you that the equity markets thus far in January, for example, are down high single digits, and in the emerging markets even worse. And particularly with our mix of business, that would be a serious headwind. So instead, we're really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016. Now we recognize that, that will be more challenging if, in fact, equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year, but we're focused on, as Jay said, what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon savings that we'll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses, but we at least think it'll be at a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we're really looking at managing really every expense dollar. And that really relates to your second question, which is in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependent upon our fee revenue. I mean, we intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again, it will be more challenging if the environment is difficult, but that's our plan. And that's why we're looking at every area of expenses. We're looking at management layers. We're looking at procurement. We're looking at outside consultants. We're looking at real estate. We're looking at low return businesses. I mean, really, we're looking at the entire spectrum with a goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016."

I'll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing.

But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to 5, 6 years ago, we begin with the IT and Ops transformation emphasis on transformation. It was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, established Centers of Excellence. And we also introduced the public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes at the next step. And I can't emphasize enough that you can't take the second step unless you've successfully taken the first step. The second step is to, I'd say wired together all of these different systems, which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real-time basis. So in the future state of Beacon, I'll use a simple example in our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade advice coming in from a customer would electronically in real-time basis hit the security system, the cash system, the accounting system and update the pricing on a real-time basis. So if you let your mind wonder in a future state, that means our whole environment becomes real time and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the attendant benefits of, obviously, cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and despaired systems with fully integrated systems. It'll also reduces errors and risk, but probably most importantly, and I keep pounding this strong because I don't know much everybody fully appreciates the value of real-time information upstream to our customers front office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera. So that's the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there's a little bit of pump priming that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 and building the systems and the integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slow and then build over time. So the 5 50 you can take the $75 million, '16, the $125 million in '17, that should continue to build. I would also say that the trajectory in for a year would probably have a similar path. But Mike, I don't know if you'd add any color to that."

So Brian, the additional color that I would give you is, it's important to note that the $75 million is intended to be a net number in terms of our operating expense impact in full year 2016 compared to operating expenses in full year 2015.

So the spending I would expect to hit to impact Q1, and I agree with Jay, the savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and in then net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year."

There was what you called the ongoing repositioning of the investment portfolio. If you look at your appendix slide, it's now 64% fixed rate. So I'm curious on what's driving that change and is it the duration extension on the government side? And does that mean that -- what does that mean for your rate sensitivity?  Sure, Glenn. So first of all, in terms of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have skimmed down, in particular, the floating rate assets that are -- had been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we've talked about on earlier calls in 2015, and that is -- those are primarily asset-backed securities and they are a relatively low spread asset compared to, for example, U.S. Treasuries. They also don't get counted as favorably as U.S. Treasuries do. And they're treated relatively harshly in CCAR, because if you'll recall at the last financial crisis, spreads blew out for those assets. And therefore, the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So that's a -- the U.S. dollar-based floating-rate securities in particular, or I would characterize it as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that were on the books, say, a year ago. So that's been the major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity. Again, we look at the interest rate sensitivity through several different lenses. And I feel very comfortable there's been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle, again, we're working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints. But I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity."

First, let me just comment on your first piece because I think it was a very important point. And that is, as you can imagine for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into the CCAR. And obviously, we don't have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we're really pleased with the progress that we made and we feel good about the position we'll be in for the next CCAR, particularly relative to what we would have been in if we hadn't reduced the deposits. On your specific question around the income, both income measures are very relevant. The net income measure is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First, the operating income really represents, Ken, our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So if you think about what the next 3 or 4 years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point ideally to grow then over the next several years. So I think that's a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that, net income obviously impacts capital. And so left to only that one issue, the restructuring charges or the FX settlement charges that we took in first and second quarter of 2015, or even this out-of-pocket issue, all of that decreased capital, essentially dollar per dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can. Because at the end of the day, what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios, and in particular, the next CCAR test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test. So maybe a longer winded answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter because the operating income will be more predictive, or we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be. But the net income impacts the capital position that we're sitting here with today dollar for dollar."

Now as we've talked about before, that's the historical definition under the LCR rules, s",387,"Sure. So Ken, first to answer your factual question. We estimate that under our historical methodology, our excess deposits averaged approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we've talked about before, that's the historical definition under the LCR rules, some of what we've thought of as operational deposits no longer count. So at some point we're going to flip over to a definition of nonoperational deposits that, for example, would include deposits we have with hedge funds and private equity relationships. And even though those are noble operations with our custody relationships there for LCR purposes they're counted as nonoperational. But to answer your question factually, $26 billion versus our average at Q2 was $62 billion, so a $36 billion reduction there. On your question on the -- we're going push harder in the -- whereabout the issue around press. Well, first of all, Ken, the short answer would be that we're really pleased with what we've accomplished. And this has not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that's a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good that we got to a win-win with our clients after these -- after all these discussions, we think got us to a real good point.
So I would say at this point, we don't feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were, for example, in Q4, but it is something that we're going to monitor carefully. It is something that's subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe, for example, is just not helpful at all. I mean, with the ECB cutting to minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of their quantitative easing. So for all those reasons, I think we have to continue to monitor this. But at this point, I feel good about where we are. Now your question on preps is one of those I can't yet answer fully because we don't have the CCAR stress test. I mean, obviously, we're in much better position. But until we see the dynamics around that stress test and go through that modeling over the next 60 days, I'm just not in a position to give you an estimate at this point."

So to me, the -- it's a little bit indicative of some of the pressure that the asset management industry is under. Not that it's not global, but it's probably a little bit more acute in the U.S. And so the opportunity to do more deeper level of outsourcing as well as consolidate more activities with State Street is probably the underlying theme there. From a -- you also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher, at $380 billion. And I think that's probably, historically, been on the $200 billion to $300 billion range. It's elevated because there's some bigger chunkier deals that had a little longer implementation time line. Those should layer in, in the first couple of quarters of 2016. Additionally, I would say from an outlook pipeline standpoint, actually quite good, with some different color from the U.S. to the Europe to Asia. Asia continues to be moving in a pretty positive line. Europe is again dominated by the offshore markets, which is where all the action is coming from.

Let me give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of your qualitative questions as to where we are in our journey to make ETFs a more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion. Our net outflows of the SPY, which is the S&P 500, was outflows of $31 billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we were net up $8 billion. And we were net up $11 billion in the fourth quarter. So there's a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500, which is a very large fund with fairly low fees that move a lot because people use it for liquidity purposes all over the globe. You're right in that we have -- we've been on a 2-year journey to invest in our ETF platform in really 2 directions. One is that initially, our ETF orientation was more to the institutional market. We've ramped up considerably our intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product, which really gets at maybe the heart of one of your questions, has been away from the more commoditized-type product and more towards the higher revenue-yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote. In 2015, we had 5 of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace. And in fact, we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSgA in 2015. So to me, very good evidence that our strategy of not only building up our distribution sales force, but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta theme, which you tend to read about a lot lately. We think that's a big deal, which is to take ETFs and bundle them in an asset allocation model and package them and sell them through largely the intermediary market. We introduced 3 new smart beta ETFs, or model portfolios is another name given to that, in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make -- next to final point is that we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the DoubleLine fund, which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things -- we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute. And I think we're on a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine within SSgA, but a bigger part of overall State Street. Pleased with the progress."

Second, importantly, the 10-Q disclosures are for a consistent interest rate change globally. And I would tell you that, that is, in my view, highly unlikely to be the case in Europe. I mean, the ECB now has cut rates to minus 30. There's talk about cutting that further. As I mentioned earlier, the credit spread compression that we've seen in Europe because of their quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean, just to give you a -- perhaps a number to help you with the modeling, we estimate that on an all-in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 million year-over-year, and that's assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today. It does not factor in fully additional deterioration. So yes, it is the case that we would expect things to be stronger in the U.S., but that's a headwind.

And we're also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud, meaning that we would own and operate and control it. Our thinking today is quite a bit different. We would envision that, for instance, some of the test modules that we would build, we might rent it on a public cloud that as long as you encrypt the data, you're as safe running it out on the public cloud as you are in a private cloud. And I'd say if you talk to people that are deeply involved in this world, you'd find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plans, some of that has bled in. But I think for us to imagine what the technology enablements will be 5 years out is pretty tough to do. I think, though, it gets back to a point that I made and you reinforced, which is unfortunately you can't leap frog. So you have to modify along the way. And we think we've got a plan that not only enables us to get to that future real estate, but it will also allow us to take advantage of advances in technology as they unfold over the next 5 years."

First, I'm really reluctant to try to give you specific comparisons to our various benchmark competitors. I mean, our business mix is very different. As you correctly pointed out, we've tended to have more impact from changes in Europe than our competitors. Over the long term, I think that served us well. But in near term, that's a pressure point. We have different portfolios. We have different mixes of business that those portfolios back. So again, I hesitate to try to give you a very specific comparison because I don't know specifically how they're managing their balance sheet. What I can tell you is how we're managing our balance sheet. And in terms of the catalysts, as we talked about, we do expect that the recent increase in the Fed Funds rate to be particularly helpful that, for example, even though it's just for the U.S. dollars, it does mean that the floating rate assets that we have that are dollar denominated have been resetting over the course of the last 3 months, and that's been helpful in terms of the near-term NIR outlook. If we do get additional Fed Fund increases, again, we expect that to do a couple things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive to NIR because while we share, in all likelihood, some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage, for example, of the overnight index and would retain a portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term, it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates because, Marty, one of the things -- big things that weighed on us in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About 2/3 of the portfolio is fixed rate, and that's been rolling over. The yield on the maturing assets has been quite a bit higher, ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed-rate yield of new purchases. So if interest rates, particularly in that call it 3-year, 5-year, 10-year kind of zone, would increase consistently with where the Fed Fund rate may increase, that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned that just repeating it. If conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening, that would be very helpful as well."

And I think that what I think we did well is we got way out in front of this. So it was really the beginning of 2015, where we began to have a series of conversations with our customers. And there was a shorter percentage of customers who are holding the lion's share of the excess deposits, which made it helpful. But we work with customers over the course of 6 months to make sure, one, they understood the issue and our pressure point, and two, begin to layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we went about it. And also, I think the other thing that's probably safe to say is that we were probably upfront on this. I think everybody else is catching up.

Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest ra",1060,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. 
Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015, including the challenging global equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at managing energy expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure on revenues. 
In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong new business results, as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year. 
The challenging conditions notwithstanding, overall I'm disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the various goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. 
On a constant currency basis, our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. 
We also fell short of our objective of generating at least 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage compared to 2014, as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. 
In addition to the challenging revenue environment, we experienced regulatory compliance cost and operating losses at a higher level than expected. 
Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment and our balance sheet optimization actions. 
Our efforts to optimize our balance sheet have resulted in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, positioning as well for our long-term capital plan. 
Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend to $0.34 per share in second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of nearly 14% from 2014, and we bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015. 
As you may have already noted, the fourth quarter's results also include a number of items and legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements.
Now I'd like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business with fewer providers.
Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion of net outflows from cash mandates, primarily from securities [indiscernible] cash collateral, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows to ETFs. 
Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts in an expected redemption of one large supervisory client that is insourcing their business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016, and the assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. 
Although headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was a positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business mix.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for SPY, our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs with a further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 launches to 35. 
Significant fourth quarter launches included 3 smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF that immediately rank in the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015.
In addition, despite our DoubleLine, total return tactical ETF was the top product launch in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion in flows. 
Overall, our SPDR ETF business had 5 of the top 10 new product launches in the U.S., with combined assets gathered across all new launches of $4.3 billion.
Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to address those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of the year in global markets has not been good. But regardless of the implications to revenues, it is our objective to strive to generate positive fee operating leverage. 
We start the year with new assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31, and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. 
Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long term will deliver accelerated growth opportunities. 
Knowing we were up to a difficult start in 2016, we're focused on identifying levers to improve our performance in 2016 and help us outperform in the current macro environment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multi-year transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. 
We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in annualized pretax net run-rate expense savings by the end of 2020, with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016.
State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage our cloud infrastructure to drive next-generation platforms in order to improve scale and flexibility. 
Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across and improve interfaces with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost, client-centric, integrated operating model, delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. 
Not only will we continue our firm-wide focus on expenses, but we were also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. 
I'm encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work, particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter, and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike?"

Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'll comment on 2 significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results, as highlighted on Slide 5. 
First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients, primarily in the U.S., during an 18-year period. 
The current period charge reflects an accrual for interest that we intend to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after-tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning retained earnings balance of our statement of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2014. 
Please note, all prior period financial information within this slide deck and with our -- within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior period presented. 
In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after-tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. 
Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. 
Both 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflected headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014, reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses, particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program. 
Our pretax operating margin of 29.1% and ROE of 10.7% decreased relative to 2014. 
Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. 
On a constant currency basis, fees grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014. 
Turning to 4Q '15, EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter, an increase from $1.15 in 3Q '15. 
Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014, reflecting management actions to reduce risk-weighted assets and to also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. 
As we've discussed, we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. 
Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 4Q '15. 
Servicing fees decreased, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in the international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, continues to negatively impact servicing fees. 
Compared to the year-ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 16%, while the IFA equity index was down approximately 4%. 
We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets. 
4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows and lower international equity markets. 
Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to the lower volatility and volumes. 
Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14, primarily due to new business and enhanced custody and was higher than 3Q '15, primarily reflecting higher spreads. 
The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '14 and 3Q '15 reflects higher revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments. 
It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements within it, that experienced volatility from quarter to quarter, was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. 
In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax-advantaged investment seasonality, so we expect this line item to be lower in 1Q '16. 
Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continue to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. 
Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business. 
Now turn to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. 
Importantly, at December 31, our common equity tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach increased from September 30, principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. 
The December 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to the full quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September. 
Moving to Slide 17. Let me review the financial details of the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. 
In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction in force that we announced in 3Q '15. 
In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least $125 million. 
Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings are ongoing investments to support the program. 
Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020, all else equal. 
To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020, and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24. 
Now let's move on to Slides 18 and 19 for a review of our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business to provide solutions to our clients. 
Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. 
Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. 
As a reminder, a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue. 
While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. 
We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. 
Also, it's important to highlight that, as in prior years, the first quarter of 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retiring eligible employees, as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. 
We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million. 
As you can see, we've developed 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. 
The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both March and June, and in the U.K., rates increase 25 basis points in both May and August. 
Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Additionally, we expect the 2006 (sic) [2016] operating basis tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 32%. 
Turning to the last slide. I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including a review by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to inform all of you that David Gutschenritter, the company Treasurer, has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. 
Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved and the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. 
Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30 to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities. 
And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer, effective February 1. 
Now in addition to a number of other leadership roles in finance, Tracy has had oversight for global treasury for the past 5 years, so we expect her transition to the Treasurer role to be smooth. 
Dave has developed close relationships with many of you over the last several years. And for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, you'll have the opportunity to wish him well. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

Yes, that's helpful, Brian. I'll handle both of those. First, in terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly, Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I'm really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast, and that's why we didn't include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. And I'm sure it's not lost on you that the equity markets thus far in January, for example, are down high single-digits, and in the emerging markets, even worse. And particularly with our mix of business, that would be a serious headwind. So instead, we're really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016. Now we recognize that, that will be more challenging if, in fact, equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year, but we're focused on, as Jay said, what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon savings that we'll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses, but we at least think that will be at a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we're really looking at managing, really, every expense dollar. And that really relates to your second question, which is in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependent upon fee revenue. I mean, we intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again, it would be more challenging if the environment is difficult, but that's our plan. And that's why we're looking at every area of expenses. We're looking at management layers. We're looking at procurement. We're looking at outside consultants. We're looking at real estate. We're looking at low-return businesses. I mean, really, we're looking at the entire spectrum with a goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016."

I'll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to 5, 6 years ago, we began, with the IT and Ops transformation, emphasis on transformation. It was r",398,"Brian, let me start that. I'll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to 5, 6 years ago, we began, with the IT and Ops transformation, emphasis on transformation. It was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, established Centers of Excellence. And we also introduced the public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes it the next step. And I can't emphasize enough that you can't take the second step unless you've successfully taken the first step. The second step is to, I'd say wire together all of these different systems, which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real-time basis. So in the future state of Beacon, I'll use a simple example in our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade advice coming in from a customer would electronically in real-time basis hit the security system, the cash system, the accounting system and update the pricing on a real-time basis. So if you let your mind wander, in a future state, that means our whole environment becomes real-time, and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the attendant benefits of, obviously, cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and disparate systems with fully integrated systems. It'll also reduces errors and risk, but probably most importantly, and I keep pounding this drum because I don't know how much everybody fully appreciates the value of real-time information upstream to our customers front office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera. So that's the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there's a little bit of pump priming that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 in building the systems and integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slow and then build over time. So the 5 50 you can take the $75 million, '16, the $125 million in '17, that should continue to build. I would also say that the trajectory intra-year would probably have a similar path. But Mike, I don't know if you'd add any color to that."

So the bottom line is growth savings will be higher than $75 million, but there will be some net spending, which, in particular, is very helpful to position us to get some additional savings in 2017 and 2018. It's even higher than what we'll deliver in 2016. So the spending I would expect to hit -- to impact Q1. And I agree with Jay. The savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and then net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year."

So first of all, in terms of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have skimmed [ph] down, in particular, the floating rate assets that are -- had been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we've talked about on earlier calls in 2015, and that is those are primarily asset-backed securities. And they are a relatively low-spread asset compared to, for example, U.S. Treasuries. They also don't get counted as favorably as U.S. Treasuries do. And they're treated relatively harshly in CCAR, because if you'll recall at the last financial crisis, spreads blew out for those assets. And therefore, the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So that's a -- the U.S. dollar-based floating-rate securities in particular are -- I would characterize it as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that were on the books, say, a year ago. So that's been the major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity. Again, we look at the interest rate sensitivity through several different lenses. And I feel very comfortable. There's been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle. Again, it -- we're working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints. But I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity."

First, let me just comment on your first piece, because I think it was a very important point. And that is, as you can imagine for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into the CCAR. And obviously, we don't have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we're really pleased with the progress that we made, and we feel good about the position we'll be in for the next CCAR, particularly relative to what we would have been in if we hadn't reduced the deposits. On your specific question around the income, both income measures are very relevant. The net income measure is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First, the operating income really represents, Ken, our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So if you think about what the next 3 or 4 years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point, ideally to grow then over the next several years. So I think that's a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that, net income obviously impacts capital. And so left to only that one issue, the restructuring charges or the FX settlement charges that we took in first and second quarter of 2015, or even this out-of-pocket issue, all of that decreased capital, essentially dollar per dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can, because at the end of the day, what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios, and in particular, the next CCAR test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test. So that's maybe a longer-winded answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter because the operating income will be more predictive, or we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be. But the net income impacts the capital position that we're sitting here with today dollar for dollar."

We estimate that under our historical methodology, our excess deposits averaged approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we've talked about before, that's the historical definition under the LCR rules. Some of what we've thought of as operational deposits no longer count. So at some point we're going to flip over to a definition of nonoperational deposits that, for example, would include deposits we have with hedge funds and private equity relationships. And even though those are mobile operations with our custody relationships there, for LCR purposes they're counted as nonoperational. But to answer your question factually, $26 billion versus our average at Q2 was $62 billion, so a $36 billion reduction there. On your question on the, are we going push harder and the -- what about the issue around press. Well, first of all, Glenn -- or Ken, the short answer would be that we're really pleased with what we've accomplished. And this has not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that's a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good that we got to a win-win with our clients after these -- after all of these discussions, we think, got us to a real good point. 
So I would say at this point, we don't feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were, for example, in Q4, but it is something that we're going to monitor carefully. It is something that's subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe, for example, is just not helpful at all. I mean, with the ECB cutting to minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of their quantitative easing. So for all those reasons, I think we have to continue to monitor this. But at this point, I feel good about where we are. Now your question on press is one of those I can't yet answer fully because we don't have the CCAR stress test. I mean, obviously, we're in much better position. But until we see the dynamics around that stress test and go through that modeling over the next 60 days, I'm just not in a position to give you an estimate at this point."

Not that it's not global, but it's probably a little bit more acute in the U.S. And so the opportunity to do more a deeper level of outsourcing as well as consolidate more activities with State Street is probably the underlying theme there. From a -- you also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher, at $380 billion. And I think that's probably, historically, been in the $200 billion to $300 billion range. It's elevated because there's some bigger chunkier deals that have a little longer implementation time line. Those should layer in, in the first couple of quarters of 2016. Additionally, I would say from an outlook pipeline standpoint, actually quite good, with some different color from the U.S. to the Europe to Asia. Asia continues to be moving in a pretty positive line. Europe is again dominated by the offshore markets, which is where all the action is coming from.

Let me give you some numbers, and then maybe I'll get to some more of your qualitative questions as to where we are in our journey to make ETFs a more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion. Our net outflows of the SPY, which is the S&P 500, was outflows of $31 billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we were net up $8 billion. And we were net up $11 billion in the fourth quarter. So there's a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500, which is a very large fund with fairly low fees that move a lot because people use it for liquidity purposes all over the globe. You're right in that we have -- we've been on a 2-year journey to invest in our ETF platform in really 2 directions. One is that initially, our ETF orientation was more to the institutional market. We've ramped up considerably our intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product, which really gets at maybe the heart of one of your questions, has been away from the more commoditized-type product and more towards the higher revenue-yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote. In 2015, we had 5 of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace. And in fact, we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSgA in 2015. So to me, very good evidence that our strategy of not only building up our distribution sales force but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta theme, which you tend to read about a lot lately. We think that's a big deal, which is to take ETFs and bundle them in an asset allocation model and package them and sell them through largely the intermediary market. We introduced 3 new smart beta ETFs, or model portfolios is another name given for that, in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make -- next to final point is that we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the DoubleLine fund, which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things -- we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute. And I think we're on a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine within SSgA, but a bigger part of overall State Street. Pleased with the progress."

So is that a change in deposit outflow assumptions or is it just timing in terms of the remaining 6 months of the year versus the full 12 months and beyond? How should we think about your NII leverage, given your 10-Q disclosures, which are much more significant?"

And we do anticipate, with a couple more hikes, for excess deposits in particular to come off the balance sheet. Second, importantly, the 10-Q disclosures are for a consistent interest rate change globally. And I would tell you that, that is, in my view, highly unlikely to be the case in Europe. I mean, the ECB now has cut rates to minus 30. There's talk about cutting that further. As I mentioned earlier, the credit spread compression that we've seen in Europe because of their quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean, just to give you a -- perhaps a number to help you with the modeling, we estimate that on an all-in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 million year-over-year, and that's assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today. It does not factor in fully additional deterioration. So yes, it is the case that we would expect things to be stronger in the U.S., but that's a headwind. And again, relative to full year 2015, the decline in the excess deposits would also be a headwind to NIR.

And if it's all real time, you have minimal human intervention, you have all the intended benefits of it. And in my mind, as we get out to 2020, we should largely be there, not that there won't be -- I'd say if there was a Stage 3, it would be more revenue-oriented. Once we can create a real-time infrastructure here, the opportunity to build systems, to build capabilities, to generate global exchange-type opportunities is probably where the next big move is.

But I would fully expect that as we get out in years that technology advances will cause us to make adjustments to the plan. And I'll just give you an example, Gerard, that hopefully will resonate. When we went into the ITOT, as we call it, we were very determined that we wanted to create a cloud environment and were also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud, meaning that we would own and operate and control it. Our thinking today is quite a bit different. We would envision that, for instance, in some of the test modules that we would build, we might run it on a public cloud that as long as you encrypt the data, you're as safe running it out on a public cloud as you are on a private cloud. And I'd say if you talk to people that are deeply involved in this world, you'd find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plan, some of that has bled in. But I think for us to imagine what the technology enablements will be 5 years out is pretty tough to do. I think, though, it gets back to a point that I made and you reinforced, which is unfortunately you can't leapfrog. So you have to modify along the way.

First, I'm really reluctant to try to give you specific comparisons to our various benchmark competitors. I mean, our business mix is very different. As you correctly pointed out, we've tended to have more impact from changes in Europe than our competitors. Over the long term, I think that's served us well. But in near term, that's a pressure point. We have different portfolios. We have different mixes of business that those portfolios back. So again, I would hesitate to try to give you a very specific comparison because I don't know specifically how they're managing their balance sheet. What I can tell you is how we're managing our balance sheet. And in terms of the catalysts, as we talked about, we do expect that the recent increase in the Fed Funds rate to be particularly helpful, that, for example, even though it was just for the U.S. dollars, it does mean that the floating rate assets that we have that are dollar denominated have been resetting over the course of the last 3 months. And that's been helpful in terms of the near-term NIR outlook. If we do get additional Fed Fund increases, again, we expect that to do a couple of things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive to NIR, because while we'll share, in all likelihood, some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage, for example, of the overnight index and would retain a portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term, it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates because, Marty, one of the things -- big things that weighed on us in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About 2/3 of the portfolio is fixed rate, and that's been rolling over. The yield on the maturing assets has been quite a bit higher, ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed-rate yield of new purchases. So if interest rates, particularly in that, call it, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year kind of zone, would increase consistently where the Fed Fund rate may increase, that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned and I'm just repeating it, if conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening, that would be very helpful as well."

But we worked with customers over the course of 6 months to make sure, one, they understood the issue and our pressure point and, two, began to layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we went about it.

Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us t",1149,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in the new environment and deliver value on the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are one to become a digital leader in financial services, to drive growth from our core franchise, to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation, increase our focus on expense management and then leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders.
As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined some new highlights of our progress so far this year against those 5 priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing and becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon. Our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run-rate expense savings by the end of 2020. Our clients are already beginning to see the results of our investments through a faster and more consistent delivery of services, impacting our client operations and driving improved ranking in distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as [indiscernible].
We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon-related annualized run rate savings at $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated, it could be to case at our Investor Day, we could take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million and the course of first quarter related to Beacon.
Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth given our leading positions in attractive markets. Although our first quarter key revenue reflect the challenging market environment experienced in the early part of the year, I'm encouraged by the size of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm. The first quarter included new asset service of $264 billion at approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter-end to be installed from current and prior periods.
I want to highlight a win that our global services group in Asia-Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we to be the massive facilities for Australia's third-largest superannuation fund, First Aid Super. This new relationship will also expand in our global markets and global chains businesses. Of note, State Street now services 4 of the 7 largest super funds and what is a high growth sector for us in Australia. I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business had met inflows of $13 billion with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter, providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. Net activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows from EPS and $11 billion of inflows into cash products.
Third,, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire ETF Management support that strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly requisition I outsource CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business. Additionally, GE Asset management expands SSGA alternative capabilities while enhancing our equity and fixed income teams, which part of the solution set combined with our client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high quality organization with strong cultural with SSGA. And this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing strong long-term relationship with the GE. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meaning strategic or financial expectations. We made a decision during the quarter to exit our Futures Clearing business. At the begin of the second quarter, we completed the sale of the branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return to capital actions are improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term.
Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSGA. Our SSGA SPDR business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter, including the SSGA gender diversity ETF. She is the first self index ETF and this development was inspired by efforts to move diversity in corporate America, and seeks to track performance of the SSGA gender diversity index, which comprises largely U.S. large-cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on the boards of directors and in their senior leadership.
Forth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflected our commitment to manage expenses with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago, and also flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees in Taylor Texas compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture and current employees to embrace its mindset and identify ways we can reduce costs across the enterprise. Looking at everything from travel to consultant spend.
As I noted earlier, State Street's contributed to our expense management effort, and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pre-tax net run-rate expense savings this year from the program.
And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. By June -- first quarter '16, common stock dividend was $0.34 per share, and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q '16.
In this review for you we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth which is to achieve our objective of generating positive fee basis operating leverage this year balance [indiscernible] 2015.
2 weeks ago, the Federal Reserve and FDIC released a review of our July 2015 ROT signature. Both the Federal Reserve and FDIC know we have made improvement over our prior plans, but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we're committed to addressing the issues in advancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve. In fact, ongoing communications with the regulator and our focus on addressing all the deficiencies duly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1st, 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the first quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions."
188785,330371054,964107,"State Street Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter, included pretax restructuring cost of $97 million related to State Street Beacon including the exit of our Futures Clearing business.
Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q '16. 1Q '16 results reflect softness in our fee revenue, primarily driven by lower global equity markets partially offset by strong expense control.
Operating basis EPS for 1Q '16 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q '15 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q '15. Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes.
Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year-ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonable retirement eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q '15. [indiscernible] capital in 1Q '16, we've cleared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock.
Moving now to Slide 9. 1Q '16 fee revenue decreased 3.6%, while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q '15 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss financial bank actions at a time, contributed to the decrease of fee revenue relative to the year-ago quarter.
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q '16 operating business revenues. Servicing fees decreased from a year-ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 22%, while the ETF equity index was down approximately 12%.
Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, reflecting global equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign-exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q '15 to the lower volatility and volumes, nevertheless, it increased relative to 4Q '15.
Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. The increase of over periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending.
Compared to the 4Q '15, processing and other revenue decreased reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax and management investments.
Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis 1Q '16 net interest revenue benefited from the higher hedge funds rate and discipline liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from a year ago, primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q '16 or approximately flat relative to 1Q '15, a notable accomplishment.
Compensation fee benefits were impacted by the seasonal, deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Demonstrating solid expense control, the other expense category, decreased significantly as compared to 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. Compared to 4Q '15, lower other expenses were given lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement in the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Now turning to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remains strong, which is enable us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under Basel 3 fully based in advance approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach. Importantly, the March 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the back increased 6.2%, primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital.
We purchased $225 million of common stock in 1Q '16 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q '16. This will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q '16 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchase amount is, therefore, consistent with the capital plan.
Moving onto the next slide, let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE Asset Management. While it remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to hire growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 billion subject to adjustments with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS from the first 12-month period following the close of transaction and we're targeting a client asset retention lead of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition was significantly enhanced State Street's position in the fast-growing outsourced chief investment outsourcing market.
Moving to Slide 17. I will now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March. On expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expenses of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run-rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016.
Now as a reminder, a pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect that growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments.
In addition, we continue to have 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario was to use market interest rates static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly, market rates to trend higher from March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be the range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders from share repurchase and dividends remains a priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including the review by the Federal Reserve Board.
In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q '16 results, we're encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses in providing solutions to our clients.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Jay."

First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating-rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we had here in the U.S. that includes the summit securities and the securities portfolio, about half of the folding rate securities are in US dollars, so that's approximately $18 billion. And then we also -- our loans tend to be also a floating-rate asset. So basically, the floating-rate in our balance sheet increased as you would expect based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates. In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo and we also saw increased netting for repo. So those 2 things combined increased, what you see on the average rates earned and paid page, that increased significantly average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category. And then in the other interest earning asset line that we specifically asked about, that's our Enhanced Custody asset and basically, that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher."

So I mentione",294,"Sure. The couple of things that we expect in the static rates that -- the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under our static scenario would be number one the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is forwarding rate, about half of that is in the U.S. have benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rates on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher revenue in the new fixed rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative. As we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only our short-term interest rates negative with the ECB but in addition to that because of the quantitative ECB program over there, spreads are really keen as well. So the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in static rates scenario, we would expect those to be to big drivers of the lower NIR in the next [indiscernible] of the quarters. If instead through, we get a couple of more fund hikes. We would expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in first quarter but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful is to get a higher rate on the floating rate assets as we mentioned and in response to this question."

But I do expect that there'll be a March up in regulatory expenses in Q2, Q3, Q4 as a result of dealing with the higher expectation. Now having said that, we will continue to look at every area of expense as Jay talked about, Project Beacon continues to be on track for the expected $100 million of savings for the full year. But again, between the regulatory cost and the net new business that we expect to be coming on board that will lead expense to service here, we thought it made sense to stick with the up to or to say, up to 2% on expense growth. And obviously, a lot of the when will also relate to the where the fee revenue is going to end up as well."

Now you've seen not just this quarter but progressive quarters, good performance, outperformance in the securities lending and you're right this quarter is a combination of agency and enhanced custody. But I would say, over a longer cycle is really been Enhanced Custody that's driven this proportionate growth, and we expect that to continue. There continues to be high demand not only hedge but in a traditional client face to use Enhanced Custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit, and we don't see much limitation. I'd say, most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter is existing clients doing more credit extension with us.

The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive opposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we see continued demand. We don't see much in a way of capacity constraints. We think we figured out how to make this attractive from a return of capital standpoint."

As you point out, a good deal of the assets, GE assets, both pension which how the whole thing got started outsourcing the CIO function of GE's pension assets. But they've also been successful on attracting some other big names in the outsource CIO market place. So I think that if you just look at that segment of the market, particularly against an environment where rates are likely to be low for an attractive period of time, we think that's a growth market. And we think by kind of an shackling GE from GE and making it part of State Street, that will be a more attractive provider of services and outsource CIO markets. So they've had some growths of their own, we've also had some growth by combining them with grow at faster rate. So that's part growth opportunity. But also core of the growth opportunities, you've head us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions, and whether it's a target fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we have a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes particularly, alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all 3, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth. So it's really taking, I'd say, a very high-quality and stable asset management organization embedding it at State Street and 2 synergies on the revenue side and all CIO solutions segment of the market."

We were able to capture that in our margin. The thing that makes the average rate jump as much as it did though is that we also expanded netting in the quarter. So as a result, we actually had expanded activity of clients in the quarter, but we were able to net more of it so the average balance you see there dropped by about $0.5 billion or about 16% sequentially, but it was -- that was really from the netting. So the overall activity expanded, the spreads expanded but as a result, the average balance dropped.

We are watching appropriately a lot of attention, and I think, to me it's an synonymous with digitization, generally. I think if I would have put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and longchain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the 4 walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized, and that's going to required standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I se blockchain being most relevant. We have internally, within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's 4 maybe 5 pilots going on, to use blockchain SMEs to digitize within State Street linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example and maybe the most easily explained slide example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market, and processing of bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing where we're using blockchain. Then we have agreements from all of the counterparties to participate in a blockchain pilot around bank loan processing. So with that would do and take an activity in process improvement and technology that do we need to do internally with State Street but it would extend it to other counterparties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we digitize our own environment, but it will require a standard across the industry and again, blockchain maybe one of those. We are participating in a group called I think it's 16 banking institutions trying to figure out what the application, the best applications are to use blockchain in order to get standard intercompany, interindustry. And so, I think, it's patchwork and absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the areas if we can get standards develop on how we cooperate from a digital standpoint. And I think blockchain could be, if it's not blockchain, it could be something else, one of those standards that emerge that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. Is that kind of confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We control and that's what we're doing with Beacon, but in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize. The blockchain."

And I say a lot of the basic data strategies have been consumed in an ECF product. But then you get to the next level of customized indexes. So the she Index that we -- that I describe in my prepared comments is using a developing strategy in this case which is the first time we have self index. So we built the index, back tested it and then packaged it and the ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening, in fact, we're not the only ones doing that I think in the broad beta and ETF space, that's the theme. The other thing I would say is that I'd point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine. They're taking active fixed-income strategies, they have a manager and we're packaging it in the ETF and distributing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional products spaces. And I come a little short as I'm not quite sure you'll take active equity product, for instance, in rapid and in ETF. But others will take the other side of that argument. So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to being wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions in the retail market space. So we have, I would say, that SSgA has an open platform strategy where if we can create that index in the case of she manufacturing and distributor, and we will, but if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSgA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing, which we've done not just with DoubleLine but with [indiscernible] and several other firms."

188785,330371054,964670,"State Street Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone.Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to",1167,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone.
Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in a new environment and deliver value on the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are: one, to become a digital leader in financial services; to drive growth from our core franchise; to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation; increase our focus on expense management; and leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders.
As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined for you highlights of our progress so far this year against those 5 priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing and becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon. Our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run-rate expense savings by the end of 2020. Our clients are already beginning to see the results of our investments through faster and more consistent delivery of services, impacting our clients' operations and driving improved ranking within distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as Blockchain.
We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon-related annualized run rate savings of $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated it could be the case at our Investor Day, we did take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million in the first quarter related to Beacon.
Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth, given our leading positions in attractive markets. Although our first quarter fee revenues reflected challenging market environment experienced at the beginning of the year, I'm encouraged by the signs of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm. The first quarter included new asset servicing wins of approximately $264 billion, with approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter-end to be installed from current and prior periods.
I want to highlight a win that our global services group in Asia Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we were selected to be the master custodian for Australia's third largest superannuation fund, First State Super. This new relationship will also extend into global markets and our global exchange businesses. Of note, State Street now services 4 of the 7 largest super funds in what is the high-growth sector for us in Australia. I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business had met inflows of $13 billion, with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter, providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. Net activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows into EPS and $11 billion of inflows into cash products.
Third,, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire GE Asset Management supports our strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly enhanced our position in the outsourced CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business. Additionally, GE Asset Management expands SSgA's alternative capabilities while enhancing our active equity and fixed income teams, which broaden the solution sets we can provide to our combined client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high quality organization with strong cultural alignment with SSgA. And this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing and strong long-term relationship with GE. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meaning strategic or financial expectations. We made the decision during the quarter to exit our futures clearing business. At the beginning of the second quarter, we completed the sale of the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return-on-capital actions are [indiscernible] improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term.
Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSgA. Our SSgA -- our SPDR ETF business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter, including the SSgA Gender Diversity ETF. SHE is the first self indexed ETF, and its development was inspired by CalSTRS' efforts to move the needle on gender diversity in corporate America and seeks to track performance of the SSgA gender-diversity index, which comprises large -- U.S. large-cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on their Boards of Directors and in their senior leadership.
Fourth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflect our commitment to manage expenses, with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago, and also fat -- flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture, encouraging employees to embrace an owner's mindset and identify ways we can reduce cost across the enterprise, looking at everything from travel to consultant spend.
As I noted earlier, State Street Beacon is contributing to our expense management efforts, and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pre-tax net run-rate expense savings this year from the program.
And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Our two -- our first quarter '16 common stock dividend was $0.34 per share, and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q '16.
As I just reviewed for you, we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective of generating positive fee-basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve and FDIC released a review of our July 2015 RRP submission. Both the Federal Reserve and FDIC know that we have made improvements over our prior plans but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we're committed to addressing the issues in advancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve. We've had ongoing communications with the regulator and are focused on addressing all the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1, 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the first quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions."

Good morning, everyone.
This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included pretax restructuring cost of $97 million related to State Street Beacon, including the exit of our futures clearing business.
Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q '16. 1Q '16 results reflect softness in our fee revenue, primarily driven by lower global equity markets, partially offset by strong expense control.
Operating basis EPS for 1Q '16 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q '15 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q '15. Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.
Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year-ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonable -- seasonal retirement-eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q '15. Regarding capital in 1Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock.
Moving now to Slide 9. 1Q '16 fee revenue decreased 3.6%, while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q '15 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss National Bank actions at the time contributed to the decrease of fee revenue relative to the year-ago quarter.
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 22%, while the equity index was down approximately 12%.
Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, reflecting global equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign-exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q '15 due to lower volatility and volumes. Nevertheless, it increased relative to 4Q '15.
Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. The increase over both periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending.
Compared to 4Q '15, processing and other revenue decreased, reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax-advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis 1Q '16 net interest revenue benefited from the higher Fed funds rate and disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from the year ago, primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q '16 and were approximately flat relative to 1Q '15, a notable accomplishment.
Compensation and employee benefits were impacted by the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. Demonstrating solid expense control, the other expense category decreased significantly as compared to both 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. Compared to 4Q '15, lower other expenses were driven by lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Now turning to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remains strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the Basel III fully phased-in advanced approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach. Importantly, the March 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank increased to 6.2%, primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital.
We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 1Q '16 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q '16. This will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q '16 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchase amount is, therefore, consistent with the capital plan.
Moving onto the next slide, let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE Asset Management. While it remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to higher growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 million subject to adjustments, with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first 12-month period following the close of the transaction, and we're targeting a client asset retention rate of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition will significantly enhance State Street's position in the fast-growing outsourced chief investment officer market.
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March. On the expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expense growth of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note, my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run-rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016.
Now as a reminder, upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect the growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments.
In addition, we continue to have 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue, largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly, market rates to trend higher from March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including the review by the Federal Reserve Board.
In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q '16 results, we're encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March, and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and providing solutions to our clients.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Jay."

First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating-rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we have here in the U.S. that includes floating-rate securities in the securities portfolio, about half of the floating-rate securities are in U.S. dollars, so that's approximately $18 billion. And then we also -- our loans tend to be also a floating-rate asset. So basically, the floating-rate assets in our balance sheet increased as you would expect, based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates. In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo, and we also saw increased netting of -- for repo. So those 2 things combined increased what you see on the average rates earned and paid page that increased significantly the average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category. And then in the other interest earning asset line that you specifically asked about, that's our Enhanced Custody asset, and basically, that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher."

Good morning. The couple of things that we expect in the static rate scenario, Ken, the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under the static scenario would be, number one, the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is floating rate. About half of that is in the U.S. that benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside the U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rate on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher than the new fixed-rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative. And as we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only are the short-term interest rates negative with the ECB but in addition to that, because of the quantitative ECB program over there, spreads are really teeny as well. So the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in the static rate scenario, we would expect those to be the big drivers of the lower NIR in the next several quarters. If instead, through, we get a couple more dead fund hikes, we wouldn't expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in the first quarter, but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful as we get a higher rate on the floating-rate assets that I mentioned in response to Ashley's question."

We are really pleased with that. And as we talked about at the Investor Day, we continue to look at really every single area of expenses, and I think, we did a particularly good job in Q1 at reducing the outside consulting expenses, some of it regulatory, some of it not regulatory. We reduced travel expenses significantly in Q1. But there -- I do expect that there'll be a march up in regulatory expenses in Q2, Q3, Q4 as a result of dealing with the higher expectations. Now having said that, we'll continue to look at every area of expense, as Jay talked about. Project Beacon continues to be on track for the expected $100 million of savings for the full year. But again, between the regulatory cost and the net new business that we expect to be coming on board that will need expense to service, we thought it made sense to stick with the up to -- or to say, up to 2% on expense growth. And obviously, a lot of where we'll end up will also relate to where the fee revenue ends up as well."

Now you've seen not just this quarter but progressive quarters, good performance, outperformance in securities lending, and you're right, this quarter was a combination of agency and Enhanced Custody. But I would say, over a longer cycle, it's really been Enhanced Custody that's driven the disproportionate growth, and we expect that will continue. The -- there continues to be high demand in our, not only hedged, but in our traditional client base to use Enhanced Custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit. And we don't see much limitation. I'd say, most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter is existing clients doing more credit extension with us. So we've built out the product. I think I mentioned last quarter, we're building it out in Europe and Asia as we would do normally for all of our products. The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive proposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we see continued demand. We don't see much in a way of capacity constraints. And we think we've figured out how to make this attractive from a return on capital standpoint."

But they've also been successful on attracting some other big names in the outsourced CIO market place. So I think that if you just look at that segment of the market, particularly against an environment where rates are likely to be low for a protracted period of time, we think that's a growth market. And we think by kind of unshackling GE from GE and making it part of State Street, that will be a more attractive provider of services in the outsourced CIO market. So they've had some growth on their own, we've also had some growth. By combining it, we think we go at a faster rate. So that's -- part of -- that's core to the growth opportunity. But also core to the growth opportunities, you've heard us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions, and whether it's a target-date fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we had a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes, particularly alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all 3, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth. So it's really taking up, I'd say, a very high-quality and stable asset management organization, embedding it at State Street and 2 synergies on the revenue side and the OCIO and solutions segments of the market."

The -- Blockchain has received appropriately a lot of attention, and I think it's, to me, it's synonymous with digitization, generally. I think if I would have put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and Blockchain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the 4 walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized, and that's going to require standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I see Blockchain being most relevant. We have internally, within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's 4 maybe 5 pilots going on, to use Blockchain SMEs to digitize within State Street linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example and maybe the most easily explained example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market, and processing a bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing where we're using Blockchain. And we've got agreement from all of the counter-parties to participate in a Blockchain pilot around bank loan processing. So what that would do is take an activity where there's process improvements and technology that do we need to do internally within State Street, but it would extend it to other counter-parties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we'll digitize our own environment, but it will require standards across the industry and again, Blockchain may be one of those. We're participating in a group called R3. I think there's up to 16 banking institutions that are trying to figure out what the application -- what the best applications are to use Blockchain in order to create standards intercompany, interindustry. And so, I think it's -- we're going to absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the home run here is, if we can get some standards developed around how we will inter-operate from a digital standpoint. And I think Blockchain could be, if it's not Blockchain, it will be something else, one of those standards that emerge that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. Is that -- I don't know if that confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We can control, we control. That's what we're doing with Beacon. But in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize Blockchain [indiscernible]."

So the SHE Index that we -- that I described in my prepared comments is using a -- is developing a strategy in developed -- in this case, this is the first time we have self-indexed. So we built the index, back tested it and then packaged it in an ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening. In fact, we're not the only ones doing that, I think. In the broad beta and ETF space, that's a theme. The other thing I would say is that I'd point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine, where -- they're taking active fixed-income strategies. They're the manager, we're packaging it in the ETF and distributing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional product spaces. And I come a little short because I'm not quite sold yet that you'll take active equity product, for instance, in wrap it in an ETF. But others would take the other side of that argument. So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to be wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions in the retail market space. So we have -- I would say, that SSgA has deployed kind of an open platform strategy, where if we can create the index in the case of SHE, manufacture and distribute, and we will, but if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSgA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing, which we've done, not just with DoubleLine, but with Nuveen, MFS and several other firms.

From what I could see, your asset management business, if I look at the operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13%, and if I look at full year asset management, margin was 19 and change. 13% for the fourth quarter and 19 and change, it's a really low margin compared to peers. Can you talk a little bit about specifically that business, what you can do to [indiscernible] in moving [indiscernible], things like EPS, what you can do to accelerate the operating margin improvement and why so far behind peers?"

And I think that if you look over an extended period of time, you would've seen we've hit a trough with regard to returns, and I feel like the investments that we've been making are starting to create some traction. And I look at ETFs and really, solutions as being cornerstone of that. In addition to some of the positioning we have in markets outside the U.S., again, I would look to those same two cornerstone elements. So we're working on it, we think we're making the right investments. I think, focus is important. SSgA, in some respects, does not have a lot of truer comps, given what it does, and we're trying to be very good at a couple of things and do them well globally, and I think we're on the right track."

Now, let me turn it over to Jay."
188785,330371054,965071,"State Street Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone.Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to",1167,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone.
Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we made during the quarter on the 5 strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in a new environment and deliver value on the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are: one, to become a digital leader in financial services; to drive growth from our core franchise; to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation; increase our focus on expense management; and leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders.
As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined for you highlights of our progress so far this year against those 5 priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing and becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon. Our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run-rate expense savings by the end of 2020. Our clients are already beginning to see the results of our investments through faster and more consistent delivery of services, impacting our clients' operations and driving improved ranking within distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as Blockchain.
We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon-related annualized run rate savings of $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated it could be the case at our Investor Day, we did take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million in the first quarter related to Beacon.
Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth, given our leading positions in attractive markets. Although our first quarter fee revenues reflected challenging market environment experienced at the beginning of the year, I'm encouraged by the signs of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm. The first quarter included new asset servicing wins of approximately $264 billion, with approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter-end to be installed from current and prior periods.
I want to highlight a win that our global services group in Asia Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we were selected to be the master custodian for Australia's third largest superannuation fund, First State Super. This new relationship will also extend into global markets and our global exchange businesses. Of note, State Street now services 4 of the 7 largest super funds in what is the high-growth sector for us in Australia. I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business had net inflows of $13 billion, with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter, providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. Net activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows into EPS and $11 billion of inflows into cash products.
Third,, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire GE Asset Management supports our strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly enhanced our position in the outsourced CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business. Additionally, GE Asset Management expands SSgA's alternative capabilities while enhancing our active equity and fixed income teams, which broaden the solution sets we can provide to our combined client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high quality organization with strong cultural alignment with SSgA. And this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing and strong long-term relationship with GE. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meaning strategic or financial expectations. We made the decision during the quarter to exit our futures clearing business. At the beginning of the second quarter, we completed the sale of the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return-on-capital actions are [indiscernible] improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term.
Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSgA. Our SSgA -- our SPDR ETF business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter, including the SSgA Gender Diversity ETF. SHE is the first self indexed ETF, and its development was inspired by CalSTRS' efforts to move the needle on gender diversity in corporate America and seeks to track performance of the SSgA gender-diversity index, which comprises large -- U.S. large-cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on their Boards of Directors and in their senior leadership.
Fourth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflect our commitment to manage expenses, with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago, and also fat -- flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture, encouraging employees to embrace an owner's mindset and identify ways we can reduce cost across the enterprise, looking at everything from travel to consultant spend.
As I noted earlier, State Street Beacon is contributing to our expense management efforts, and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pre-tax net run-rate expense savings this year from the program.
And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Our two -- our first quarter '16 common stock dividend was $0.34 per share, and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q '16.
As I just reviewed for you, we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective of generating positive fee-basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve and FDIC released their review of our July 2015 RRP submission. Both the Federal Reserve and FDIC know that we have made improvements over our prior plans but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we're committed to addressing the issues in advancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve. We've had ongoing communications with the regulator and are focused on addressing all the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1, 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the first quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions."
188785,330371054,965071,"State Street Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay.

Good morning, everyone.
This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included pretax restructuring cost of $97 million related to State Street Beacon, including the exit of our futures clearing business.
Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q '16. 1Q '16 results reflect softness in our fee revenue, primarily driven by lower global equity markets, partially offset by strong expense control.
Operating basis EPS for 1Q '16 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q '15 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q '15. Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.
Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year-ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonable -- seasonal retirement-eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q '15. Regarding capital in 1Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock.
Moving now to Slide 9. 1Q '16 fee revenue decreased 3.6%, while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q '15 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss National Bank actions at the time contributed to the decrease of fee revenue relative to the year-ago quarter.
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley emerging market index decreased 22%, while the equity index was down approximately 12%.
Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, reflecting global equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign-exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q '15 due to lower volatility and volumes. Nevertheless, it increased relative to 4Q '15.
Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. The increase over both periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending.
Compared to 4Q '15, processing and other revenue decreased, reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax-advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis 1Q '16 net interest revenue benefited from the higher Fed funds rate and disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from the year ago, primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q '16 and were approximately flat relative to 1Q '15, a notable accomplishment.
Compensation and employee benefits were impacted by the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. Demonstrating solid expense control, the other expense category decreased significantly as compared to both 1Q '15 and 4Q '15. Compared to 4Q '15, lower other expenses were driven by lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Now turning to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remains strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the Basel III fully phased-in advanced approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach. Importantly, the March 31 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank increased to 6.2%, primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital.
We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 1Q '16 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q '16. This will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q '16 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchase amount is, therefore, consistent with the capital plan.
Moving onto the next slide, let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE Asset Management. While it remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to higher growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 million subject to adjustments, with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first 12-month period following the close of the transaction, and we're targeting a client asset retention rate of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition will significantly enhance State Street's position in the fast-growing outsourced chief investment officer market.
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March. On the expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expense growth of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note, my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run-rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016.
Now as a reminder, upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect the growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments.
In addition, we continue to have 2 scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue, largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly, market rates to trend higher from March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process, including the review by the Federal Reserve Board.
In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q '16 results, we're encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March, and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and providing solutions to our clients.

I would point to a couple of things, and I wouldn't characterize it, Ashley, as just the impact on the other asset bucket, but there were a couple of things that broadly helped us. First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating-rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we have here in the U.S. that includes floating-rate securities in the securities portfolio, about half of the floating-rate securities are in U.S. dollars, so that's approximately $18 billion. And then we also -- our loans tend to be also a floating-rate asset. So basically, the floating-rate assets in our balance sheet increased as you would expect, based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates. In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo, and we also saw increased netting of -- for repo. So those 2 things combined increased what you see on the average rates earned and paid page that increased significantly the average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category. And then in the other interest earning asset line that you specifically asked about, that's our Enhanced Custody asset, and basically, that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher."

So can you just kind of help us just walk through how much of that first quarter goes away? And then the other typical pushes and pulls in terms of any lingering yield compression versus balance sheet shrinkage we should be thinking about."

Good morning. The couple of things that we expect in the static rate scenario, Ken, the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under the static scenario would be, number one, the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is floating rate. About half of that is in the U.S. that benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside the U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rate on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher than the new fixed-rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative. And as we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only are the short-term interest rates negative with the ECB but in addition to that, because of the quantitative ECB program over there, spreads are really teeny as well. So the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in the static rate scenario, we would expect those to be the big drivers of the lower NIR in the next several quarters. If instead, through, we get a couple more dead fund hikes, we wouldn't expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in the first quarter, but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful as we get a higher rate on the floating-rate assets that I mentioned in response to Ashley's question."

Now having said that, we'll continue to look at every area of expense, as Jay talked about. Project Beacon continues to be on track for the expected $100 million of savings for the full year.

The -- there continues to be high demand in our, not only hedged, but in our traditional client base to use Enhanced Custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit. And we don't see much limitation. I'd say, most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter is existing clients doing more credit extension with us. So we've built out the product. I think I mentioned last quarter, we're building it out in Europe and Asia as we would do normally for all of our products. The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive proposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we see continued demand.

And we think by kind of unshackling GE from GE and making it part of State Street, that will be a more attractive provider of services in the outsourced CIO market. So they've had some growth on their own, we've also had some growth. By combining it, we think we grow at a faster rate. So that's -- part of -- that's core to the growth opportunity. But also core to the growth opportunities, you've heard us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions, and whether it's a target-date fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we had a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes, particularly alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all 3, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth. So it's really taking up, I'd say, a very high-quality and stable asset management organization, embedding it at State Street and 2 synergies on the revenue side and the OCIO and solutions segments of the market."

The -- Blockchain has received appropriately a lot of attention, and I think it's, to me, it's synonymous with digitization, generally. I think if I would have put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and Blockchain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the 4 walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized, and that's going to require standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I see Blockchain being most relevant. We have internally, within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's 4 maybe 5 pilots going on, to use Blockchain SMEs to digitize within State Street linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example and maybe the most easily explained example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market, and processing a bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing where we're using Blockchain. And we've got agreement from all of the counter-parties to participate in a Blockchain pilot around bank loan processing. So what that would do is take an activity where there's process improvements and technology that do we need to do internally within State Street, but it would extend it to other counter-parties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we'll digitize our own environment, but it will require standards across the industry and again, Blockchain may be one of those. We're participating in a group called R3. I think there's up to 16 banking institutions that are trying to figure out what the application -- what the best applications are to use Blockchain in order to create standards intercompany, interindustry. And so, I think it's -- we're going to absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the home run here is, if we can get some standards developed around how we will inter-operate from a digital standpoint. And I think Blockchain could be, if it's not Blockchain, it will be something else, one of those standards that emerge that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. Is that -- I don't know if that confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We can control, we control. That's what we're doing with Beacon. But in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize Blockchain [indiscernible]."

So the SHE Index that we -- that I described in my prepared comments is using a -- is developing a strategy in developed -- in this case, this is the first time we have self-indexed. So we built the index, back tested it and then packaged it in an ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening. In fact, we're not the only ones doing that, I think. In the broad beta and ETF space, that's a theme. The other thing I would say is that I'd point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine, where -- they're taking active fixed-income strategies. They're the manager, we're packaging it in the ETF and distributing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional product spaces. And I come a little short because I'm not quite sold yet that you'll take active equity product, for instance, and wrap it in an ETF. But others would take the other side of that argument. So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to be wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions in the retail market space. So we have -- I would say, that SSgA has deployed kind of an open platform strategy, where if we can create the index in the case of SHE, manufacture and distribute, and we will, but if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSgA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing, which we've done, not just with DoubleLine, but with Nuveen, MFS and several other firms. Hopefully that helps."

So we've been running more, probably 60-40 U.S., non-U.S. For this quarter, it was more 70-30, 30% being U.S., 70% non-U.S. So good progress in Asia Pacific really anchored in not only Australia, which I highlighted, but that we've also seen some movement in Japan, where we've seen the first outsourcing of investment trust funds, something we've been pursuing for a long time. So that's the first question. The second, pipelines are quite full. I think that -- I've said this before, but if you look at the asset owner and maybe and more specifically, the asset management segment between difficulty in achieving above benchmark returns to increasing regulatory pressure, we've never seen the demand for things like middle office outsourcing that we have on our plate right now. And importantly, in that particular product, there's a willingness to accept standardized services. So I feel very good about the pipeline, not only from a geographic standpoint, but across -- in particular asset managers but asset service -- asset owners as well."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflects strong fee growth compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remains strong across our global client base as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multi-year digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies, as well as new product innovations for our clients. 
As you may have seen in the new today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements subject to final approval that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources. So where possible and appropriate, we feel it is in our clients interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to Slide 5 of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantial progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services, we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016, we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enables straight through processing of plant transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here includes faster cycle times with the end of day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier and reduction of manual transactions. 
Our fund administration digitization prototype is underway and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of [indiscernible] Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management company's Japanese investment trust business. 
Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. 
We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business, driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of our official institution clients, redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly, these outsource are primarily on a low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our high-yielding product lines, such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter, we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016, and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. 
We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy, and earlier this month on July 1, we successfully completed our acquisition in GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher growth return businesses. It's also an important part of SSJ's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities, including active management, alternative and outsourced Chief Investment Officer capabilities. 
With our focus on expense management, we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in yet annualized pretax expense savings in 2016. 
We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the fed reserves 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share starting in the third quarter of 2016, subject to Board of Directors approval. 
We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. 
Moving to Slide #6. I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the U.K. represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management and is expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates, while low interest rates are driving a surge for yield at pushes funds out of deposits into other investments, such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. 
In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing that are the regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. 
We have a deep and diversified presence in the Europe as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the U.K., with the majority being situated in 9 European countries under our recently consolidated International Bank, which is based in Germany. Given this presence, we have an organizational structure that give us a potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. 
We're well positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We have the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last 3 few years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, with an industry leader in ETF servicing, with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. 
Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short and long-term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post that EU referendum vote. We believe the post-EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strengthened offshore in the U.K. and in pan-European fund structures in an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well positioned to in these areas to take advantage of the short and long-term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the second quarter, and then we'll turn it to your questions. Mike?"

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. First, on April 1, 2016,, we sold the WM Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters, resulting on a pretax gain of approximately $53 million. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoiced clients for certain expenses. 
I will refer to Slide 7 in the slide presentation for discussion of operating basis results for 2Q '16 and for the 6-month ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 
By way of summary, 2Q '16 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q '16 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q '15 and increased from 1Q '16, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Year-to-date, EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a decrease in the year-to-date fee revenue, primarily due to lower equity markets, as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share purchases and lower expenses. Importantly, 2Q '16 total expenses decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pretax margin to 31.5% in 2Q '16. 
The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32%, primarily due to timing of our tax [indiscernible] investments. 
Regarding capital, in 2Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. 
Moving to Slide 9, I want to highlight of the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q '16 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q '16, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. 
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 2Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower equity markets and increased relative to 1Q '16 due to Net New Business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSEI emerging market index decreased 19%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. 
Foreign-exchange revenue, decrease from 2Q '15 due to lower volumes. Securities funds revenue was up slightly from 2Q '15, primarily reflecting continued growth in an Enhanced Custody, mostly offset by lower season benefit compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from the higher fed funds rate at the end of 4Q '15, as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '15, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 2Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 2Q '16, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q '15. 2Q '16 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q '16 when excluding the 1Q '16 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Compared to 2Q '15, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly, primarily due to increased cost to support regulatory initiatives and Net New Business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q '15 driven by a significant reduction in professional services cost. 
Let me now go to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remains strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully phased-in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corp increased to 6.1% and the bank increased to 6.3%, primarily due to the preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. 
Please note that the capital impact of the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimates of this impact is noted on Slide 16. 
We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q '16 under our prior common stock purchase program announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving on now to the next slide. Let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management support our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first full 12-month period as of July 1 2016. 
Moving to Slide 17, I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to targets positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 assuming current market conditions. 
Included in our expectation to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. 
Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon on multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pretax this savings in 2016. 
Moving on to net interest revenue for full year 2016, we currently expect operating basis in IR to modestly exceed the high-end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional Central Bank easing occurs outside the U.S. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q '16 results and sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue and strong expense control positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

Now that the Beacon effort, as you know, is designed to improve straight through processing, so cleanup a lot of hand dust and inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact that has on clients, that can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit, one of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day, produce a net asset value based on working of the day and the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally. And the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds down to your downstream distribution systems, it feeds the newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen you through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value of 20 to 30 minutes, which in an hour and a half window, it's a significant. So clients who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes earlier, it gets everybody to the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane, but to our clients, it's a huge win. I'd say, secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company, and again, that's just improves not only cost, but accuracy in how data flows back to our clients. I think to your question, ultimately, our vision or end game to this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon, but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it realtime to our clients, the ability to get information in for day, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this. And when we establish global exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit of digitizing our internal production environment and to provide information and analytics services to our clients, not just back-office, but middle and front-office as well. And in parallel, global exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So you heard me say before, to me it is the next big thing in this business, and we're making good progress."

And at this point, I anticipate that, that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously, it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move, at least in the near term, I would expect that it would move in lockstep with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring, but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that, overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year, but again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully."

I think, maybe start out broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016. And primarily, I would focus on 2 areas that we've talked about previously. The first is you accurately pointed out, we've done a good job in replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting spend with full-time employees. And that's a real good trade economically. And we also expect that, that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're really pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success today here around our Project Beacon. And as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around Project Beacon, specifically we move faster on management spins and layers than we had previously planned, we also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight through processing that's that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job and all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year, and they're pretty specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is we have known new business in the global servicing business, and we will obviously staff to service that new business, and that includes, for example, the

And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this will be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the preps that we issued in second quarter to essentially funded, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect to the contribution to pretax earnings, if we exclude of the merger and integration costs, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following 3 quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a call it a $240 million annualized number to Q3 to something in the $270 million to $300 million range for the first full 12 months."

First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So",298,"So I'll answer the number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So essentially, I mean, if you double that, you get to $150 million, and basically that syncs up with the point that I was making that we expect now the full year savings to be approximately $140 million for full year 2016 versus full year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in some, particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year as compared to the quarter 2 expense space. So from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses, and again, a little bit higher than that Beacon spending pushing it. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit the less than what you get if you double the year-to-date savings number. Again in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of '17. I think the main point is that we still expect those '17 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year '16.

And so what we've assumed in the updated NIR  forecast that we gave you is the static rate in the U.S. And then likely some easing by the Bank of England probably in August. And so it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio as the existing portfolio rules hovering in between lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the U.K. are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue. As it relates -- actually one of the data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did notes on Slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have, it was actually 4 the discrete securities prepay, it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and in Q4. So if you're really -- if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you sort of start with the $541 million rather than a $546 million, again just it will help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect, at this point, to have to issue additional long-term debt just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on that on a longer-term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed CLEC requirements. Now again [indiscernible] at this point, it's a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates to specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long-term debt just because of RRP.

So first point is that in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly asset equities in separate accounts, not DCFs, and I would say the other theme which I referenced is sovereign well funds, mostly oil-based funds looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields from a standpoint of the fees and, more particularly, the management fees. And we've had good success with that. I referenced some of that, the new ETFs we brought up, that's a continuation on the theme. I'd also add that GLD, the Gold fund, is probably more of a product for the times, but we've had great traction in our active front equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint. And therefore, the flows are coming in nicely. The products from our standpoint the multi-asset class. So I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months, to focus on those higher fee products. And I think we're making headway. So if you look at the first quarter, the management fees growth of almost 5%. Some of that is market, but some of that is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking to the rest of the year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business, mostly based on introducing higher-yielding products in getting positive flows into those products. I think, the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy cautiously is to move to the higher end of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is the GE Asset Management business is a really big add and that supporting that strategy. And not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsourced CIO marketplace given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products, that can be sold as a standalone, but even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions whether it's in a 401 phase setting, outsourced CIO or other [indiscernible] of the spectrum."

I think, my Brexit related comments, the only caveat that I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools, both pension, interest and investment asset pools. So if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple of years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up, savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France. And those products increasingly are not only growing, but the asset pools are moving, but the assets are moving out of the banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good generally. Enter Brexit, tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means and how the U.K. will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it will take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at through investment product, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one of the largest market, Europe you've got 20 different markets, and so the notion of passporting and creating products and 1 domicile in being able to sell it across the Eurozone is critical to success point for an asset manager in Europe. So it's likely, and there are some product structures like [indiscernible]  UCITS, for existence, for example, are created in the U.K., and their past portable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the U.K. and Eurozone results in folks having to transition [indiscernible] to things like [indiscernible], then we ought to do that. We're the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think, the big winners will be the offshore centers, Luxembourg and probably more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners to the last couple of years with regards to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit as to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business, some, years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the [indiscernible] São Paulo, it give us a leading presence in Italy, we've always been U.K. we've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products with the most geographies covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of [indiscernible] Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of providers that can provide pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we're at the top of that pyramid, some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive as servicing capability as we do in Europe, hence, the enthusiasm."

Now we invested in there, but the point is it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so, yes, I do believe that Project Beacon has already shown it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success as we talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point to that has helped us. Now, it doesn't mean that there isn't upward pressure on regulatory expense particularly around RRP, but have I do think that we've shown that we're executing on the plan that we have previously communicated, which is to make that shift, which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that are marked market sensitivity under the severely adverse scenario is quite a bit better than what have done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rule. So, yes, I feel good about all of that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. Maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the way outside of the U.S., it still been moving at the negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet get the inflection point. But I'd like to believe that, at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later."

I think, you started at with the cloud then Beacon, that's critically important from a standpoint of managing costs in a difficult environment. But even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services, vis-à-vis the competitors in the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in the low return environment outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition back until I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So whether it's a mutual fund manager of moving to outsourced middle-office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate as a search to outsource those things. So we think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment in our client base based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's the trend there that we're likely to continue to see in the cloud and Beacon as right at the center of that. Because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insights from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients. Again, it's both of those things to happen. I think, similarly and the world of asset management, we have been on the journey the last couple of years to transition. I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have, but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think, the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes. And GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so I would say it's ETF, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace. But this notional solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the Asset Management world, and I think, we're well positioned in the GE transaction just put us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through period here where we're getting our cost that are aligned for the reality for today, we're moving digitally, which is where the future is going to be with regard to the clients needs, and I'd say Asset Management is going through a similar transition."

First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits,  a. Greater phase than the cuts, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item, in particular, Q2 versus Q1, that the greater amount that we're charging for European deposits, in particular. Second though, it's a little bit of a funny nuance, we do have an any given quarter decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits in the U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed, or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was the FX swap cost that we normally run through that line, that was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side. So now net impact to the NIM. And in fact, you can see the decline in the interest-bearing deposits banks line item, that is essentially the partially offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on, is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S."

So I'd say at least near term, there's more near term downward pressure on NIM.

First, as I mentioned, a couple of times, we did have 4 specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category. Pre-pay in the second quarter, and the results of those 4 discrete securities prepaying in total was a onetime boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS numbers. So if you do that, the 143 yield for ABS that you see in the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the $132 million from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors or the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits for the euro deposits, in particular. Going the other way though was, in fact, the impact of the continued grind where the maturing fixed-rate assets tend to mature the rate lower than the new fixed-rate investments. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously. But I'd first washout the $5 million. And those 2 points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter."

And whether it's #1 in ETFs, where we have close to 70% share, or U.S. mutual funds, which I referenced the offshore domiciles of the Luxembourg and Dublin on and on. The other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows. And over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher-yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs, you've seen a retrenchment generally from emerging markets, which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So I would say the effective markets flows and the new business that the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding, and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, obviously, the market. So I would say, we think, long-term that we're best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods, quarters and years. But for us, it's making sure that we continue to position against of the most attractive clients in this segment and the most attractive segments, and making sure that, consistent with the Investor Day that we're keeping our expenses in line so that you can maintain our margin and as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I referenced then, we would assume that, that would flow to the bottom line.

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflects strong fee growth compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remained strong across our global client base, as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multiyear digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients. 
As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements, subject to final approval, that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources. So where possible and appropriate, we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to Slide 5 of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantial progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. 
In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services, we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016, we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight-through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier, and reduction of manual transactions. Our fund administration digitization prototype is under way and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. 
Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of -- by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.'s Japanese investment trust business. 
Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. 
We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business, driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly, these outflows are primarily on our low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our high-yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter, we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflective -- reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016, and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. 
We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy. And earlier this month, on July 1, we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher-growth and return businesses. It's also an important part of SSgA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities, including active management, alternative and outsourced chief investment officer capabilities. 
With our focus on expense management, we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pretax expense savings in 2016. 
We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Fed Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our common -- quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share starting in the third quarter of 2016, subject to Board of Directors approval. 
We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. 
Moving to Slide #6. I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. 
Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the U.K. represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management, and it's expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates, while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. 
In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing that are -- are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. 
We have a deep and diversified presence in the Europe as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the U.K. with the majority being situated in 9 European countries under our recently consolidated international bank, which is based in Germany. Given this presence, we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. 
We're well positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last 3 years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. 
Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short- and long-term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post-EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the U.K. and in pan-European fund structures and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short- and long-term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?"

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/R",1242,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. 
First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $53 million. 
Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses. 
I'll refer to Slide 7 in the slide presentation for a discussion of operating basis results for 2Q '16 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 
By way of summary, 2Q '16 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q '16 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q '15 and increased from 1Q '16, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Year-to-date, EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets, as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. 
Importantly, 2Q '16 total expenses decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pretax margin to 31.5% in 2Q '16. 
The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax-advantaged investments. 
Regarding capital, in 2Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. 
Moving to Slide 9. I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q '16 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q '16, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. 
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 2Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q '16 due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q '15 due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q '15, primarily reflecting continued growth in an Enhanced Custody, mostly offset by lower seasonal benefit compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher  rate at the end of 4Q '15 as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '15, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 2Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well controlled in 2Q '16, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q '15. 2Q '16 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q '16 when excluding the 1Q '16 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Compared to 2Q '15, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly primarily due to increased cost to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q '15, driven by a significant reduction in professional services costs. 
Let me now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully phased-in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corp increased to 6.1% and the bank increased to 6.3% primarily due to preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. 
Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on Slide 16. 
We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q '16 under our prior common stock purchase program announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving on now to the next slide. Let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher-growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the full -- for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016. 
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. 
Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions. Included in our expectation to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. 
Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. 
Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pretax fiscal savings in 2016. 
Moving on to net interest revenue for full year 2016. We currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q '16 results and sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue. And strong expense control positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

The Beacon effort, as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so cleanup a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit, one of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day, produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally. And production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds the newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 to 30 minutes, which, in a 1.5-hour window, is significant. So clients who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early, it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane, but to our clients, it's a huge win. I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy in how data flows back to our clients. I think your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon, but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this. And when we established global exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit of digitizing our internal production environment and to provide information and analytics services to our clients not just back office but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So you've heard me say before to me it is the next big thing in this business, and we're making good progress."

And at this point, I anticipate that, that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously, it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move -- at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lockstep with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring, but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully."

I think maybe start out broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016. And primarily, I would focus on 2 areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting spend with full-time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that, that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success today here around Project Beacon.  And as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around Project Beacon. Specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year. And there are 3 pretty specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is we're -- we have known new business in the global servicing business, and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes, for example, the

So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this.

And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the preps that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pretax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration costs, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the -- less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following 3 quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it, a $240 million annualized number in Q3 to something in the $270 million to $300 million range in -- for the first full 12 months."

First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 mil",300,"So I would say there are a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So essentially, I mean, if you double that, you get to $150 million, and basically that syncs up with the point that I was making that we expect now the full year savings to be approximately $140 million for full year 2016 versus full year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in some, particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year as compared to the quarter 2 expense space. So from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses, and again, a little bit higher than that Beacon spending pushing that so the savings number for the full year being a little bit the less than what you get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number. Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of '17. I think the main point is that we still expect the '17 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year '16. So it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target or to change the end date. But again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future."

As it relates -- actually one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on Slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have, it was actually 4 discrete securities prepay, so it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and in Q4. So if you're really -- if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million, again, just -- it'll help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect, at this point, to have to issue additional long-term debt, just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer-term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now again TLAC at this point is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long-term debt just because of RRP. But, again, it's, the whole RRP situation's a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine."

Let me pick that one up. The -- so first point is that in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly asset equities in separate accounts, so not ETFs, and I would say the other theme which I referenced is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based, sovereign wealth funds looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them, from a standpoint of the fees, and more particularly, the management fees. And we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the Gold Fund, is probably more of a product for the times, but we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely. High-fee products from our standpoint, the multi-asset class. And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months, to focus on those higher fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter, and the management fee growth of almost 5%. Some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking to the rest of the year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business, mostly based on introducing higher-yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF, hence by the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher ends of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add, in that, supporting that strategy. And it -- not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsource CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products, that can be sold as stand-alone, but even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO or other elements of the risk spectrum."

But if",543,"Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. The -- I think it's -- my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools, both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple of years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up, savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France. And those products increasingly are not only growing, but the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good, generally. Enter Brexit, tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means, and how the U.K. will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it'll take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogenous market, Europe you've got 20 different markets, and so the notion of passporting or creating product in 1 domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures like [indiscernible], SICAV, UCITS. [indiscernible] for existence -- for example, are created in the U.K., and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the U.K. and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition [indiscernible] to things like SICAVs, then where they ought to do that. We are the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think, the big winners will be the offshore centers, Luxembourg and probably more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple of years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, the -- when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business, some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaulo deal give us a leading presence in Italy, we've always been in the U.K., we've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products with the most geography covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we're at the top of that pyramid, some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe, Hence, the enthusiasm."

First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, Project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so, yes, I do believe that Project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success as we talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us. Now, it doesn't mean that there is an upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around the RRP, but the -- I do think that we've shown that we're executing on the plan that we had previously communicated, which is to make that shift, which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity, under the severely adverse scenario, is quite a bit better than what had been done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rule. So yes, I feel good about all that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the -- way outside of the U.S., it's still been moving at a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point. But I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later."

I think, you started out with the cloud, then Beacon, and that's critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment. But even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services vis-à-vis the competitors in the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket, too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So whether it's a mutual fund manager of moving to outsourced middle-office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base, based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see in the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that. Because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients. Again, it's forcing both of those things to happen. I think, similarly, in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years to transition. I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have, but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think, the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes. And GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace. But this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the Asset Management world, and I think, we're well positioned, and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our cost better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally, which is where the future is going to be with regard to the client's needs, and I'd say Asset Management is going through a similar transition."

Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter: First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits, at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item, in particular, Q2 versus Q1, that the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular; Second though, it's a little bit of a funny nuance, we do have, in any given quarter, decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed, or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap cost that we normally run through that line, that was a, it was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side. So no net impact to the NIM. And in fact, you can see the decline in the interest-bearing deposits with banks line item, that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S."

And that would probably reduce them further on their own, without explosive action. But it's something, obviously, we monitor very carefully.

First, as I mentioned a couple of times, we did have 4 specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category. Pre-pay in the second quarter, and the result of those 4 discrete securities prepaying in total was a onetime boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS numbers. So if you do that, the 143 yield for ABS that you see in the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the $132 million from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline, and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in -- for the euro deposits, in particular. Going the other way though was, in fact, the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed-rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed-rate investments. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously. But I'd first washout the $5 million. And then, those -- the 2 points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter."

What -- the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows. And over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher-yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs, you've seen a retrenchment, generally from emerging markets, which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So I would say the effective markets flows and new business that the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding, and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously, the market. So I would say, we think, long-term that we're best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us, it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in this segment and the most attractive segments, and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day that we are keeping our expenses in line so that we can maintain our margin and as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I reference then, we would assume that, that would flow to the bottom line.

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflects strong fee growth compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remained strong across our global client base, as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multiyear digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients. 
As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements, subject to final approval, that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources. So where possible and appropriate, we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to Slide 5 of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. 
In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services, we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016, we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight-through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier, and reduction of manual transactions. Our fund administration digitization prototype is under way and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. 
Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of -- by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.'s Japanese investment trust business. 
Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. 
We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business, driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly, these outflows are primarily on our low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our high-yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter, we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflective -- reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016, and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. 
We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy. And earlier this month, on July 1, we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher-growth and return businesses. It's also an important part of SSgA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities, including active management, alternative and outsourced chief investment officer capabilities. 
With our focus on expense management, we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pretax expense savings in 2016. 
We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Fed Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our common -- quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share starting in the third quarter of 2016, subject to Board of Directors approval. 
We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. 
Moving to Slide #6. I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. 
Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the U.K. represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management, and it's expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates, while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. 
In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing that are -- are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. 
We have a deep and diversified presence in the Europe as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the U.K. with the majority being situated in 9 European countries under our recently consolidated international bank, which is based in Germany. Given this presence, we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. 
We're well positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last 3 years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. 
Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short- and long-term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post-EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the U.K. and in pan-European fund structures and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short- and long-term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?"
188785,365727473,1014006,"State Street Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/R",1243,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. 
First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $53 million. 
Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses. 
Now refer to Slide 7 in the slide presentation for a discussion of operating basis results for 2Q '16 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 
By way of summary, 2Q '16 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q '16 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q '15 and increased from 1Q '16, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Year-to-date, EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets, as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. 
Importantly, 2Q '16 total expenses decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pretax margin to 31.5% in 2Q '16. 
The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax-advantaged investments. 
Regarding capital, in 2Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. 
Moving to Slide 9. I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q '16 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q '16, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. 
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 2Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q '16 due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q '15 due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q '15, primarily reflecting continued growth in an Enhanced Custody, mostly offset by lower seasonal benefit compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher fed funds rate at the end of 4Q '15 as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '15, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 2Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well controlled in 2Q '16, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q '15. 2Q '16 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q '16 when excluding the 1Q '16 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Compared to 2Q '15, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly primarily due to increased cost to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q '15, driven by a significant reduction in professional services costs. 
We now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully phased-in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corp increased to 6.1% and the bank increased to 6.3% primarily due to preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. 
Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on Slide 16. 
We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q '16 under our prior common stock purchase program announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving on now to the next slide. Let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher-growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the full -- for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016. 
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. 
Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions. Included in our expectation to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. 
Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. 
Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pretax fiscal savings in 2016. 
Moving on to net interest revenue for full year 2016. We currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q '16 results and sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue. And strong expense control, positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jay."

The Beacon effort, as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so cleanup a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit, one of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day, produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally. And the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds the newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 to 30 minutes, which, in a 1.5-hour window, is significant. So clients who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early, it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane, but to our clients, it's a huge win. I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy in how data flows back to our clients. I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon, but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this. And when we established global exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit of digitizing our internal production environment or to provide information and analytics services to our clients not just back office but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So you've heard me say before to me it is the next big thing in this business, and we're making good progress."

And at this point, I anticipate that, that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously, it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move -- at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lockstep with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring, but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully."

I think maybe start out broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016. And primarily, I would focus on 2 areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full-time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that, that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to date here around Project Beacon.  And as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around Project Beacon. Specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year. And there are 3 pretty specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is we're -- we have known new business in the global servicing business, and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes, for example, the

So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this.

And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the preps that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pretax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration costs, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the -- less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following 3 quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it, a $240 million annualized number in Q3 to something in the $270 million to $300 million range in -- for the first full 12 months."

First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 mil",298,"So I would say there are a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So essentially, I mean, if you double that, you get to $150 million, and basically that syncs up with the point that I was making that we expect now the full year savings to be approximately $140 million for full year 2016 versus full year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in some, particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year as compared to the quarter 2 expense space. So from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses, and again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number. Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of '17. I think the main point is that we still expect the '17 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year '16. So it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target or to change the end date. But again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future."

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155.

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155. And so the, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S. and then likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the U.K. is -- are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue. As it relates -- actually one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on Slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have, it was actually 4 discrete securities prepay, so it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and in Q4. So if you're really -- if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million, again, just -- it'll help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect, at this point, to have to issue additional long-term debt, just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer-term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now again TLAC at this point is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long-term debt just because of RRP. But, again, it's, the whole RRP situation's a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine."

Let me pick that one up. The -- so first point is that in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities in separate accounts, so not ETFs, and I would say the other theme which I referenced is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based, sovereign wealth funds looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them, from a standpoint of the fees, and more particularly, the management fees. And we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the Gold Fund, is probably more of a product for the times, but we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely. High-fee products from our standpoint, the multi-asset class. And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months, to focus on those higher fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter, and the management fee growth of almost 5%. Some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of the year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business, mostly based on introducing higher-yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher ends of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add, in that, supporting that strategy. And it -- not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsource CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products, that can be sold as stand-alone, but even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO or other elements of the risk spectrum."

But if",542,"Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. The -- I think it's -- my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools, both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple of years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up, savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France. And those products increasingly are not only growing, but the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good, generally. Enter Brexit, tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means, and how the U.K. will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it'll take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogenous market, Europe you've got 20 different markets, and so the notion of passporting or creating product in 1 domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures OEICs, SICAV, UCITS. OEICs, for existence -- for example, are created in the U.K., and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the U.K. and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition OEICs to things like SICAVs, then where they ought to do that. We are the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think, the big winners will be the offshore centers, Luxembourg and probably more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple of years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, the -- when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business, some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaulo deal give us a leading presence in Italy, we've always been in the U.K., we've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products with the most geography covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we're at the top of that pyramid, some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe, hence, the enthusiasm."

First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, Project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so, yes, I do believe that Project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success as we talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us. Now, it doesn't mean that there is an upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around the RRP, but the -- I do think that we've shown that we're executing on the plan that we had previously communicated, which is to make that shift, which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity, under the severely adverse scenario, is quite a bit better than what had been done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rule. So yes, I feel good about all that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the -- but outside of the U.S., it's still been moving at a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point. But I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later."

I think, you started out with the cloud, then Beacon, and that's critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment. But even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services vis-à-vis the competitors in the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket, too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So whether it's a mutual fund manager of moving to outsource middle-office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base, based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see in the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that. Because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients. Again, it's forcing both of those things to happen. I think, similarly, in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years to transition. I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have, but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think, the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes. And GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace. But this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the Asset Management world, and I think, we're well positioned, and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our cost better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally, which is where the future is going to be with regard to the client's needs, and I'd say Asset Management is going through a similar transition."

Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter: First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits, at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item, in particular, Q2 versus Q1, that the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular; Second though, though it's a little bit of a funny nuance, we do have, in any given quarter, decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed, or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap cost that we normally run through that line, that was a, it was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side. So no net impact to the NIM. And in fact, you can see the decline in the interest-bearing deposits with banks line item, that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S."

So I mean, they were up very modestly Q2 versus Q1 on average.  But I don't, at this point, feel pressure to reduce those further in the second half of the year. And with any good fortune here, maybe in 2017, we'll get some additional Fed fund increases, maybe even in December. And that would probably reduce them further on their own, without explicit action. But it's something, obviously, we monitor very carefully. And particularly, in situations where there's potentially a flight to quality, it's something that we'd have to watch very carefully.

First, as I mentioned a couple of times, we did have 4 specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category. Pre-pay in the second quarter, and the result of those 4 discrete securities prepaying in total was a onetime boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS numbers. So if you do that, the 143 yield for ABS that you see in the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the $132 million from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline, and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in -- for the euro deposits, in particular. Going the other way though was, in fact, the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed-rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed-rate investments. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously. But I'd first washout the $5 million. And then, those -- the 2 points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter."

And whether it's #1 in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share, or U.S. mutual funds, where I reference the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on. What -- the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows. And over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher-yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs, you've seen a retrenchment, generally from emerging markets, which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So I would say the effective markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding, and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously, the market. So I would say, we think, long-term that we're best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us, it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in this segment and the most attractive segments, and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day that we're keeping our expenses in line so that we can maintain our margin and as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I reference then, we would assume that, that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflects strong fee growth compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remained strong across our global client base, as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multiyear digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients. 
As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements, subject to final approval, that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources. So where possible and appropriate, we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to Slide 5 of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. 
In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services, we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016, we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight-through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier, and reduction of manual transactions. Our fund administration digitization prototype is under way and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. 
Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of -- by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.'s Japanese investment trust business. 
Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. 
We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business, driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly, these outflows are primarily on our low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our high-yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter, we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflective -- reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016, and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. 
We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy. And earlier this month, on July 1, we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher-growth and return businesses. It's also an important part of SSgA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities, including active management, alternative and outsourced chief investment officer capabilities. 
With our focus on expense management, we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pretax expense savings in 2016. 
We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Fed Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our common -- quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share starting in the third quarter of 2016, subject to Board of Directors approval. 
We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. 
Moving to Slide #6. I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. 
Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the U.K. represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management, and it's expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates, while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. 
In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing that are -- are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. 
We have a deep and diversified presence in the Europe as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the U.K. with the majority being situated in 9 European countries under our recently consolidated international bank, which is based in Germany. Given this presence, we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. 
We're well positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last 3 years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. 
Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short- and long-term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post-EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the U.K. and in pan-European fund structures and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short- and long-term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?"
188785,365727473,1014142,"State Street Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/R",1243,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. 
First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $53 million. 
Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses. 
Now refer to Slide 7 in the slide presentation for a discussion of operating basis results for 2Q '16 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 
By way of summary, 2Q '16 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q '16 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q '15 and increased from 1Q '16, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Year-to-date, EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets, as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. 
Importantly, 2Q '16 total expenses decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pretax margin to 31.5% in 2Q '16. 
The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax-advantaged investments. 
Regarding capital, in 2Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. 
Moving to Slide 9. I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q '16 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q '16, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. 
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 2Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q '16 due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q '15 due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q '15, primarily reflecting continued growth in an Enhanced Custody, mostly offset by lower seasonal benefit compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher Fed funds rate at the end of 4Q '15 as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '15, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 2Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well controlled in 2Q '16, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q '15. 2Q '16 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q '16 when excluding the 1Q '16 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Compared to 2Q '15, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly primarily due to increased cost to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q '15, driven by a significant reduction in professional services costs. 
We now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully phased-in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corp increased to 6.1% and the bank increased to 6.3% primarily due to preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. 
Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on Slide 16. 
We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q '16 under our prior common stock purchase program announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving on now to the next slide. Let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher-growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the full -- for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016. 
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. 
Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions. Included in our expectation to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. 
Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. 
Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pretax fiscal savings in 2016. 
Moving on to net interest revenue for full year 2016. We currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q '16 results and sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue. And strong expense control, positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.

The Beacon effort, as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so cleanup a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit, one of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day, produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally. And the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds the newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 to 30 minutes, which, in a 1.5-hour window, is significant. So clients who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early, it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane, but to our clients, it's a huge win. I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy in how data flows back to our clients. I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon, but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this. And when we established global exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit of digitizing our internal production environment or to provide information and analytics services to our clients not just back office but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So you've heard me say before to me it is the next big thing in this business, and we're making good progress."

And at this point, I anticipate that, that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously, it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move -- at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lockstep with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring, but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully."

I think maybe start out broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016. And primarily, I would focus on 2 areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full-time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that, that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to date here around Project Beacon.  And as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around Project Beacon. Specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year. And there are 3 pretty specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is we're -- we have known new business in the global servicing business, and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes, for example, the

So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this.

And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the preps that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pretax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration costs, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the -- less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following 3 quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it, a $240 million annualized number in Q3 to something in the $270 million to $300 million range in -- for the first full 12 months."

First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 mil",298,"So I would say there are a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So essentially, I mean, if you double that, you get to $150 million, and basically that syncs up with the point that I was making that we expect now the full year savings to be approximately $140 million for full year 2016 versus full year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in some, particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year as compared to the quarter 2 expense space. So from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses, and again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number. Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of '17. I think the main point is that we still expect the '17 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year '16. So it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target or to change the end date. But again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future."

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155.

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155. And so the, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S. and then likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the U.K. is -- are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue. As it relates -- actually one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on Slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have, it was actually 4 discrete securities prepay, so it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and in Q4. So if you're really -- if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million, again, just -- it'll help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect, at this point, to have to issue additional long-term debt, just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer-term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now again TLAC at this point is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long-term debt just because of RRP.

Let me pick that one up. The -- so first point is that in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities in separate accounts, so not ETFs, and I would say the other theme which I referenced is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based, sovereign wealth funds looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them, from a standpoint of the fees, and more particularly, the management fees. And we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the Gold Fund, is probably more of a product for the times, but we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely. High-fee products from our standpoint, the multi-asset class. And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months, to focus on those higher fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter, and the management fee growth of almost 5%. Some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of the year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business, mostly based on introducing higher-yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher ends of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add, in that, supporting that strategy. And it -- not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsource CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products, that can be sold as stand-alone, but even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO or other elements of the risk spectrum."

But if",542,"Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. The -- I think it's -- my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools, both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple of years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up, savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France. And those products increasingly are not only growing, but the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good, generally. Enter Brexit, tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means, and how the U.K. will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it'll take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogenous market, Europe you've got 20 different markets, and so the notion of passporting or creating product in 1 domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures OEICs, SICAV, UCITS. OEICs, for existence -- for example, are created in the U.K., and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the U.K. and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition OEICs to things like SICAVs, then where they ought to do that. We are the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think, the big winners will be the offshore centers, Luxembourg and probably more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple of years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, the -- when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business, some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaulo deal give us a leading presence in Italy, we've always been in the U.K., we've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products with the most geography covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we're at the top of that pyramid, some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe, hence, the enthusiasm."

First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, Project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so, yes, I do believe that Project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success as we talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us. Now, it doesn't mean that there is an upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around the RRP, but the -- I do think that we've shown that we're executing on the plan that we had previously communicated, which is to make that shift, which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity, under the severely adverse scenario, is quite a bit better than what had been done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rule. So yes, I feel good about all that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the -- but outside of the U.S., it's still been moving at a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point. But I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later."

I think, you started out with the cloud, then Beacon, and that's critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment. But even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services vis-à-vis the competitors in the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket, too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So whether it's a mutual fund manager of moving to outsource middle-office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base, based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see in the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that. Because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients. Again, it's forcing both of those things to happen. I think, similarly, in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years to transition. I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have, but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think, the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes. And GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace. But this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the Asset Management world, and I think, we're well positioned, and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our cost better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally, which is where the future is going to be with regard to the client's needs, and I'd say Asset Management is going through a similar transition."

Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter: First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits, at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item, in particular, Q2 versus Q1, that the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular; Second though, though it's a little bit of a funny nuance, we do have, in any given quarter, decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed, or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap cost that we normally run through that line, that was a, it was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side. So no net impact to the NIM. And in fact, you can see the decline in the interest-bearing deposits with banks line item, that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S."

First, as I mentioned a couple of times, we did have 4 specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category. Pre-pay in the second quarter, and the result of those 4 discrete securities prepaying in total was a onetime boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS numbers. So if you do that, the 143 yield for ABS that you see in the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the $132 million from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline, and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in -- for the euro deposits, in particular. Going the other way though was, in fact, the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed-rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed-rate investments. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously. But I'd first washout the $5 million. And then, those -- the 2 points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter."

And whether it's #1 in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share, or U.S. mutual funds, where I reference the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on. What -- the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows. And over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher-yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs, you've seen a retrenchment, generally from emerging markets, which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So I would say the effective markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding, and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously, the market. So I would say, we think, long-term that we're best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us, it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in this segment and the most attractive segments, and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day that we're keeping our expenses in line so that we can maintain our margin and as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I reference then, we would assume that, that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflects strong fee growth compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remained strong across our global client base, as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multiyear digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients. 
As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements, subject to final approval, that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources. So where possible and appropriate, we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. 
I'd now like to turn your attention to Slide 5 of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. 
In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services, we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016, we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight-through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier, and reduction of manual transactions. Our fund administration digitization prototype is under way and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. 
Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of -- by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.'s Japanese investment trust business. 
Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. 
We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business, driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly, these outflows are primarily on our low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our high-yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter, we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflective -- reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016, and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. 
We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy. And earlier this month, on July 1, we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher-growth and return businesses. It's also an important part of SSgA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities, including active management, alternative and outsourced chief investment officer capabilities. 
With our focus on expense management, we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pretax expense savings in 2016. 
We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Fed Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our common -- quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share starting in the third quarter of 2016, subject to Board of Directors approval. 
We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. 
Moving to Slide #6. I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. 
Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the U.K. represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management, and it's expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates, while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. 
In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing that are -- are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. 
We have a deep and diversified presence in the Europe as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the U.K. with the majority being situated in 9 European countries under our recently consolidated international bank, which is based in Germany. Given this presence, we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. 
We're well positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last 3 years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. 
Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short- and long-term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post-EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the U.K. and in pan-European fund structures and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short- and long-term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?"
188785,365727473,1014526,"State Street Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/R",1243,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include 2 notable items. 
First, on April 1, 2016, we sold the WM/Reuters-branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $53 million. 
Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses. 
Now refer to Slide 7 in the slide presentation for a discussion of operating basis results for 2Q '16 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 
By way of summary, 2Q '16 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q '16 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q '15 and increased from 1Q '16, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Year-to-date, EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets, as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. 
Importantly, 2Q '16 total expenses decreased compared to the year-ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pretax margin to 31.5% in 2Q '16. 
The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax-advantaged investments. 
Regarding capital, in 2Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. 
Moving to Slide 9. I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q '16 compared to the year-ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q '16, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. 
I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 2Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q '16 due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q '15 due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q '15, primarily reflecting continued growth in an Enhanced Custody, mostly offset by lower seasonal benefit compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher Fed funds rate at the end of 4Q '15 as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '15, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 2Q '16 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well controlled in 2Q '16, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q '15. 2Q '16 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q '16 when excluding the 1Q '16 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retiring eligible employees and payroll taxes. 
Compared to 2Q '15, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly primarily due to increased cost to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q '15, driven by a significant reduction in professional services costs. 
We now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully phased-in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corp increased to 6.1% and the bank increased to 6.3% primarily due to preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. 
Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on Slide 16. 
We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q '16 under our prior common stock purchase program announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving on now to the next slide. Let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher-growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the full -- for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016. 
Moving to Slide 17. I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. 
Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions. Included in our expectation to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. 
Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. 
Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pretax fiscal savings in 2016. 
Moving on to net interest revenue for full year 2016. We currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q '16 results and sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue. And strong expense control, positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.

The Beacon effort, as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so cleanup a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit, one of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day, produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally. And the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds the newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 to 30 minutes, which, in a 1.5-hour window, is significant. So clients who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early, it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane, but to our clients, it's a huge win. I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy in how data flows back to our clients. I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon, but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this. And when we established global exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit of digitizing our internal production environment or to provide information and analytics services to our clients not just back office but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So you've heard me say before to me it is the next big thing in this business, and we're making good progress."

And at this point, I anticipate that, that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously, it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move -- at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lockstep with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring, but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully."

I think maybe start out broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016. And primarily, I would focus on 2 areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full-time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that, that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to date here around Project Beacon.  And as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around Project Beacon. Specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year. And there are 3 pretty specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is we're -- we have known new business in the global servicing business, and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes, for example, the

So overall, for the first 12 months of the arrangement, so July 1 '16 through June 30, 2017, we expect the overall revenue contribution to be in a range of $270 million to $300 million. And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the preps that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pretax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration costs, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the -- less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following 3 quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it, a $240 million annualized number in Q3 to something in the $270 million to $300 million range in -- for the first full 12 months."

First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 mil",298,"So I would say there are a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016 relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015 was approximately $75 million. So essentially, I mean, if you double that, you get to $150 million, and basically that syncs up with the point that I was making that we expect now the full year savings to be approximately $140 million for full year 2016 versus full year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in some, particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year as compared to the quarter 2 expense space. So from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses, and again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number. Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of '17. I think the main point is that we still expect the '17 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year '16. So it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target or to change the end date. But again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future."

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155.

So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think, the 10-year's at about 155. And so the, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S. and then likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the U.K. is -- are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue. As it relates -- actually one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on Slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have, it was actually 4 discrete securities prepay, so it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and in Q4. So if you're really -- if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million, again, just -- it'll help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect, at this point, to have to issue additional long-term debt, just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer-term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now again TLAC at this point is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long-term debt just because of RRP. But, again, it's, the whole RRP situation's a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine."

The -- so first point is that in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities in separate accounts, so not ETFs, and I would say the other theme which I referenced is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based, sovereign wealth funds looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them, from a standpoint of the fees, and more particularly, the management fees. And we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the Gold Fund, is probably more of a product for the times, but we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely. High-fee products from our standpoint, the multi-asset class. And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months, to focus on those higher fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter, and the management fee growth of almost 5%. Some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of the year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business, mostly based on introducing higher-yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher ends of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add, in that, supporting that strategy. And it -- not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsource CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products, that can be sold as stand-alone, but even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO or other elements of the risk spectrum."

But if",542,"Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. The -- I think it's -- my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools, both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple of years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up, savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France. And those products increasingly are not only growing, but the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good, generally. Enter Brexit, tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means, and how the U.K. will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it'll take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogenous market, Europe you've got 20 different markets, and so the notion of passporting or creating product in 1 domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures OEICs, SICAV, UCITS. OEICs, for existence -- for example, are created in the U.K., and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the U.K. and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition OEICs to things like SICAVs, then where they ought to do that. We are the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think, the big winners will be the offshore centers, Luxembourg and probably more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple of years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, the -- when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business, some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaulo deal give us a leading presence in Italy, we've always been in the U.K., we've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products with the most geography covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we're at the top of that pyramid, some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe, hence, the enthusiasm."

First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, Project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so, yes, I do believe that Project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success as we talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us. Now, it doesn't mean that there is an upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around the RRP, but the -- I do think that we've shown that we're executing on the plan that we had previously communicated, which is to make that shift, which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity, under the severely adverse scenario, is quite a bit better than what had been done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rule. So yes, I feel good about all that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the -- but outside of the U.S., it's still been moving at a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point. But I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later."

I think, you started out with the cloud, then Beacon, and that's critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment. But even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services vis-à-vis the competitors in the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket, too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So whether it's a mutual fund manager of moving to outsource middle-office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base, based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see in the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that. Because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients. Again, it's forcing both of those things to happen. I think, similarly, in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years to transition. I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have, but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think, the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes. And GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace. But this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the Asset Management world, and I think, we're well positioned, and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our cost better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally, which is where the future is going to be with regard to the client's needs, and I'd say Asset Management is going through a similar transition."

Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter: First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits, at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item, in particular, Q2 versus Q1, that the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular; Second though, though it's a little bit of a funny nuance, we do have, in any given quarter, decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed, or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap cost that we normally run through that line, that was a, it was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side. So no net impact to the NIM. And in fact, you can see the decline in the interest-bearing deposits with banks line item, that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S."

First, as I mentioned a couple of times, we did have 4 specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category. Pre-pay in the second quarter, and the result of those 4 discrete securities prepaying in total was a onetime boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS numbers. So if you do that, the 143 yield for ABS that you see in the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the $132 million from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline, and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in -- for the euro deposits, in particular. Going the other way though was, in fact, the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed-rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed-rate investments. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously. But I'd first washout the $5 million. And then, those -- the 2 points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter."

And whether it's #1 in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share, or U.S. mutual funds, where I reference the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on. What -- the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows. And over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher-yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs, you've seen a retrenchment, generally from emerging markets, which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So I would say the effective markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding, and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously, the market. So I would say, we think, long-term that we're best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us, it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in this segment and the most attractive segments, and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day that we're keeping our expenses in line so that we can maintain our margin and as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I reference then, we would assume that, that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view."

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.2 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date, including $212 billion in the third quarter.
We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to digitize our business to deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon, we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management.
The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well, with over 260 employees successfully onboarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSgA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities and enhances the value-add solutions to our clients.
I'll turn your attention to Slide #5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services through execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016, we continued to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breadth of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions, including: Net Asset Value Oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day; an Enhanced Asset Owner Strategy providing support to asset owner -- owners as they in-source asset management; and Enterprise Pricing Web, which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC Modernization rules that were finalized early [ph] October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients.
In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over $500 billion.
An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client, PIMCO, to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately, in a mandate that we have won, pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting, custody, fund administration and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds, which is a high-growth market segment. State Street's industry-leading offshore fund services business and operating platform were key considerations in PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street.
In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher-yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.
Separately, our State Street Global Exchange group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it and assess impact on the price, risk and liquidity of individual assets.
We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first 3 quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax expense savings in 2016 with the full effect felt in 2017.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority, and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock.
We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities, which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
We would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in 2017, given our focus on executing our multiyear strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event, and of course, we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO, Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO of Citizens and, prior to that, spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last 6 as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking, regulation, treasury and finance to the role of CFO, which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition, and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join our team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. To you, Mike."

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items.

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.
Now I refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16, which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance.
Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably, 3Q '16 pretax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business.
On the capital front, in 3Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share, representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.
Moving to Slide 7. We're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.
Now I'll turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Management fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16, primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE Asset Management acquisition.
Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15 primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15, primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 10. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '16, primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and a small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably, expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE Asset Management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost to support new business.
I'll now move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully phased-in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE Asset Management. The September 30th fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly primarily due to the GE Asset Management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 at [ph] our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.
Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16, GE Asset Management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.
Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management.
3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.
We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015 and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur the [ph] regulatory-related expenses.
Importantly, we now expect to deliver, through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax savings for full year 2016.
Moving on to the net interest revenue, we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16 and for full year NIR to exceed the high end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.
In summary, we're pleased that the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.
And now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

The service fees were up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just the quarter. I think if you look at full year, we're up 5%, which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- we had markets mixed, EFA [ph] down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's the -- as oppose to 1%, if you look 3 quarters to date, the 5%, I think, is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning, as is typically the case, is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins, highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently, the PIMCO deal, which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets and a place that, because of Brexit and other things, I think, we'll continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of Lux and Dublin. I guess, the one other point I'd might make from a highlight standpoint is you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance. So we've seen some outflows in hedge funds. My view is that, that's more likely cyclical. I think performance recently has improved. I suspect the flows may hit back the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere, so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate, which we view as a positive situation from a standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, a little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K. on the European markets given some big deals and a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story."

Let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward in providing a more diversified and frankly, active-oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities and fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had, and I think we've nicely filled that gap. You heard from Mike's commentary the we're off to a good start with GE Asset Management. I think we're -- we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive, which still dominates the AUMs in the active business. Increasingly, we're investing, as we talked about, in ETFs, and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs, which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally but [ph] we can combine the passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter. We had good uptick and inflows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint, Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big GAAP, and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe, and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product lineup. But your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry, and I happen to think that, that -- we're probably more [ph] in the beginning of that phase in the end, but we feel pretty good with regard to the competences -- competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market globally."

And we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment just given all the uncertainty and the turbulence as a result of money market before. And we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that caused us, obviously, some NIR, but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the roll-forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really, Ashley, is mainly the story that we've talked about previously. We -- the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe, continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in -- at today. And so as a result of that grind in the rates, we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q.

I'll first take it from an asset management dimension, which maybe was the way you are initially headed. But from a fiduciary rule, the impact of that on product and distribution, I think, it leads to more model-based product. And SSgA just recently, in the last couple of weeks, announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they're using [ph] we've got an investment and then a global [ph] adviser, which we'll use the global [ph] adviser to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model, which, in this case, happens to be sponsored by SSgA, is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset-servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF-servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but the distributor's position us well as ETFs and other more quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say, and this is on a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect, and we're already seeing some of this, of -- from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that resolved in end of day pricing for a product or a group of products. I think it advantaged the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull out that all together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So I would say in some, it would be on the servicing side. I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution -- really, how product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule. And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon, the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing, will also advantage the product manufacturers who are our key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product for to meet the new fiduciary rule."

We get some benefit obviously on the expense side of that, but if I just focus on the fee revenue, the weakness in the pound first the translation to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talk about a minute ago, there continues to be some risks off in the environment and just even looking at some of the mixed change, for example, from the outflows, from hedge funds is a mild headwind, for example, for the AIS fees.

Round numbers, Ken, we're looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for Beacon 4Q versus Three Q, it's just not huge, but it's enough to potentially make the needle and the other piece that this continues to be on the RF pressure is the regulatory expense particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017 submission continues to be material.

So again, I don't expect that the -- that there'll be a lot of impact on the next CCAR, because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 CCAR, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes which impact the risk-based capital ratios again would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been our binding constraint.

But I do expect that net-net to be accretive. And first of all, it obviously helps us with our floating-rate securities here in the U.S it helps us with our loan book, which is mostly floating rate. It helped us with obviously the Central Bank deposits. And so all of that, I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposits rates. The other piece, just to be balanced though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt, a significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all grade D but I definitely expected to be accretive. Just to be balanced though, your question was focused on the U.S. as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the negative impact of the portfolio turnover, Europe, the combination of [indiscernible] rates and of course depressed spreads because of QE over there.

I guess, do you expect more big contracts coming from large asset managers in the future? And then it sounds like Bank of New York is also getting a bit more aggressive obviously with the 0 deal and also on even with a more standardized. If you could sort of differentiate yourself in this space and talk about whether you think views change in the growth outlook and then pricing dynamics and mid-office."

The short answer is yes.

The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration I'd caught in the last couple of years through its outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke, Allianz being probably the most prominent 1, is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more are coming at us in a bundled way or even in the form off and I'd say the PIMCO and Allianz separate transactions. Both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play and all that should accrue or benefit. If I isolate our middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables, we have over $10 trillion in middle office assets that we support on our technology. And like most of the activities that we conduct in the asset servicing business, scale matters. So with over $10 trillion in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit costs. We have the ability to invest disproportionately in our unit -- in our middle office platform. And so I take you back to Beacon, which as we ought to make this grate more straight processing as we in the back of the middle office have updated GX acquisition product. The scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product, we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think and I'm going to -- this is a pivot, if you go from middle office to what's the next frontier, it's who is going to win the data aggregation. And we've got just short of 10 clients who have committed to us to allow us to be the data aggregator, not just for the information that we hold in our back in middle office but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me, that ties directly into Beacon but the long game here is if you could be the data aggregator, you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities. We referenced a few in my prepared comments so I drift in your question but I think it's a good one, which is they're is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services. Not only more services but more value-added services as we move up to the data aggregation and global exchange level."

And that will be in mid-office you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry? In other words, you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve margins in that business, that would be one question. And you just mentioned on data aggregation and I guess since they usually ask you this at Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that so I don't know if you can given you're not [indiscernible] Investor Day this year provide any sort of big picture idea about whether you think there will be some revenue traction in 2017 from the data aggregation initiative?"

So let me take the first one, first middle office pricing is scale affect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale, we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job of standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean, what we sell is middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value, not the price advantage. And I think that people that evaluate our middle office, they view it against their own in-house capabilities and they view us making the investment in technology, usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I'd say the scale effect is to our advantage. We work hard not to lead with price but yet, lead with value and preserve the margin. And you -- the point is obvious, but as the asset management industry is under pressure, we're feeling that pressure to so the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective and more efficient model when we combine our customers front office, our middle back et cetera is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and Global Exchange, I think it's a slow-building opportunity. I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute. The more you do, the better you get, the greater advantage you have, which is once we wire together, not only our digital back and middle office, but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office. There's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us because we've already prewired those relationships. And so we're making a pretty big investment in what we call data GX, which is the aggregation layer of information, not just for State Street but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data and analytics product that sits on top of that, and I think that's when you'll really start to see some revenue momentum. So I'd say its a slow burn but a study upward bias on the revenue side. And as we get into 2017, we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you."

So and I think that at least the first couple of steps of that are well understood and we're well on our way and I have high confidence that we'll achieve those synergy opportunities.

So one of the things that we're looking at is what can we offset that by additional actions on the liability pricing side. And I would say at this point, we're simply looking at various options, not at a point -- at this point ready to announce some additional actions, but that is an area that we're keenly focused.

I think you know some of it, but he in his most recent 6 years with Citi, he was the Treasurer.

So importantly, he comes to us not just with deep financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point, Mike, the Beacon activity, well Mike certainly reports on has some visibility to what is largely centered on the operating environment so Mike Rogers is the President and Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity. Some of it would affect the corporate support groups, but its primarily in the asset servicing custody, middle office, back office. I would see no blip in transition and will only hope that with Eric, with his knowledge on this business, might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we could do.

And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition will be in the business that we call global exchange, which I referenced earlier in the data aggregation. And then more importantly, on top of that the data and analytics business or the data and analytics opportunity, which I think is significant and is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would, if you take data and analytics and first -- and separate those 2 things, the data is the 1 part and I think in some respects is the higher part, which is aggregating and providing realtime data insights to the front office. But on top of that is analytics, whether it's risk analytics whether it's some of the things we do with big data. I could see smallish acquisitions on the data and analytics side, which would take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics.

Perhaps modest growth from where it is today. We've have a yield on that block currently of approximately 3.7%. So it's an attractive book. And at this point, if we knock unwed, very good credit experience out there. I feel like we're doing a good job of underwriting and managing the credits there. I'd really wouldn't put us at this point, Gerard, a long-term expectation out there. Again, I would expect to beat the overall portfolio averages given our credit underwriting and our bias towards being at the higher end of the scale. At this point, I really wouldn't try to put a long-term estimate on it but its something that we'll continue to manage and we're very sensitive to the changes in the credit cycle."

Number  one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016 relative to 2015. We've talked about this on prior calls. We've seen, for example, more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the U.S. And so basically, the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets, for example, to developed markets, particularly the U.S., has a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there. Second as we talked about earlier, we've seen some outflows in terms of the hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds, but certainly that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue. And as we talked about previously, our AIS revenue also tends to be at a higher unit revenue per asset service than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for currency and markets, that really is the story. All the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios of relative to assets. Because that -- all the factors that I just mentioned play havoc with those ratios, particularly if you're looking at it in the short-term period."

In addition, I think its fair to say that over the long term, we think emerging markets is in fact, a very good place to be in and ultimately, we would expect that we'll see some rotation back there and we'll see some help on the currency side there relative to what has been a challenging environment, certainly call it over the last year."

And shortly after the announcement, we announced a reorganization, which brought those groups together. So there's a fair amount synergy just tied up and when you take your fundamental equity business that SSgA, combine it with GE and get synergies out of that because I would say for the corporate support areas and also in the different asset classes where, in many cases, SSgA had some capabilities just not as robust as the GE Asset Management.

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.2 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date, including $212 billion in the third quarter.
We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to digitize our business to deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon, we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management.
The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well, with over 260 employees successfully onboarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSgA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities and enhances the value-add solutions to our clients.
I'll turn your attention to Slide #5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services through execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016, we continued to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breadth of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions, including: Net Asset Value Oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day; an Enhanced Asset Owner Strategy providing support to asset owner -- owners as they in-source asset management; and Enterprise Pricing Web, which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC Modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients.
In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over $500 billion.
An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client, PIMCO, to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately, in a mandate that we have won, pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting, custody, fund administration and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds, which is a high-growth market segment. State Street's industry-leading offshore fund services business and operating platform were key considerations in PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street.
In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher-yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.
Separately, our State Street Global Exchange group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it and assess impact on the price, risk and liquidity of individual assets.
We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first 3 quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax expense savings in 2016 with the full effect felt in 2017.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority, and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock.
We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities, which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
We would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in 2017, given our focus on executing our multiyear strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event, and of course, we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO, Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO of Citizens and, prior to that, spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last 6 as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking, regulation, treasury and finance to the role of CFO, which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition, and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join our team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. To you, Mike."

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.
Now I refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16, which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance.
Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably, 3Q '16 pretax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business.
On the capital front, in 3Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share, representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.
Moving to Slide 7. We're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.
Now I'll turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Management fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16, primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE Asset Management acquisition.
Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15 primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15, primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 10. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '16, primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and a small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably, expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE Asset Management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost to support new business.
I'll now move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully phased-in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE Asset Management. The September 30th fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly primarily due to the GE Asset Management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 at our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.
Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16, GE Asset Management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.
Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management.
3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.
We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015 and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur the regulatory-related expenses.
Importantly, we now expect to deliver, through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax savings for full year 2016.
Moving on to the net interest revenue, we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16 and for full year NIR to exceed the high end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.
In summary, we're pleased that the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.
And now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

The service fees were up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just the quarter. I think if you look at full year, we're up 5%, which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- we had markets mixed, IFA down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's the -- as oppose to 1%, if you look 3 quarters to date, the 5%, I think, is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning, as is typically the case, is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins, highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently, the PIMCO deal, which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets and a place that, because of Brexit and other things, I think, we'll continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of Lux and Dublin. I guess, the one other point I'd might make from a highlight standpoint is you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance. So we've seen some outflows in hedge funds. My view is that, that's more likely cyclical. I think performance recently has improved. I suspect the flows may hit back the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere, so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate, which we view as a positive situation from a standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, a little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K. on the European markets given some big deals and a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story."

Let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward in providing a more diversified and frankly, active-oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities and fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had, and I think we've nicely filled that gap. You heard from Mike's commentary the we're off to a good start with GE Asset Management. I think we're -- we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive, which still dominates the AUMs in the active business. Increasingly, we're investing, as we talked about, in ETFs, and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs, which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally but we can combine the passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter. We had good uptick and inflows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint, Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big GAAP, and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe, and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product lineup. But your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry, and I happen to think that, that -- we're probably at more the beginning of that phase in the end, but we feel pretty good with regard to the competences -- competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market globally."

So Ashley, first, in terms of the wholesale funding, we did expand our use of wholesale funding in 3Q relative to 2Q by approximately $2.5 billion. And we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment just given all the uncertainty and the turbulence as a result of money market before. And we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that caused us, obviously, some NIR, but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the roll-forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really, Ashley, is mainly the story that we've talked about previously. We -- the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe, continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in -- at today. And so as a result of that grind in the rates, we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. Now there are a lot of moving parts in any given quarter, but those are really the headlines."

I'll first take it from an asset management dimension, which maybe was the way you are initially headed. But from a fiduciary rule, the impact of that on product and distribution, I think, it leads to more model-based product. And SSgA just recently, in the last couple of weeks, announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they're using -- we've got an investment and then a Robo adviser, which we'll use the Robo adviser to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model, which, in this case, happens to be sponsored by SSgA, is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset-servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF-servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but the distributor's position us well as ETFs and other more quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say, and this is on a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect, and we're already seeing some of this, of -- from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of a full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result in end-of-day pricing for a product or a group of products, I think advantaged the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull all out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So I would say, in some, it would be on the servicing side. I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really, how product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule. And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon, the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing, will also advantage the product manufacturers who are our key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product for -- to meet the new fiduciary rule."

But if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact, particularly in the U.K., is a headwind for the rest of the year as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So as an example, the pound-based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue. We get some benefit, obviously, on the expense side of that, but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue, the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago, there continues to be some risk-off in the environment. And just even looking at some of the mix change, for example, from the outflows, from hedge funds is a mild headwind, for example, for the AIS fees. And then I looked at the S&P 500 this morning.

So I would say too early to give you specifics. We'll give you more in 3 months. But those are the areas that we're really focused on."

The -- first, Tarullo speech in the NPR that came out that day, at this point, it is simply a proposed rule. So I think until things get finalized, I wouldn't overweight them too much. But your underlying point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous fed modeling, which had the balance sheet growing under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us because Tier 1 leverage rather than the risk-based ratios has been our binding constraint historically. So again, I don't expect that the -- that there'll be a lot of impact on the next CCAR because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 CCAR, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the risk-based capital ratios, again, would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been our binding constraint. But I'd say it's early, Jim. It's a positive, but it's also -- it's an early days positive at this point."

Well, first of all, a rate hike, if I just isolate on that causal factor first, I would expect the rate hike to be helpful, to be accretive for us. I mean, I would expect it would probably keep less of the benefit from the next fed fund rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to us, I think we'll probably have some modest increase on the liabilities side for our clients. But I do expect that net-net to be accretive. And first of all, it obviously helps us with our floating-rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book, which is mostly floating rate. It helps us with, obviously, the Central Bank deposits. And so all of that, I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. The other piece, just to be balanced, though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt, a significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all Grade B, but it would -- I definitely expect it to be accretive. Just to be balanced, though, that's -- your question was focused on the U.S., as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the negative impact of a portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. You want to balance that out, and obviously, as we -- when we talk beginning in January about 2017 outlook, we'll get some perspective on that."

The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years through it",492,"Sure, Brian. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years through its outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, Allianz being probably the most prominent one, is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more are coming at us in a bundled way or even in the form of, and I'd say, the PIMCO and Allianz separate transactions. Both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play, and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate our middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables, we have over $10 trillion in middle office assets that we support on our technology. And like most of the activities that we conduct in the asset servicing business, scale matters. So with over $10 trillion in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit costs. We have the ability to invest disproportionately in our unit -- in our middle office platform. And so I take you back to Beacon, which is, as we ought to make and create more straight-through processing as we on the back of the middle office have updated GX aggregation product, the scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product, we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think, and I'm going to -- this is the pivot, if you go from middle office to what's the next frontier, it's who is going to win the data aggregation for. And we've got just short of 10 clients who have committed to us to allow us to be the data aggregator, not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me, that ties directly into Beacon. But the long game here is if you can be the data aggregator, you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities. We referenced a few in my prepared comments. So I drift on your question, but I think it's a good one, which is there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, not only more services but more value-added services as we move up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level."

And that would be, in mid-office, you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry? In other words, do you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in that business? That would be one question. And then the -- you just mentioned on data aggregation, and I guess since -- I usually ask you this at Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that, so I don't know if you can, given you're not doing an Investor Day this year, provide any sort of big picture idea about whether do you think there will be some revenue traction in 2017 from the data aggregation initiative."

So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing th",390,"Sure. So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean, what we sell is a middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value, not the price advantage. And I think that people that evaluate our middle office, they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology, usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I'd say the scale effect is, to our advantage, we work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margin. And you -- the point is obvious, but as the asset management industry is under pressure, we're feeling that pressure, too, so the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective and more efficient model when we combine our customers, front office, our middle back, et cetera is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and Global Exchange, I think it's a slow-building opportunity. The -- I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute. The more you do, the better you get, the greater advantage you have, which is once we wire together, not only our digital back and middle office, but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office, there's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us because we've already prewired those relationships. And so we're making a pretty big investment in what we call data GX, which is the aggregation layer of information, not just for State Street but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data and analytics products that sit on top of that, and I think that's when you'll really start to see some revenue momentum. So I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side. And as we get into 2017, we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you."

Let me take that, Alex. The -- as you point out, the GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see, and part of the synergy opportunities, which is inherent in the deal and which is likely to unfold over the next 2 or 3 quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSgA is. But we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSgA is today, and that's part of the mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in '18 and '20. So -- and I think that at least the first couple of steps of that are well understood, and we're well on our way, and I have high confidence that we'll achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we can bring into the mix, making great progress, huge and helpful support by GE, and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this mix, which is office and CIO kind of business, which is -- just makes us bigger and more impactful on that segment."

And as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier, one of the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very low credit spreads, the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is what -- can we offset that by additional actions on the liability pricing side. And I would say, at this point, we're simply looking at various options. Not in a point -- at this point ready to announce some additional actions, but that is an area that we're keenly focused on. And then second, obviously, if the ECB cuts further, we'd have to look harder ourselves at following at least any decrement that the ECB would make.

I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent 6 years with Citi, he was the Treasurer. But before that, I think on equivalent period, ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi and within that, also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he's -- he comes to us not just with deep financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point, Mike, the Beacon activity, well, Mike, certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what is largely centered in the operating environment. So Mike Rogers who is the President and Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity.

So I would say that the big A is unlikely; the little A is maybe more likely. And when I think of places where we could perhaps use a little help on -- and it's probably more on the product side, the 2 places I land would be in asset management and -- not contrary to my earlier point, I think we've got a pretty comprehensive set of capabilities in asset management. But if there was a team or -- there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes that could be in scope. And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier and the data aggregation. And then more importantly, on top of that, the data and analytics business or the data and analytics opportunity, which I think is significant and is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would, if you take data and analytics and first -- and separate those 2 things, the data is the 1 part, and I think, in some respects, it's the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real-time data insights to the front office. But on top of that is analytics, whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with big data. I could see smallish acquisitions on the data and analytics side, which would take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the 2 places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see it appear on custody space, just to state the obvious."

One, I think that the regulatory hurdle would be high for the big asset servicing firms to be further concentrated in the custody business. And then I would also say that traditionally, whether it was the Deutsche Bank acquisition or IBT or even Intesa Sanpaolo, it filled the gap, Deutsche Bank in Europe, Intesa in Italy. And I don't see real gaps. If I look at our geographic coverage, we'd love to be doing more in China or in India. We're all over it. Acquisition is not likely the way to get there. Other than that, we're pretty well developed in most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets. And if you look at the -- looked at it through our product lens, Gerard, I think if you look at it all the way from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives, again, we're pretty well positioned. We think there's a meaningful opportunity in the real estate asset class, which is kind of brimming with assets to do more outsourcing there. But -- so I just don't see big gaps, and I think it would be a high hurdle from a regulatory standpoint."

Number one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016 relative to 2015. We've talked about this on prior calls. We've seen, for example, more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the U.S. And so basically, the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets, for example, to the developed markets, particularly the U.S., has a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there. Second, as we talked about earlier, we've seen some outflows in terms of the hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds, but certainly, that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue. And as we've talked about previously, our AIS revenue also tends to be at a higher unit revenue per asset serviced than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for currency and markets, that really is the story. All the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios relative to assets.

I think that if you look at the GE Asset Management deal, whenever you combined 2 asset management deals, you'd expect a fair amount of synergy in the core corporate support kind of activities, and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSgA, mainly the alternatives, there were some alternatives at SSgA and maybe more importantly,, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement, we announced a reorganization, which brought those groups together. So there's a fair amount of synergy just tied up. And when you take your fundamental equity business at SSgA, combine it with GE and get the synergies out of that. So I would say it's in the corporate support areas and also in the different asset classes where, in many cases, SSgA had some capabilities just not as robust as the GE Asset Management.

Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon, we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management.
The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well, with over 260 employees successfully onboarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSgA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities and enhances the value-add solutions to our clients.
I'll turn your attention to Slide #5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services through execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016, we continued to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breadth of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions, including: Net Asset Value Oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day; an Enhanced Asset Owner Strategy providing support to asset owner -- owners as they in-source asset management; and Enterprise Pricing Web, which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC Modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients.
In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over $500 billion.
An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client, PIMCO, to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately, in a mandate that we have won, pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting, custody, fund administration and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds, which is a high-growth market segment. State Street's industry-leading offshore fund services business and operating platform were key considerations in PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street.
In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher-yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.
Separately, our State Street Global Exchange group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it and assess impact on the price, risk and liquidity of individual assets.
We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first 3 quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax expense savings in 2016 with the full effect felt in 2017.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority, and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock.
We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities, which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
We would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in 2017, given our focus on executing our multiyear strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event, and of course, we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO, Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO of Citizens and, prior to that, spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last 6 as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking, regulation, treasury and finance to the role of CFO, which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition, and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join our team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. To you, Mike."

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquis",1029,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.
Now I refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16, which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance.
Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably, 3Q '16 pretax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business.
On the capital front, in 3Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share, representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.
Moving to Slide 7. We're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.
Now I'll turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Management fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16, primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE Asset Management acquisition.
Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15 primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15, primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 10. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '16, primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and a small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably, expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE Asset Management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost to support new business.
I'll now move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully phased-in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE Asset Management. The September 30th fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly primarily due to the GE Asset Management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 at our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.
Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16, GE Asset Management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.
Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management.
3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.
We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015 and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur the regulatory-related expenses.
Importantly, we now expect to deliver, through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax savings for full year 2016.
Moving on to the net interest revenue, we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16 and for full year NIR to exceed the high end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.
In summary, we're pleased that the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.
And now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

The service fees were up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just the quarter. I think if you look at full year, we're up 5%, which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- we had markets mixed, IFA down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's the -- as oppose to 1%, if you look 3 quarters to date, the 5%, I think, is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning, as is typically the case, is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins, highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently, the PIMCO deal, which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets and a place that, because of Brexit and other things, I think, we'll continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of Lux and Dublin. I guess, the one other point I'd might make from a highlight standpoint is you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance. So we've seen some outflows in hedge funds. My view is that, that's more likely cyclical. I think performance recently has improved. I suspect the flows may hit back the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere, so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate, which we view as a positive situation from a standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, a little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K. on the European markets given some big deals and a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story."

Let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward in providing a more diversified and frankly, active-oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities and fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had, and I think we've nicely filled that gap. You heard from Mike's commentary the we're off to a good start with GE Asset Management. I think we're -- we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive, which still dominates the AUMs in the active business. Increasingly, we're investing, as we talked about, in ETFs, and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs, which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally but we can combine the passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter. We had good uptick and inflows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint, Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big GAAP, and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe, and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product lineup. But your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry, and I happen to think that, that -- we're probably at more the beginning of that phase in the end, but we feel pretty good with regard to the competences -- competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market globally."

And we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment just given all the uncertainty and the turbulence as a result of money market before. And we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that caused us, obviously, some NIR, but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the roll-forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really, Ashley, is mainly the story that we've talked about previously. We -- the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe, continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in -- at today. And so as a result of that grind in the rates, we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q.

I'll first take it from an asset management dimension, which maybe was the way you are initially headed. But from a fiduciary rule, the impact of that on product and distribution, I think, it leads to more model-based product. And SSgA just recently, in the last couple of weeks, announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they're using -- we've got an investment and then a Robo adviser, which we'll use the Robo adviser to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model, which, in this case, happens to be sponsored by SSgA, is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset-servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF-servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but the distributor's position us well as ETFs and other more quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say, and this is on a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect, and we're already seeing some of this, of -- from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of a full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result in end-of-day pricing for a product or a group of products, I think advantaged the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull all out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So I would say, in some, it would be on the servicing side.

And again, please, I view these as very minor tweaks as opposed to anything wholesale. But if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact, particularly in the U.K., is a headwind for the rest of the year as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So as an example, the pound-based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue. We get some benefit, obviously, on the expense side of that, but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue, the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago, there continues to be some risk-off in the environment. And just even looking at some of the mix change, for example, from the outflows, from hedge funds is a mild headwind, for example, for the AIS fees. And then I looked at the S&P 500 this morning. I think it was at 2,143, and that's off from where it's been. So again, can I really view these as tweaks? Hopefully, 3 months from now, we'll look back and say it's -- it was conservative.

So as an example, we expect net investments in fourth quarter of 2016 to exceed the additional savings that we'll get in 4Q '16. Now as I talked about earlier, we expect those investments to pay off very well in '17, '18, '19, particularly in 2018, 2019. So we think -- given our track record, we think that's very shareholder-friendly to make those investments at that level. Round numbers, Ken, we're looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for Beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's just not huge, but it's enough to potentially move the needle. And the other piece that just continues to be a -- an area of pressure is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017, submission continues to be material. But I think if we step back from the details in your questions, I would come back to the fact that I think we've done a very good job at managing expenses overall for the full year. Project Beacon, obviously, has been a big piece of it but also just clamping down on all the areas, and we're real pleased to be in a position to say that we expect our full year expenses to be below that of 2015 x GE."

The -- first, Tarullo speech in the NPR that came out that day, at this point, it is simply a proposed rule. So I think until things get finalized, I wouldn't overweight them too much. But your underlying point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous fed modeling, which had the balance sheet growing under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us because Tier 1 leverage rather than the risk-based ratios has been our binding constraint historically. So again, I don't expect that the -- that there'll be a lot of impact on the next CCAR because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 CCAR, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the risk-based capital ratios, again, would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been our binding constraint.

Well, first of all, a rate hike, if I just isolate on that causal factor first, I would expect the rate hike to be helpful, to be accretive for us. I mean, I would expect it would probably keep less of the benefit from the next fed fund rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to us, I think we'll probably have some modest increase on the liabilities side for our clients. But I do expect that net-net to be accretive. And first of all, it obviously helps us with our floating-rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book, which is mostly floating rate. It helps us with, obviously, the Central Bank deposits. And so all of that, I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. The other piece, just to be balanced, though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt, a significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all Grade B, but it would -- I definitely expect it to be accretive. Just to be balanced, though, that's -- your question was focused on the U.S., as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the negative impact of a portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. You want to balance that out, and obviously, as we -- when we talk beginning in January about 2017 outlook, we'll get some perspective on that."

The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards ou",491,"Sure, Brian. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, Allianz being probably the most prominent one, is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more are coming at us in a bundled way or even in the form of, and I'd say, the PIMCO and Allianz separate transactions. Both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play, and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate our middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables, we have over $10 trillion in middle office assets that we support on our technology. And like most of the activities that we conduct in the asset servicing business, scale matters. So with over $10 trillion in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit costs. We have the ability to invest disproportionately in our unit -- in our middle office platform. And so I take you back to Beacon, which is, as we ought to make and create more straight-through processing as we on the back of the middle office have updated GX aggregation product, the scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product, we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think, and I'm going to -- this is the pivot, if you go from middle office to what's the next frontier, it's who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who have committed to us to allow us to be the data aggregator, not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me, that ties directly into Beacon. But the long game here is if you can be the data aggregator, you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities. We referenced a few in my prepared comments. So I drift on your question, but I think it's a good one, which is, there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, not only more services but more value-added services as we move up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level."

And that would be, in mid-office, you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry? In other words, do you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in that business? That would be one question. And then the -- you just mentioned on data aggregation, and I guess since -- I usually ask you this at Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that, so I don't know if you can, given you're not doing an Investor Day this year, provide any sort of big picture idea about whether do you think there will be some revenue traction in 2017 from the data aggregation initiative."

So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing th",390,"Sure. So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean, what we sell is a middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value, not the price advantage. And I think that people that evaluate our middle office, they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology, usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I'd say the scale effect is, to our advantage, we work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margin. And you -- the point is obvious, but as the asset management industry is under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too, so the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective and more efficient model when we combine our customers, front office, our middle back, et cetera is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and Global Exchange, I think it's a slow-building opportunity. The -- I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute. The more you do, the better you get, the greater advantage you have, which is once we wire together, not only our digital back and middle office, but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office, there's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us because we've already prewired those relationships. And so we're making a pretty big investment in what we call data GX, which is the aggregation layer of information, not just for State Street but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data and analytics products that sit on top of that, and I think that's when you'll really start to see some revenue momentum. So I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side. And as we get into 2017, we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you."

The -- as you point out, the GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see, and part of the synergy opportunities, which is inherent in the deal and which is likely to unfold over the next 2 or 3 quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSgA is.

Not in a point -- at this point ready to announce some additional actions, but that is an area that we're keenly focused on. And then second, obviously, if the ECB cuts further, we'd have to look harder ourselves at following at least any decrement that the ECB would make.

I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent 6 years with Citi, he was the Treasurer. But before that, I think on equivalent period, ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi and within that, also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he's -- he comes to us not just with deep financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point, Mike, the Beacon activity, well, Mike, certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what is largely centered in the operating environment. So Mike Rogers who is the President and Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity. Some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the asset servicing custody, middle office, back office. So I would see no blip in transition and would only hope that Eric, with his knowledge of this business, might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do.

But if there was a team or -- there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes that could be in scope. And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier and the data aggregation. And then more importantly, on top of that, the data and analytics business or the data and analytics opportunity, which I think is significant and is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would, if you take data and analytics and first -- and separate those 2 things, the data is the 1 part, and I think, in some respects, it's the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real-time data insights to the front office. But on top of that is analytics, whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with big data. I could see smallish acquisitions on the data and analytics side, which would take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the 2 places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see it appear on custody space, just to state the obvious."

One, I think that the regulatory hurdle would be high for the big asset servicing firms to be further concentrated in the custody business. And then I would also say that traditionally, whether it was the Deutsche Bank acquisition or IBT or even Intesa Sanpaolo, it filled the gap, Deutsche Bank in Europe, Intesa in Italy. And I don't see real gaps. If I look at our geographic coverage, we'd love to be doing more in China or in India. We're all over it. Acquisition is not likely the way to get there. Other than that, we're pretty well developed in most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets. And if you look at the -- looked at it through our product lens, Gerard, I think if you look at it all the way from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives, again, we're pretty well positioned. We think there's a meaningful opportunity in the real estate asset class, which is kind of brimming with assets to do more outsourcing there.

Second, as we talked about earlier, we've seen some outflows in terms of the hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds, but certainly, that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue. And as we've talked about previously, our AIS revenue also tends to be at a higher unit revenue per asset serviced than the other books of businesses.

And when you take your fundamental equity business at SSgA, combine it with GE and get the synergies out of that.

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.2 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date, including $212 billion in the third quarter.
We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to digitize our business to deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon, we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management.
The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well, with over 260 employees successfully onboarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSgA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities and enhances the value-add solutions to our clients.
I'll turn your attention to Slide #5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services through execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016, we continued to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breadth of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions, including: Net Asset Value Oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day; an Enhanced Asset Owner Strategy providing support to asset owner -- owners as they in-source asset management; and Enterprise Pricing Web, which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC Modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients.
In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over $500 billion.
An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client, PIMCO, to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately, in a mandate that we have won, pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting, custody, fund administration and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds, which is a high-growth market segment. State Street's industry-leading offshore fund services business and operating platform were key considerations in PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street.
In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher-yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.
Separately, our State Street Global Exchange group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it and assess impact on the price, risk and liquidity of individual assets.
We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first 3 quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax expense savings in 2016 with the full effect felt in 2017.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority, and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock.
We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities, which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
We would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in 2017, given our focus on executing our multiyear strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event, and of course, we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO, Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO of Citizens and, prior to that, spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last 6 as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking, regulation, treasury and finance to the role of CFO, which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition, and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join our team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. To you, Mike."

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.
Now I refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16, which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance.
Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably, 3Q '16 pretax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business.
On the capital front, in 3Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share, representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.
Moving to Slide 7. We're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.
Now I'll turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Management fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16, primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE Asset Management acquisition.
Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15 primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15, primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 10. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '16, primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and a small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably, expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE Asset Management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost to support new business.
I'll now move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully phased-in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE Asset Management. The September 30th fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly primarily due to the GE Asset Management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 at our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.
Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16, GE Asset Management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.
Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management.
3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.
We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015 and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur the regulatory-related expenses.
Importantly, we now expect to deliver, through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax savings for full year 2016.
Moving on to the net interest revenue, we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16 and for full year NIR to exceed the high end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.
In summary, we're pleased that the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.
And now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

The service fees were up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just the quarter. I think if you look at full year, we're up 5%, which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- we had markets mixed, IFA down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's the -- as oppose to 1%, if you look 3 quarters to date, the 5%, I think, is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning, as is typically the case, is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins, highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently, the PIMCO deal, which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets and a place that, because of Brexit and other things, I think, we'll continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of Lux and Dublin. I guess, the one other point I'd might make from a highlight standpoint is you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance. So we've seen some outflows in hedge funds. My view is that, that's more likely cyclical. I think performance recently has improved. I suspect the flows may hit back the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere, so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate, which we view as a positive situation from a standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, a little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K. on the European markets given some big deals and a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story."

Let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward in providing a more diversified and frankly, active-oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities and fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had, and I think we've nicely filled that gap. You heard from Mike's commentary the we're off to a good start with GE Asset Management. I think we're -- we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive, which still dominates the AUMs in the active business. Increasingly, we're investing, as we talked about, in ETFs, and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs, which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally but we can combine the passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter. We had good uptick and inflows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint, Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big GAAP, and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe, and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product lineup. But your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry, and I happen to think that, that -- we're probably at more the beginning of that phase in the end, but we feel pretty good with regard to the competences -- competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market globally."

And we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment just given all the uncertainty and the turbulence as a result of money market before. And we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that caused us, obviously, some NIR, but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the roll-forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really, Ashley, is mainly the story that we've talked about previously. We -- the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe, continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in -- at today. And so as a result of that grind in the rates, we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. Now there are a lot of moving parts in any given quarter, but those are really the headlines."

But as a result of accelerating some of the savings into 2016 and given just the track record that we're on right now, we think it's also a good idea to look to accelerate some of the investments. So that includes investments in IT, development spending, testing, infrastructure, all things that we believe will position us with even more confidence for 2018 and beyond savings."

I'll first take it from an asset management dimension, which maybe was the way you are initially headed. But from a fiduciary rule, the impact of that on product and distribution, I think, it leads to more model-based product. And SSgA just recently, in the last couple of weeks, announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they're using -- we've got an investment and then a Robo adviser, which we'll use the Robo adviser to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model, which, in this case, happens to be sponsored by SSgA, is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset-servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF-servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but the distributor's position us well as ETFs and other more quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say, and this is on a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect, and we're already seeing some of this, of -- from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of a full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result in end-of-day pricing for a product or a group of products, I think advantaged the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull all out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So I would say, in some, it would be on the servicing side. I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really, how product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule. And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon, the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing, will also advantage the product manufacturers who are our key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product for -- to meet the new fiduciary rule."

But if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact, particularly in the U.K., is a headwind for the rest of the year as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So as an example, the pound-based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue. We get some benefit, obviously, on the expense side of that, but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue, the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago, there continues to be some risk-off in the environment. And just even looking at some of the mix change, for example, from the outflows, from hedge funds is a mild headwind, for example, for the AIS fees. And then I looked at the S&P 500 this morning. I think it was at 2,143, and that's off from where it's been. So again, can I really view these as tweaks? Hopefully, 3 months from now, we'll look back and say it's -- it was conservative.

So we think -- given our track record, we think that's very shareholder-friendly to make those investments at that level. Round numbers, Ken, we're looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for Beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's just not huge, but it's enough to potentially move the needle. And the other piece that just continues to be a -- an area of pressure is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017, submission continues to be material. But I think if we step back from the details in your questions, I would come back to the fact that I think we've done a very good job at managing expenses overall for the full year.

The -- first, Tarullo speech in the NPR that came out that day, at this point, it is simply a proposed rule. So I think until things get finalized, I wouldn't overweight them too much. But your underlying point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous fed modeling, which had the balance sheet growing under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us because Tier 1 leverage rather than the risk-based ratios has been our binding constraint historically. So again, I don't expect that the -- that there'll be a lot of impact on the next CCAR because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 CCAR, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the risk-based capital ratios, again, would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been our binding constraint.

I mean, I would expect it would probably keep less of the benefit from the next fed fund rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to us, I think we'll probably have some modest increase on the liabilities side for our clients. But I do expect that net-net to be accretive. And first of all, it obviously helps us with our floating-rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book, which is mostly floating rate. It helps us with, obviously, the Central Bank deposits. And so all of that, I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. The other piece, just to be balanced, though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt, a significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all Grade B, but it would -- I definitely expect it to be accretive. Just to be balanced, though, that's -- your question was focused on the U.S., as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the negative impact of a portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. You want to balance that out, and obviously, as we -- when we talk beginning in January about 2017 outlook, we'll get some perspective on that."

The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards ou",491,"Sure, Brian. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, Allianz being probably the most prominent one, is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more are coming at us in a bundled way or even in the form of, and I'd say, the PIMCO and Allianz separate transactions. Both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play, and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate our middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables, we have over $10 trillion in middle office assets that we support on our technology. And like most of the activities that we conduct in the asset servicing business, scale matters. So with over $10 trillion in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit costs. We have the ability to invest disproportionately in our unit -- in our middle office platform. And so I take you back to Beacon, which is, as we ought to make and create more straight-through processing as we on the back of the middle office have updated GX aggregation product, the scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product, we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think, and I'm going to -- this is the pivot, if you go from middle office to what's the next frontier, it's who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who have committed to us to allow us to be the data aggregator, not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me, that ties directly into Beacon. But the long game here is if you can be the data aggregator, you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities. We referenced a few in my prepared comments. So I drift on your question, but I think it's a good one, which is, there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, not only more services but more value-added services as we move up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level."

And that would be, in mid-office, you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry? In other words, do you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in that business? That would be one question. And then the -- you just mentioned on data aggregation, and I guess since -- I usually ask you this at Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that, so I don't know if you can, given you're not doing an Investor Day this year, provide any sort of big picture idea about whether do you think there will be some revenue traction in 2017 from the data aggregation initiative."

I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing th",390,"Sure. So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean, what we sell is a middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value, not the price advantage. And I think that people that evaluate our middle office, they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology, usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I'd say the scale effect is, to our advantage, we work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margin. And you -- the point is obvious, but as the asset management industry is under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too, so the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective and more efficient model when we combine our customers, front office, our middle back, et cetera is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and Global Exchange, I think it's a slow-building opportunity. The -- I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute. The more you do, the better you get, the greater advantage you have, which is once we wire together, not only our digital back and middle office, but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office, there's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us because we've already prewired those relationships. And so we're making a pretty big investment in what we call data GX, which is the aggregation layer of information, not just for State Street but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data and analytics products that sit on top of that, and I think that's when you'll really start to see some revenue momentum. So I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side. And as we get into 2017, we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you."

Let me take that, Alex. The -- as you point out, the GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see, and part of the synergy opportunities, which is inherent in the deal and which is likely to unfold over the next 2 or 3 quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSgA is. But we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSgA is today, and that's part of the mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in '18 and '20. So -- and I think that at least the first couple of steps of that are well understood, and we're well on our way, and I have high confidence that we'll achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we can bring into the mix, making great progress, huge and helpful support by GE, and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this mix, which is office and CIO kind of business, which is -- just makes us bigger and more impactful on that segment."

And as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier, one of the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very low credit spreads, the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is what -- can we offset that by additional actions on the liability pricing side. And I would say, at this point, we're simply looking at various options. Not in a point -- at this point ready to announce some additional actions, but that is an area that we're keenly focused on. And then second, obviously, if the ECB cuts further, we'd have to look harder ourselves at following at least any decrement that the ECB would make.

And then Mike will transition out; Eric will be onboard. I might take this opportunity just to talk just for a minute about Eric's background. I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent 6 years with Citi, he was the Treasurer. But before that, I think on equivalent period, ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi and within that, also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he's -- he comes to us not just with deep financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point, Mike, the Beacon activity, well, Mike, certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what is largely centered in the operating environment. So Mike Rogers who is the President and Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity. Some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the asset servicing custody, middle office, back office. So I would see no blip in transition and would only hope that Eric, with his knowledge of this business, might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do. And I think to an earlier point -- and you've seen it this year, we started out with a plan for Beacon. We accelerated that plan. Nobody here is expecting the sun to shine on the environment, so we are working hard to find new opportunities in order to accelerate Beacon, expand Beacon, and I would hope that Eric would be nothing but a fresh set of eyes to see what things we might have missed."

But if there was a team or -- there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes that could be in scope. And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier and the data aggregation. And then more importantly, on top of that, the data and analytics business or the data and analytics opportunity, which I think is significant and is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would, if you take data and analytics and first -- and separate those 2 things, the data is the 1 part, and I think, in some respects, it's the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real-time data insights to the front office. But on top of that is analytics, whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with big data. I could see smallish acquisitions on the data and analytics side, which would take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the 2 places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see it appear on custody space, just to state the obvious."

And I don't see real gaps. If I look at our geographic coverage, we'd love to be doing more in China or in India. We're all over it. Acquisition is not likely the way to get there. Other than that, we're pretty well developed in most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets. And if you look at the -- looked at it through our product lens, Gerard, I think if you look at it all the way from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives, again, we're pretty well positioned.

Second, as we talked about earlier, we've seen some outflows in terms of the hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds, but certainly, that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue.

So we don't foresee although we always look at whether or not it makes sense for us to adjust fees in order to gain volume, but again, this is in the more commoditized ETFs. I think -- well, I think there'll to be pressure on those commoditized ones.

I think that if you look at the GE Asset Management deal, whenever you combined 2 asset management deals, you'd expect a fair amount of synergy in the core corporate support kind of activities, and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSgA, mainly the alternatives, there were some alternatives at SSgA and maybe more importantly,, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement, we announced a reorganization, which brought those groups together. So there's a fair amount of synergy just tied up. And when you take your fundamental equity business at SSgA, combine it with GE and get the synergies out of that. So I would say it's in the corporate support areas and also in the different asset classes where, in many cases, SSgA had some capabilities just not as robust as the GE Asset Management.
Would you add anything to that, Mike?"

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.2 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date, including $212 billion in the third quarter.
We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to digitize our business to deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon, we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management.
The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well, with over 260 employees successfully onboarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSgA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities and enhances the value-add solutions to our clients.
I'll turn your attention to Slide #5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services through execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016, we continued to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breadth of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions, including: Net Asset Value Oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day; an Enhanced Asset Owner Strategy providing support to asset owner -- owners as they in-source asset management; and Enterprise Pricing Web, which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC Modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients.
In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over $500 billion.
An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client, PIMCO, to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately, in a mandate that we have won, pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting, custody, fund administration and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds, which is a high-growth market segment. State Street's industry-leading offshore fund services business and operating platform were key considerations in PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street.
In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher-yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.
Separately, our State Street Global Exchange group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it and assess impact on the price, risk and liquidity of individual assets.
We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first 3 quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax expense savings in 2016 with the full effect felt in 2017.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority, and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock.
We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities, which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.
We would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting an Investor Day in 2017, given our focus on executing our multiyear strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event, and of course, we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO, Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO of Citizens and, prior to that, spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last 6 as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking, regulation, treasury and finance to the role of CFO, which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition, and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join our team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. To you, Mike."

This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include 2 notable items. First one, July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.
Now I refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16, which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance.
Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably, 3Q '16 pretax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business.
On the capital front, in 3Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share, representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.
Moving to Slide 7. We're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.
Now I'll turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Management fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16, primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE Asset Management acquisition.
Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15 primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15, primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.
Moving to Slide 10. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q '16, primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and a small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably, expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE Asset Management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost to support new business.
I'll now move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully phased-in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE Asset Management. The September 30th fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly primarily due to the GE Asset Management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 at our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.
Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16, GE Asset Management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.
Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management.
3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.
We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015 and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur the regulatory-related expenses.
Importantly, we now expect to deliver, through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least $165 million in estimated annual pretax savings for full year 2016.
Moving on to the net interest revenue, we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16 and for full year NIR to exceed the high end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.
In summary, we're pleased that the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.
And now let me turn the call back over to Jay."

The service fees were up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just the quarter. I think if you look at full year, we're up 5%, which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- we had markets mixed, IFA down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's the -- as oppose to 1%, if you look 3 quarters to date, the 5%, I think, is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning, as is typically the case, is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins, highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently, the PIMCO deal, which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets and a place that, because of Brexit and other things, I think, we'll continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of Lux and Dublin. I guess, the one other point I might make from a highlight standpoint is you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance. So we've seen some outflows in hedge funds. My view is that, that's more likely cyclical. I think performance recently has improved. I suspect the flows may hit back the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere, so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate, which we view as a positive situation from a standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, a little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K. on the European markets given some big deals and a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story."

So that wa",347,"Yes, Ashley. Let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward in providing a more diversified and frankly, active-oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities and fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had, and I think we've nicely filled that gap. You heard from Mike's commentary that we're off to a good start with GE Asset Management. I think we're -- we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive, which still dominates the AUMs in the active business. Increasingly, we're investing, as we talked about, in ETFs, and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs, which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally but we can combine the passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter. We had good uptick and inflows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint, Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big GAAP, and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe, and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product lineup. But your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry, and I happen to think that, that -- we're probably at more the beginning of that phase in the end, but we feel pretty good with regard to the competences -- competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market globally."

So Ashley, first, in terms of the wholesale funding, we did expand our use of wholesale funding in 3Q relative to 2Q by approximately $2.5 billion. And we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment just given all the uncertainty and the turbulence as a result of money market before. And we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that caused us, obviously, some NIR, but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the roll-forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really, Ashley, is mainly the story that we've talked about previously. We -- the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe, continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in -- at today. And so as a result of that grind in the rates, we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q.

I'll first take it from an asset management dimension, which maybe was the way you are initially headed. But from a fiduciary rule, the impact of that on product and distribution, I think, it leads to more model-based product. And SSgA just recently, in the last couple of weeks, announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they're using -- we've got an investment and then a Robo adviser, which we'll use the Robo adviser to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model, which, in this case, happens to be sponsored by SSgA, is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset-servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF-servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but the distributor's position us well as ETFs and other more quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say, and this is on a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect, and we're already seeing some of this, of -- from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of a full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result in end-of-day pricing for a product or a group of products, I think advantaged the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull all out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So I would say, in some, it would be on the servicing side. I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really, how product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule. And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon, the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing, will also advantage the product manufacturers who are our key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product for -- to meet the new fiduciary rule."

But if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact, particularly in the U.K., is a headwind for the rest of the year as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So as an example, the pound-based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue. We get some benefit, obviously, on the expense side of that, but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue, the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago, there continues to be some risk-off in the environment. And just even looking at some of the mix change, for example, from the outflows, from hedge funds is a mild headwind, for example, for the AIS fees. And then I looked at the S&P 500 this morning. I think it was at 2,143, and that's off from where it's been. So again, can I really view these as tweaks? Hopefully, 3 months from now, we'll look back and say it's -- it was conservative.

So we think -- given our track record, we think that's very shareholder-friendly to make those investments at that level. Round numbers, Ken, we're looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for Beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's just not huge, but it's enough to potentially move the needle. And the other piece that just continues to be a -- an area of pressure is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017, submission continues to be material.

So again, I don't expect that the -- that there'll be a lot of impact on the next CCAR because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 CCAR, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the risk-based capital ratios, again, would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been our binding constraint.

It helps us with, obviously, the Central Bank deposits. And so all of that, I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. The other piece, just to be balanced, though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt, a significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all Grade B, but it would -- I definitely expect it to be accretive. Just to be balanced, though, that's -- your question was focused on the U.S., as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the negative impact of a portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates and also depressed spreads because of QE over there.

If you could sort of differentiate yourself in this space and talk about whether you think there's change in the growth outlook and in pricing dynamics in mid-office."

The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards ou",491,"Sure, Brian. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. As there's more pressure on returns, which translates into a more downward pressure on the asset management industry, there's been an acceleration, I'd call it, in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, Allianz being probably the most prominent one, is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more are coming at us in a bundled way or even in the form of, and I'd say, the PIMCO and Allianz separate transactions. Both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play, and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate our middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables, we have over $10 trillion in middle office assets that we support on our technology. And like most of the activities that we conduct in the asset servicing business, scale matters. So with over $10 trillion in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit costs. We have the ability to invest disproportionately in our unit -- in our middle office platform. And so I take you back to Beacon, which is, as we ought to make and create more straight-through processing as we on the back of the middle office have updated GX aggregation product, the scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product, we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think, and I'm going to -- this is the pivot, if you go from middle office to what's the next frontier, it's who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who have committed to us to allow us to be the data aggregator, not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me, that ties directly into Beacon. But the long game here is if you can be the data aggregator, you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities. We referenced a few in my prepared comments. So I drift on your question, but I think it's a good one, which is, there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, not only more services but more value-added services as we move up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level."

And that would be, in mid-office, you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry? In other words, do you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in that business? That would be one question. And then the -- you just mentioned on data aggregation, and I guess since -- I usually ask you this at Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that, so I don't know if you can, given you're not doing an Investor Day this year, provide any sort of big picture idea about whether do you think there will be some revenue traction in 2017 from the data aggregation initiative."

I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing th",390,"Sure. So let me take the first one first, middle office pricing scale effect margin question. I think that I'm convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit costs to perform in the middle office. We've done a good job at standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean, what we sell is a middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value, not the price advantage. And I think that people that evaluate our middle office, they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology, usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I'd say the scale effect is, to our advantage, we work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margin. And you -- the point is obvious, but as the asset management industry is under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too, so the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective and more efficient model when we combine our customers, front office, our middle back, et cetera is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and Global Exchange, I think it's a slow-building opportunity. The -- I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute. The more you do, the better you get, the greater advantage you have, which is once we wire together, not only our digital back and middle office, but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office, there's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us because we've already prewired those relationships. And so we're making a pretty big investment in what we call data GX, which is the aggregation layer of information, not just for State Street but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data and analytics products that sit on top of that, and I think that's when you'll really start to see some revenue momentum. So I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side. And as we get into 2017, we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you."

Let me take that, Alex. The -- as you point out, the GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see, and part of the synergy opportunities, which is inherent in the deal and which is likely to unfold over the next 2 or 3 quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSgA is. But we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSgA is today, and that's part of the mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in '18 and '20. So -- and I think that at least the first couple of steps of that are well understood, and we're well on our way, and I have high confidence that we'll achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we can bring into the mix, making great progress, huge and helpful support by GE, and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this mix, which is office and CIO kind of business, which is -- just makes us bigger and more impactful on that segment."

And as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier, one of the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover, particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very low credit spreads, the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is what -- can we offset that by additional actions on the liability pricing side. And I would say, at this point, we're simply looking at various options. Not in a point -- at this point ready to announce some additional actions, but that is an area that we're keenly focused on. And then second, obviously, if the ECB cuts further, we'd have to look harder ourselves at following at least any decrement that the ECB would make.

And then Mike will transition out; Eric will be onboard. I might take this opportunity just to talk just for a minute about Eric's background. I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent 6 years with Citi, he was the Treasurer. But before that, I think on equivalent period, ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi and within that, also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he's -- he comes to us not just with deep financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point, Mike, the Beacon activity, well, Mike, certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what is largely centered in the operating environment. So Mike Rogers who is the President and Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity. Some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the asset servicing custody, middle office, back office. So I would see no blip in transition and would only hope that Eric, with his knowledge of this business, might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do.

But if there was a team or -- there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes that could be in scope. And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier and the data aggregation. And then more importantly, on top of that, the data and analytics business or the data and analytics opportunity, which I think is significant and is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would, if you take data and analytics and first -- and separate those 2 things, the data is the 1 part, and I think, in some respects, it's the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real-time data insights to the front office. But on top of that is analytics, whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with big data. I could see smallish acquisitions on the data and analytics side, which would take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the 2 places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see it appear on custody space, just to state the obvious."

Other than that, we're pretty well developed in most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets. And if you look at the -- looked at it through our product lens, Gerard, I think if you look at it all the way from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives, again, we're pretty well positioned.

We've -- we have a yield on that block currently of approximately 3.7%, so it's an attractive book. And at this point, if we had, knock on wood, a very good credit experience out there, so I feel like we're doing a good job of underwriting and managing the credits there. Right, I'd really wouldn't put, at this point, Gerard, a long-term expectation out there. Again, I would expect to beat the overall portfolio averages given our credit underwriting and our bias towards being at the higher end of the scale. So at this point, I really wouldn't try to put a long-term estimate on it. But it's something that we'll continue to manage, and we're very sensitive to the changes in the credit cycle."

And even if I adjust that for the FX fee revenue, let's assume we give all of that hit to servicing, it's basically flattish year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15. And I'm comparing that with your AUCA 3Q '16, also 3Q '15, that is up 7%. And in fact, if I do a similar rough FX adjustment, probably up 8%.

Number one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016 relative to 2015. We've talked about this on prior calls. We've seen, for example, more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the U.S. And so basically, the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets, for example, to the developed markets, particularly the U.S., has a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there. Second, as we talked about earlier, we've seen some outflows in terms of the hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds, but certainly, that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue. And as we've talked about previously, our AIS revenue also tends to be at a higher unit revenue per asset serviced than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for currency and markets, that really is the story. All the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios relative to assets. Because that -- the -- all the factors that I just mentioned play havoc with those ratios, particularly if you're looking at it in a short-term period."

I think that if you look at the GE Asset Management deal, whenever you combined 2 asset management deals, you'd expect a fair amount of synergy in the core corporate support kind of activities, and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSgA, mainly the alternatives, there were some alternatives at SSgA and maybe more importantly,, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement, we announced a reorganization, which brought those groups together. So there's a fair amount of synergy just tied up. And when you take your fundamental equity business at SSgA, combine it with GE and get the synergies out of that. So I would say it's in the corporate support areas and also in the different asset classes where, in many cases, SSgA had some capabilities just not as robust as the GE Asset Management.
Would you add anything to that, Mike?"
