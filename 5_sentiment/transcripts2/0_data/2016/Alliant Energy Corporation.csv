I will begin with an overview of 2015 performance and provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I will also show the progress to date and transforming our generation fleet, modernizing our electric system and expanding of our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance, as well as review of regulatory calendar.
I'm pleased to report we have noticed a solid year achieving a $3.57 midpoint of our November 2015 guidance range when adding back the negative temperature impact of $0.08 per share to the non-GAAP earnings of $3.49 per share. Our 2015 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings reflect an increase of over 5% from comparable 2014 earnings as shown on Slide 2.
The temperatures late 2015 did impact our actual year-end results. For the first 10 months of 2015, our financial results were basically temperature neutral. Of the 1 winter, we experienced especially in December resulted in a negative $0.08 per share variance in 2015 earnings. This was quite the opposite for 2014, we experienced a $0.09 positive variance to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings could lead to a significant year-over-year variance of $0.17 per share.
We also issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2016 to 2019 totaling $5 billion as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plans to our current plan on Slide 4.
As you can see, the $260 million increase in our forecasted 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily from accelerated investment and our electric and gas distribution systems. The December 2015 extension of bonus depreciation for certain announcement 2019 has given us the opportunity to bring forward some infrastructure projects that will benefit our customers for years to come.
I do want to point out that with this revised capital plan, we expect no material change to the rate base forecast that we provided last November for IPL and WPLs through 2018. We anticipate the increase in forecasted capital expenditures will offset the impact resulted in the extension of bonus depreciation.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the transition of our generation fleet in an economical manner to serve our customers. We've made significant progress and building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greatest fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition included installing emission control, performance upgrade at our largest coal fire facilities less efficient coal units and increasing levels of natural gas and renewable energy generation. Since 2010, Alliant Energy has retired a 1150 megawatts of coal-fired generation or about 1/3 of our 2009 coal capacity.
These retirements have been replaced with highly efficient gas-fired generation, which produces approximately half of the carbon emissions when compares to coal-fired generation.
Natural gas prices in 2015 resulted in significant changes to the capacity factors of our gas units. Riverside had an approximately 50% capacity factor last year, more than double its prior 5-year average. Our facility also experienced significant increase in operating during 2015. 
With lower gas prices, the additional gas generation in our portfolio resulted in savings for our customers in 2015.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2015 was again a very active construction year with over $1 billion deployed. Our investments included approximately $360 million for electric and gas distribution systems. This was one of the largest annual investments in those systems and will be an area of billing investments. These projects have driven by customer expectations to make our electric system more reliable and resilient and to expand natural gas services especially to communities excess before.
In Iowa, Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well, and is now approximately 75% complete. Forecast capital expenditure for this project are approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service 2017. In Wisconsin, progress continues on the installation of back half at Edgewater Unit 5. This project is approximately 90% complete and is on time and below budget. Capital expenditure forecast for this project are approximately $270 million and is expected to be in service later this year.
and replacement work continues at Columbia and these performance improvement projects are expected to completed next year. This construction of a Columbia Unit 2 SCR will begin. WP&L capital expenditure for this project is approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. In 2013, WPL announced that entire several older coal facilities and natural gas peaking units. And after more than 50 years of dependable operation, Nelson Dewey and Edgewater Unit rates were retired in December. The retirement of these units or several other retirements 2019 will result in a reduction of WPL's capacity of approximately 700 megawatts. As a result, WPL propose to construct 700 megawatt highly efficient natural gas generating facility referred to as a Riverside Energy Center expansion. We anticipate the Public Service Commission will issue its decision on the Riverside expansion in the second quarter.
Earlier this month, we announced that we had negotiated options with neighboring utilities and electric cooperative partial Riverside ownership of up to 55 megawatts during the construction facility and up to an additional 250 megawatts during the first 5 years of the facility is operating.
With this agreement, the cooperative have expanded the wholesale electric contract with WP&L by 4 years to 2026. We're pleased that our neighbor utilities realize the benefits of our proposed facilities and want to be involved in this exciting and innovative project. While we now expect the output from the Riverside unit to be close to 700 megawatts, the capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC  and transmission. The targeted in-service base has changed from early 2019 to early 2020. Therefore, the timing of the capital expenditures have been updated and are reflected on Slide 3 based on input from the EPC bidders. The expenditures presented for Riverside do not reflect a possible capital reduction cooperative exercise of 55 megawatts purchase option during construction.
In addition to the Riverside joint ownership option, hub service and will have the options to limit their capital expenditures at Columbia to paying for only the SCR during the time at Riverside is being constructed. Our capital expenditure plan does not reflect this option being executed. However, we expect that any increase in our capital expenditures at Columbia with these largely offset the electric costs exercise purchase option 55 megawatts of Riverside.
Earlier this month, United States Supreme Court effectively delayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the EPS rules are resolved. The state will not change our current resource of capital expenditure plan as they were not based on compliance with the Clean Power Plan. As we plan for our future generation needs, we aimed to minimize emissions providing safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We believe that with the transition of our generation fleet and the availability of lower natural gas prices, our carbon emissions will continues to decrease.
We're very fortunate to operate in states that have long history of support renewable energy and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. We had and we will continue to invest and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation and our capital plan include additional investments to customer energy needs. In addition, we currently purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Wind energy provided approximately 8% of our customers energy needs in 2015.
Also we have several solar projects under development from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on integrate solar in a cost effective manner into our electric system. 
At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed and generating power for the building. Construction is also started on Wisconsin's largest on rock river land, which is adjacent to Riverside. 
In Iowa, we're the only operating solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids and are responses to the ARPU we issued for additional solar in our portfolio.
There is a sense of excitement as we worked to transform the company to meet our customers evolving expectations. A major improvement to our customer experience just happened as we went live with our new customer care and billing system. This $110 million investment replaced main frame systems from the 1980s. Our new billing system will make communication with our customers more convenient and timely and allow for us to provide innovative service options. This project was another well executed major initiative. I do want to thank everyone that worked so hard for years to transform our customer experience.
At Alliant Energy, we've already made great progress to transitioning our utilities to a cleaner more modern energy system. These wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees who keep the customer at the center of everything we do. 
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2015 and we'll work hard to also deliver 2016 financial and operating objectives. We anticipate no material change for the rate base growth for 2018 as the updated capital expenditure plan will offset any impact from the extension of bonus depreciation. Our plan countries to provide 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend target.
Successful execution on our major construction project includes completing project on time and below budget in a very safe manner. Working with regulators, consumer environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Reshaping our organization to be leaner and faster or keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.0",1019,"Good morning, everyone. We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the sale of IPL Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and a $0.04 per share charge resulting from the approximately 2% of employees accepting voluntary separation packages as we continued focusing on matching cost for our customers. Comparison between 2015 and 2014 earnings per share are detailed on slides 5, 6 and 7.
Retail, electric, temperature and normalized sales increased approximately 1% or $0.04 per share at IPL, WP&L between 2015 and 2014. This excludes the impact of the Minnesota sales. The industrial segment continues to be the largest sales growth driver year-over-year. For 2015 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision from expected to lower ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. We reserve $0.06 per share for 2015, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.82%. This is the result of the administrative judges initial decision issued in December 2015. 
Now, let's review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater 5 and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station. 
The 2016 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail electric sales increases of approximately 1% for IPL and WP&L excluding the impacts of Minnesota sale. Also the earnings guidance is based upon the impacts of IPL and WP&L previously announced retail electric base rate settlements. The IPL settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from Lansing in-service in 2015. In 2016 IPL expects the credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credit in 2015 were $24 million. During 2016, IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credit to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated to impact full year results.
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater 5 scrubber in house projected to be placed in service in 2016. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.
Also included in WP&L's rate settlement was an increase in transmission cost, primarily related to the anticipated allocation of SSR cost. As a result of FERC order issued after the settlement, the amount of transmission costs billed to WP&L in 2016 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement, since the PSCW approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission cost, the difference between the actual transmission cost billed to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement has been accumulated in a regulatory liability. We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance approximately $35 million by the end of 2016. This regulatory liability is another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin, retail electric customers.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC for 2016 and provide you the actual effective tax rates for 2015. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current financing forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deductions for certain capital expenditures for property through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is built upon the current federal net operating losses and the credit carryforward position as well as future bonus depreciation expected to be taken federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we'll maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit ratings. Our 2016 financing plan assumes will be issued approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plans also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL, and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy resources. $310 million of proceeds and the parent and Alliant Energy resources are expected to be used to refinance maturity of term loans. We may adjust our financing plans as deem prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the proposed Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018 would be financed primarily by a combination of that and new common equity. Before the five-year extension bonus depreciation, we were not expected to make any material federal income tax payments through 2017. Does the extension of bonus depreciation is not expected to change our financial needs for the next 2 years.
We have several current and planned dignitary dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarize on Slide 9. During the second quarter of 2016, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW on the Riverside expansion proposals, and we anticipate a W P&L retail electric and gas case for 2017 and 2018 rates. IPL will be filing our five-year mission plan and budget in the first quarter expected decision regarding the application for the approximately $50 million equipment natural gas pipeline in the second quarter. The makes Iowa retail electric and gas bit race cases are expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2017. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the coming year.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date",1772,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date in transforming our generation fleet, modernizing our electric system and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance as well as a review of our regulatory calendar.
I'm pleased to report we've had another solid year, achieving a $3.57 midpoint of our November 2015 guidance range when adding back the negative temperature impact of $0.08 per share to the non-GAAP earnings of $3.49 per share. Our 2015 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings reflect an increase of over 5% from comparable 2014 earnings, as shown on Slide 2.
The temperatures in late 2015 did impact our actual year-end results. For the first 10 months of 2015, our financial results were basically temperature-neutral. But the one winter we experienced, especially in December, resulted in a negative $0.08 per share variance in 2015 earnings. This was quite the opposite for 2014, where we experienced a $0.09 per share positive variance to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings did lead to a significant year-over-year variance of $0.17 per share.
We also issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2016 to 2019 totaling $5 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the $260 million increase in our forecasted 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily from accelerated investments in our electric and gas distribution systems. The December 2015 extension of bonus depreciation for certain announcement through 2019 has given us the opportunity to bring forward some infrastructure projects that will benefit our customers for years to come.
I do want to point out that with this revised capital plan, we expect no material change to the rate base forecast that we provided last November for IPL and WPL through 2018. We anticipate the increase in forecasted capital expenditures will offset the impact resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generation fleet in an economical manner to serve our customers. We've made significant progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greatest fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition included installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities, retiring older, less efficient coal units and increasing levels of natural gas-fired and renewable energy generation. Since 2010, Alliant Energy has retired or repowered over 1,150 megawatts of coal-fired generation or about 1/3 of our 2009 coal nameplate capacity.  These retirements have been replaced with highly efficient gas-fired generation, which produces approximately half of the carbon emissions when compared to coal-fired generation.
Low natural gas prices in 2015 resulted in significant changes to the capacity factors of our gas units. Riverside had an approximately 50% capacity factor last year, more than double its prior 5-year average. Our Emery combined cycle facility also experienced significant increase in operating hours during 2015. With lower gas prices, the additional gas generation in our portfolio resulted in savings for our customers in 2015.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2015 was again a very active construction year with over $1 billion deployed. Our investments included approximately $360 million for electric and gas distribution systems. This was one of the largest annual investments in those systems and will be an area of drilling investments. These projects are driven by customer expectations to make our electric system more reliable and resilient and to expand natural gas services, especially to communities that did not have access before.
In Iowa, Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well, and it is now approximately 75% complete. Forecasted capital expenditure for this project are approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
In Wisconsin, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5. This project is approximately 90% complete and is on time and below budget. Capital expenditure forecast for this project are approximately $270 million and is expected to be in service later this year.
Turbine upgrades and pulverizer replacement work continues at Columbia, and these performance improvements projects are expected to be completed next year. This spring, construction of a Columbia Unit 2 SCR will begin. WPL's capital expenditure for this project is approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. In 2013, WPL announced that it will retire several older coal facilities and natural gas peaking units. And after more than 50 years of dependable operation, Nelson Dewey and Edgewater Unit 3 were retired in December. The retirement of these units or several other retirements through 2019 will result in a reduction of WPL capacity of approximately 700 megawatts. As a result, WPL proposed to construct the 700-megawatt highly efficient natural gas generating facility referred to as a Riverside Energy Center expansion. We anticipate the Public Service Commission will issue its decision on the Riverside expansion in the second quarter.
Earlier this month, we announced that we had negotiated options with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives for partial Riverside ownership of up to 55 megawatts during the construction of the facility and up to an additional 250 megawatts during the first 5 years that the facility is operating. With this agreement, the cooperatives have extended their wholesale electric contract with WP&L by 4 years through 2026. We are pleased that our neighbor utilities realize the benefits of our proposed facility and want to be involved in this exciting and innovative project. 
While we now expect the output from the Riverside units to be close to 700 megawatts, the capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC  and transmission. The targeted in-service date has changed from early 2019 to early 2020. Therefore, the timing of the capital expenditures have been updated and are reflected on Slide 3 based on input from the EPC bidders. The expenditures presented for Riverside do not reflect a possible capital reduction if the cooperatives exercise their 55-megawatt purchase option during construction.
In addition to the Riverside joint ownership option, hub service and MG&E will have the option to limit their capital expenditures at Columbia to paying for only the SCR during the time that Riverside is being constructed. Our capital expenditure plan does not reflect this option being executed; however, we expect that any increase in our capital expenditures at Columbia would be largely offset if the electric co-ops exercise their purchase option of 55 megawatts of Riverside.
Earlier this month, United States Supreme Court effectively delayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the EPS rules are resolved. This stay will not change our current resource or capital expenditure plan as they were not based on compliance with the Clean Power Plan. As we plan for our future generation needs, we aim to minimize the emissions while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We believe that with the transition of our generation fleet and the availability of lower natural gas prices, our carbon emissions will continue to decrease.
We're very fortunate to operate in states that have had a long history of support for renewable energy and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation, and our 10-year capital plan includes additional investments to the customer energy needs. In addition, we currently purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Wind energy provided approximately 8% of our customers energy needs in 2015.
Also we have several solar projects under development from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they're now generating power for the building. Construction is also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. And in Iowa, we're the only operating the solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids and are reviewing responses to the RFP we issued for additional solar in our portfolio.
There is a sense of excitement as we work to transform the company to meet our customers' evolving expectations. A major improvement to our customer experience just happened as we went live with our new customer care and billing system. This $110 million investment replaced mainframe systems from the 1980s. Our new billing system will make communication with our customers more convenient and timely and allow for us to provide innovative service options. This project was another well-executed major initiative, and I do want to thank everyone that worked so hard for years to transform our customer experience. At Alliant Energy, we've already made great progress to transitioning our utilities to a cleaner, more modern energy system. This would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees who keep the customer at the center of everything we do. 
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2015, and we'll work hard to also deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. We anticipate no material change for the rate base growth through 2018 as the updated capital expenditure plan will offset any impact from the extension of bonus depreciation. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend target.
Successful execution on our major construction project includes completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; working with regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; reshaping our organization to be leaner and faster or keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.0",1038,"Good morning, everyone. We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the sale of IPL's Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and a $0.04 per share charge resulting from the approximately 2% of employees accepting voluntary separation packages as we continued focusing on matching cost for our customers. Comparisons between 2015 and 2014 earnings per share are detailed on slides 5, 6 and 7.
Retail electric temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% or $0.04 per share at IPL and WP&L between 2015 and 2014. This excludes the impacts of the Minnesota sale. The industrial segment continues to be the largest sales growth driver year-over-year. The 2015 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision from FERC expected to lower ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. We reserved $0.06 per share for 2015, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.82%. This is a result of the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision issued in December 2015. 
Now let's review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater 5 and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station. 
The 2016 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail electric sales increases of approximately 1% for IPL and WP&L, excluding the impact of Minnesota sale. Also, the earnings guidance is based on the impacts of IPL and WP&L's previously announced retail electric base rate settlements. The IPL settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from financing the Lansing scrubber in service in 2015. In 2016, IPL expects the credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. During 2016, IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results.
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse projected to be placed in service in 2016. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.
Also included in WP&L's rate settlement was an increase in transmission cost primarily related to the anticipated allocation of SSR cost. As a result of a FERC order issued after the settlement, the amount of transmission cost billed to WP&L in 2016 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement. Since the PSCW approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission cost, the difference between the actual transmission cost billed to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement has been accumulated in a regulatory liability. We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance of approximately $35 million by the end of 2016. This regulatory liability is another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin retail electric customers.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC for 2016 and provide you the actual effective tax rates for 2015. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current financing forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deductions for certain capital expenditures for property through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based upon the current federal net operating losses and the credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit ratings. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plans also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance maturity of term loans. We may adjust our financing plans as deem prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the proposed Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Before the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, we were not expected to make any material federal income tax payments through 2017. Thus, the extension of the bonus depreciation is not expected to change our financial needs for the next 2 years.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. During the second quarter of 2016, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW on the Riverside expansion proposal, and we anticipate filling a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we'll be filing our 5-year emission plan and budget in the first quarter and expect a decision regarding the application for the approximately $50 million Clinton natural gas pipeline in the second quarter. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2017. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the coming year.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date",1769,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date in transforming our generation fleet, modernizing our electric system and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance as well as review our regulatory calendar.
I'm pleased to report we've had another solid year, achieving a $3.57 midpoint of our November 2015 guidance range when adding back the negative temperature impact of $0.08 per share to the non-GAAP earnings of $3.49 per share. Our 2015 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings reflect an increase of over 5% from comparable 2014 earnings, as shown on Slide 2.
The temperatures in late 2015 did impact our actual year-end results. For the first 10 months of 2015, our financial results were basically temperature-neutral. But the one winter we experienced, especially in December, resulted in a negative $0.08 per share variance in 2015 earnings. This was quite the opposite for 2014; we experienced a $0.09 per share positive variance to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings did lead to a significant year-over-year variance of $0.17 per share.
We also issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2016 to 2019 totaling $5 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the $260 million increase in our forecasted 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily from accelerated investments in our electric and gas distribution systems. The December 2015 extension of bonus depreciation for certain investments through 2019 has given us the opportunity to bring forward some infrastructure projects that will benefit our customers for years to come.
I do want to point out that with this revised capital plan, we expect no material change to the rate base forecast that we provided last November for IPL and WPL through 2018. We anticipate the increase in forecasted capital expenditures will offset the impact resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generation fleet in an economical manner to serve our customers. We've made significant progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition included installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities, retiring older, less efficient coal units and increasing levels of natural gas-fired and renewable energy generation. 
Since 2010, Alliant Energy has retired or repowered over 1,150 megawatts of coal-fired generation or about 1/3 of our 2009 coal nameplate capacity.  These retirements have been replaced with highly efficient gas-fired generation, which produces approximately half of the carbon emissions when compared to coal-fired generation.
Low natural gas prices in 2015 resulted in significant changes to the capacity factors of our gas units. Riverside had an approximately 50% capacity factor last year, more than double its prior 5-year average. Our Emery combined cycle facility also experienced significant increase in operating hours during 2015. With lower gas prices, the additional gas generation in our portfolio resulted in savings for our customers in 2015.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2015 was again a very active construction year with over $1 billion deployed. Our investments included approximately $360 million for electric and gas distribution systems. This was one of the largest annual investments in those systems and will be an area of drilling investments. These projects are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more reliable and resilient and to expand natural gas services, especially to communities that did not have access before.
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well, and it is now approximately 75% complete. Forecasted capital expenditure for this project are approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
In Wisconsin, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5. This project is approximately 90% complete and is on time and below budget. Capital expenditure forecasts for this project are approximately $270 million, and it is expected to be in service later this year.
Turbine upgrades and pulverizer replacement work continues at Columbia, and these performance improvements projects are expected to be completed next year. This spring, construction of a Columbia Unit 2 SCR will begin. WPL's capital expenditure for this project is approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. In 2013, WPL announced that it will retire several older coal facilities and natural gas peaking units. And after more than 50 years of dependable operation, Nelson Dewey and Edgewater Unit 3 were retired in December. The retirement of these units plus  several other retirements through 2019 will result in a reduction of WPL capacity of approximately 700 megawatts. As a result, WPL proposed to construct the 700-megawatt highly-efficient natural gas generating facility referred to as the Riverside Energy Center expansion. We anticipate the Public Service Commission will issue its decision on the Riverside expansion in the second quarter.
Earlier this month, we announced that we had negotiated options with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives for partial Riverside ownership of up to 55 megawatts during the construction of the facility and up to an additional 250 megawatts during the first 5 years that the facility is operating. With this agreement, the cooperatives have extended their wholesale electric contract with WP&L by 4 years through 2026. We are pleased that our neighbor utilities realize the benefits of our proposed facility and want to be involved in this exciting and innovative project. 
While we now expect the output from the Riverside units to be close to 700 megawatts, the capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC  and transmission. The targeted in-service date has changed from early 2019 to early 2020. Therefore, the timing of the capital expenditures have been updated and are reflected on Slide 3 based on input from the EPC bidders. The expenditures presented for Riverside do not reflect a possible capital reduction if the cooperatives exercise their 55-megawatt purchase options during construction.
In addition to the Riverside joint ownership option, hub [ph] service and MG&E will have the options to limit their capital expenditures at Columbia to paying for only the SCR during the time that Riverside is being constructed. Our capital expenditure plan does not reflect this option being executed; however, we expect that any increase in our capital expenditures at Columbia would be largely offset if the electric co-ops exercise their purchase option of 55 megawatts of Riverside.
Earlier this month, United States Supreme Court effectively delayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the EPS rules are resolved. This stay will not change our current resource or capital expenditure plan as they were not based on compliance with the Clean Power Plan. As we plan for our future generation needs, we aim to minimize the emissions while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We believe that with the transition of our generation fleet and the availability of lower natural gas prices, our carbon emissions will continue to decrease.
We're very fortunate to operate in states that have had a long history of support for renewable energy and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation, and our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to meet customer energy needs. In addition, we currently purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Wind energy provided approximately 8% of our customers' energy needs in 2015.
Also, we have several solar projects under development from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they're now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. And in Iowa, we'll be owning and operating the solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids and are reviewing responses to the RFP we issued for additional solar in our portfolio.
There is a sense of excitement as we work to transform the company to meet our customers' evolving expectations. A major improvement to our customer experience just happened as we went live with our new customer care and billing system. This $110 million investment replaced mainframe systems from the 1980s. Our new billing system will make communication with our customers more convenient and timely and allow for us to provide innovative service options. This project was another well-executed major initiative. I do want to thank everyone that worked so hard for years to transform our customer experience. At Alliant Energy, we've already made great progress  transitioning our utilities to a cleaner, more modern energy system. This would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees who keep the customer at the center of everything we do. 
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2015, and we'll work hard to also deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. We anticipate no material change for the rate-based growth through 2018 as the updated capital expenditure plan will offset any impact from the extension of bonus depreciation. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend target.
Successful execution on our major construction project includes completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; reshaping our organization to be leaner and faster while keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.0",1040,"Good morning, everyone. We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the sale of IPL's Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and a $0.04 per share charge resulting from the approximately 2% of employees accepting voluntary separation packages as we continue  focusing on matching cost for our customers. Comparisons between 2015 and 2014 earnings per share are detailed on slides 5, 6 and 7.
Retail electric temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% or $0.04 per share at IPL and WP&L between 2015 and 2014. This excludes the impacts of the Minnesota sale. The industrial segment continues to be the largest sales growth driver year-over-year. The 2015 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision from FERC expected to lower ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. We reserved $0.06 per share for 2015, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.82%. This is a result of the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision issued in December 2015. 
Now let's review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater 5 and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station. 
The 2016 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail electric sales increases of approximately 1% for IPL and WP&L, excluding the impacts of the Minnesota sale. Also, the earnings guidance is based on the impacts of IPL and WP&L's previously announced retail electric base rate settlements. The IPL settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from financing the Lansing scrubber in service in 2015. In 2016, IPL expects the credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. During 2016, IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results.
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse projected to be placed in service in 2016. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.
Also included in WP&L's rate settlement was an increase in transmission cost, primarily related to the anticipated allocation of SSR cost. As a result of a FERC order issued after the settlement, the amount of transmission cost billed to WP&L in 2016 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement. Since the PSCW approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission cost, the difference between the actual transmission cost billed to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement has been accumulated in a regulatory liability. We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance of approximately $35 million by the end of 2016. This regulatory liability is another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin retail electric customers.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC for 2016 and provide you the actual effective tax rates for 2015. 
Turning to our financing plan. Our current financing forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deductions for certain capital expenditures for property through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based upon the current federal net operating losses and the credit carryforward position as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit ratings. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plans also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance maturity of term loans. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the proposed Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Before the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, we were not expected to make any material federal income tax payments through 2017. Thus, the extension of the bonus depreciation is not expected to change our financing needs for the next 2 years.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. During the second quarter of 2016, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW on the Riverside expansion proposal, and we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we'll be filing our 5-year emission plan and budget in the first quarter and expect a decision regarding the permit  application for the approximately $60 million Clinton natural gas pipeline in the second quarter. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2017. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the coming year. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date",1768,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our year-end earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecast capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress to date in transforming our generation fleet, modernizing our electric system and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance as well as review our regulatory calendar.
I'm pleased to report we've had another solid year, achieving a $3.57 midpoint of our November 2015 guidance range when adding back the negative temperature impact of $0.08 per share to the non-GAAP earnings of $3.49 per share. Our 2015 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings reflect an increase of over 5% from comparable 2014 earnings, as shown on Slide 2.
The temperatures in late 2015 did impact our actual year-end results. For the first 10 months of 2015, our financial results were basically temperature-neutral. But the one winter we experienced, especially in December, resulted in a negative $0.08 per share variance in 2015 earnings. This was quite the opposite for 2014; we experienced a $0.09 per share positive variance to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings did lead to a significant year-over-year variance of $0.17 per share.
We also issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2016 to 2019 totaling $5 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the $260 million increase in our forecasted 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily from accelerated investments in our electric and gas distribution systems. The December 2015 extension of bonus depreciation for certain investments through 2019 has given us the opportunity to bring forward some infrastructure projects that will benefit our customers for years to come.
I do want to point out that with this revised capital plan, we expect no material change to the rate base forecast that we provided last November for IPL and WPL through 2018. We anticipate the increase in forecasted capital expenditures will offset the impact resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generation fleet in an economical manner to serve our customers. We've made significant progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition included installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities, retiring older, less efficient coal units and increasing levels of natural gas-fired and renewable energy generation. 
Since 2010, Alliant Energy has retired or repowered over 1,150 megawatts of coal-fired generation or about 1/3 of our 2009 coal nameplate capacity.  These retirements have been replaced with highly efficient gas-fired generation, which produces approximately half of the carbon emissions when compared to coal-fired generation.
Low natural gas prices in 2015 resulted in significant changes to the capacity factors of our gas units. Riverside had an approximately 50% capacity factor last year, more than double its prior 5-year average. Our Emery combined cycle facility also experienced significant increase in operating hours during 2015. With lower gas prices, the additional gas generation in our portfolio resulted in savings for our customers in 2015.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2015 was again a very active construction year with over $1 billion deployed. Our investments included approximately $360 million for electric and gas distribution systems. This was one of the largest annual investments in those systems and will be an area of drilling investments. These projects are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more reliable and resilient and to expand natural gas services, especially to communities that did not have access before.
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well, and it is now approximately 75% complete. Forecasted capital expenditure for this project are approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
In Wisconsin, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5. This project is approximately 90% complete and is on time and below budget. Capital expenditure forecasts for this project are approximately $270 million, and it is expected to be in service later this year.
Turbine upgrades and pulverizer replacement work continues at Columbia, and these performance improvements projects are expected to be completed next year. This spring, construction of a Columbia Unit 2 SCR will begin. WPL's capital expenditure for this project is approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. In 2013, WPL announced that it will retire several older coal facilities and natural gas peaking units. And after more than 50 years of dependable operation, Nelson Dewey and Edgewater Unit 3 were retired in December. The retirement of these units plus  several other retirements through 2019 will result in a reduction of WPL capacity of approximately 700 megawatts. As a result, WPL proposed to construct the 700-megawatt highly-efficient natural gas generating facility referred to as the Riverside Energy Center expansion. We anticipate the Public Service Commission will issue its decision on the Riverside expansion in the second quarter.
Earlier this month, we announced that we had negotiated options with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives for partial Riverside ownership of up to 55 megawatts during the construction of the facility and up to an additional 250 megawatts during the first 5 years that the facility is operating. With this agreement, the cooperatives have extended their wholesale electric contract with WP&L by 4 years through 2026. We are pleased that our neighbor utilities realize the benefits of our proposed facility and want to be involved in this exciting and innovative project. 
While we now expect the output from the Riverside units to be close to 700 megawatts, the capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC  and transmission. The targeted in-service date has changed from early 2019 to early 2020. Therefore, the timing of the capital expenditures have been updated and are reflected on Slide 3 based on input from the EPC bidders. The expenditures presented for Riverside do not reflect a possible capital reduction if the cooperatives exercise their 55-megawatt purchase options during construction.
In addition to the Riverside joint ownership option, pub service and MG&E will have the options to limit their capital expenditures at Columbia to paying for only the SCR during the time that Riverside is being constructed. Our capital expenditure plan does not reflect this option being executed; however, we expect that any increase in our capital expenditures at Columbia would be largely offset if the electric co-ops exercise their purchase option of 55 megawatts of Riverside.
Earlier this month, United States Supreme Court effectively delayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the EPS rules are resolved. This stay will not change our current resource or capital expenditure plan as they were not based on compliance with the Clean Power Plan. As we plan for our future generation needs, we aim to minimize the emissions while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We believe that with the transition of our generation fleet and the availability of lower natural gas prices, our carbon emissions will continue to decrease.
We're very fortunate to operate in states that have had a long history of support for renewable energy and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation, and our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to meet customer energy needs. In addition, we currently purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Wind energy provided approximately 8% of our customers' energy needs in 2015.
Also, we have several solar projects under development from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they're now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. And in Iowa, we'll be owning and operating the solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids and are reviewing responses to the RFP we issued for additional solar in our portfolio.
There is a sense of excitement as we work to transform the company to meet our customers' evolving expectations. A major improvement to our customer experience just happened as we went live with our new customer care and billing system. This $110 million investment replaced mainframe systems from the 1980s. Our new billing system will make communication with our customers more convenient and timely and allow for us to provide innovative service options. This project was another well-executed major initiative. I do want to thank everyone that worked so hard for years to transform our customer experience. At Alliant Energy, we've already made great progress  transitioning our utilities to a cleaner, more modern energy system. This would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees who keep the customer at the center of everything we do. 
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2015, and we'll work hard to also deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. We anticipate no material change for the rate-based growth through 2018 as the updated capital expenditure plan will offset any impact from the extension of bonus depreciation. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend target.
Successful execution on our major construction project includes completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner; working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; reshaping our organization to be leaner and faster while keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.0",1040,"Good morning, everyone. We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share. The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the sale of IPL's Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and a $0.04 per share charge resulting from the approximately 2% of employees accepting voluntary separation packages as we continue  focusing on matching cost for our customers. Comparisons between 2015 and 2014 earnings per share are detailed on slides 5, 6 and 7.
Retail electric temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% or $0.04 per share at IPL and WP&L between 2015 and 2014. This excludes the impacts of the Minnesota sale. The industrial segment continues to be the largest sales growth driver year-over-year. The 2015 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision from FERC expected to lower ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. We reserved $0.06 per share for 2015, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.82%. This is a result of the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision issued in December 2015. 
Now let's review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater 5 and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station. 
The 2016 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail electric sales increases of approximately 1% for IPL and WP&L, excluding the impacts of the Minnesota sale. Also, the earnings guidance is based on the impacts of IPL and WP&L's previously announced retail electric base rate settlements. The IPL settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from financing the Lansing scrubber in service in 2015. In 2016, IPL expects the credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. During 2016, IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results.
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse projected to be placed in service in 2016. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.
Also included in WP&L's rate settlement was an increase in transmission cost, primarily related to the anticipated allocation of SSR cost. As a result of a FERC order issued after the settlement, the amount of transmission cost billed to WP&L in 2016 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement. Since the PSCW approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission cost, the difference between the actual transmission cost billed to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement has been accumulated in a regulatory liability. We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance of approximately $35 million by the end of 2016. This regulatory liability is another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin retail electric customers.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC for 2016 and provide you the actual effective tax rates for 2015. 
Turning to our financing plan. Our current financing forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deductions for certain capital expenditures for property through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based upon the current federal net operating losses and the credit carryforward position as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit ratings. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plans also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance maturity of term loans. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the proposed Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Before the 5-year extension bonus depreciation, we were not expected to make any material federal income tax payments through 2017. Thus, the extension of the bonus depreciation is not expected to change our financing needs for the next 2 years.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. During the second quarter of 2016, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW on the Riverside expansion proposal, and we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we'll be filing our 5-year emission plan and budget in the first quarter and expect a decision regarding the permit  application for the approximately $60 million Clinton natural gas pipeline in the second quarter. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2017. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the coming year.

I will begin with an overview of our first quarter performance. Then I will review the progress made and transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter energy infrastructure and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our first quarter results, as well as review our regulatory calendar. 
Like other utilities in the region, mild winter temperatures reduced first quarter results, ours by $0.05 per share. This was quite the opposite from first quarter 2015, where we experienced a $0.04 per share positive temperature impact to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings led to a significant quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.09 per share.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plant for the order you transition of our generating fleet, in an economic manner, to serve our customers. We've made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity, and is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural-gas fired and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation, through coal unit retirements, and installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We have also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
Let me brief you on our construction activities. 2016 is another very active construction year with forecast of investments of over $1.1 billion. Our investments are projected to include approximately $300 million for our electric distribution system. These investments are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes $200 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior-year spending. The electric and gas distribution business will continue to be a focus for future investments, as we create a smarter energy infrastructure. 
Now I'll provide an overview of our drilling, investments in new gas-fired generation. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Riverside expansion, and we expect to receive the written order today. We have already received the air permit and are awaiting approval for the water permit. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total anticipated capital expense for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The targeted in service date is by early 2020. Later this month, we plan to announce the engineering, procurement and construction firm selected for this project. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 73% complete. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in spring often 2017.
Riverside and Emery, our two primary existing gas generating facilities, had another quarter of significant increase in their dispatch when compared to prior years. 
During the first quarter of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were more than double their 5-year averages. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices, results in fuel savings for our customers and shows the importance of a balanced energy mix.
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're getting towards the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. 
At Edgewater Unit 5, progress continues on the  installation of a scrubber and bag
house. This project is approximately 97% complete, and it is on time and below budget and should be in-service later this year.
Total capital expenditures for this projects are anticipated to be approximately $270 million. And last month, construction of the Columbia unit 2 SCR began. WPL's total cap expenditure for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in-service in 2018. There are several new water and ash regulations being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which we anticipate will impact 9 of our generating facilities both located across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our water and ash program was designed according to pending EPA and DNR rules and regulations. We have ash pond closers and bottom ash conversion projects underway in Iowa, as outlined in IPL's filed emission plan and budget. In Wisconsin, we filed an application for the certificate of authority for a bottom ash conversion at Edgewater. 
The total expenditures for our water and ash programs are anticipated to be over $200 million during the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
As we plan for our future generation needs, we aim to minimize and environmental impacts while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We believe that our carbon emissions will continue to decrease due to the transition of our generating fleet, the availability of lower natural gas prices and increase of renewable energy.
We have and will continue invest in, and purchase, renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation and purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Our 10-year capital expenditure plan includes additional win investments to meet customer energy needs. 
Also, we have several solar projects from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar, in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison Headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed and they are now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm, on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. 
In Iowa, construction has started on the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, and where we will own and operate the solar panels there. We also anticipate selecting additional solar investment opportunities in the near future.  Listening to our customers and understanding their evolving needs is shaping the path for the future. We replaced our decades old customer information and bidding system which is now providing customers with many more online self service offerings and robust customer communication options. And we have plans to ramp up additional offerings through this new platform. We have managed our company well and made great strides growing our company on behalf of our investors, customers and employees. In fact, our stock price doubled between year-end 2010 and the end of the first quarter of this year. In recognition of this progress, and the growth prospects going forward, the Board of Directors announced a two-for-one stock split last month. Each shareowner of record at the close of business on May 4 will receive one additional share nfor every outstanding common share held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed by May 19 and on May 20, shares will be sold at the post-split price. This is a significant milestone that our company and investors should be proud of.
Let me summarize key messages for today. We'll work to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide a 5% to 7% and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our target in 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend. Successful execution on our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget, and in a very safe manner. Working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster, while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. 
You are invited to join us at our annual meeting this week, which will be held on May 13 in Madison, Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016 earnings. Summary of the quarter-over-quarter earn",733,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016 earnings. Summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slide 2 and 3. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric and temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increase approximately 1% between first quarter 2015 and 2016. The commercial and industrial sectors continued to be the largest sales growth drivers quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90 on a free stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as the Edgewater and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. That earnings guidance is based on the impacts of IPL's and WPL's previously announced retail-based rate settlement.
In 2016, IPL expect to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 by $24 million. IPL expects to provide billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated to impact full year results. The DAEC settlement reflected electric grid was growth for the Edgewater scrubber and back or is projected to be placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this, and other added base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization.
Slide 4 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rate for IPL, the BPL, and AEC. 
Now turning to our forecasted capital expenditures. In March, the pipeline and hazardous materials Safety Administration announced proposed regulations to update the safer requirements for gas pipelines. We currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017. The forecasted capital expenditures provided during our year-end call include estimated amounts for this expected regulations.
Now turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deduction through 2019. As a result of the prior-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carry forward positions, as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next 5 years.
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with those strong cash flows and financing plan, we'll maintain our target liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high oddity credit ratings.
Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll be sharing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy resources. $310 million or proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy resources are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans. As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed, primarily by combination of debt and new common equity.
Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million up new common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. We have several current and planned regulatory for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 5. During the second quarter of this year, we anticipate filing a WPL retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we expect a decision regarding of a permit application for approximately $60 million, Clinton natural gas pipeline. The next Iowa retail electric and gas based rate cases are expected to be filed in the first half of 2017. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter",1343,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter energy infrastructure and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our first quarter results as well as review our regulatory calendar. 
Like other utilities in the region, mild winter temperatures reduced first quarter results, ours by $0.05 per share. This was quite the opposite from first quarter 2015 where we experienced a $0.04 per share positive temperature impact to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings led to a significant quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.09 per share.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet in an economic manner to serve our customers. We've made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost-efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural-gas fired and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation through coal unit retirements and installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We have also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2016 is another very active construction year, with forecast in investments of over $1.1 billion. Our investments are projected to include approximately $300 million for our electric distribution systems. These investments are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes $200 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. The electric and gas distribution business will continue to be a focus for future investments as we create a smarter energy infrastructure. 
Now I'll provide an overview of our growing investments in new gas-fired generation. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Riverside expansion, and we expect to receive the written order today. We have already received the air permit and are awaiting approval for the water permit. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts, and the total anticipated capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. The targeted in-service date is by early 2020. Later this month, we plan to announce the engineering, procurement and construction firm selected for this project. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 73% complete. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017.
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, had another quarter of significant increase in their dispatch when compared to prior years. 
During the first quarter of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were more than double their 5-year averages. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices results in fuel savings for our customers and shows the importance of a balanced energy mix.
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're getting towards the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. At Edgewater Unit 5, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse. This project is approximately 97% complete, and it is on time and below budget and should be in service later this year. Total capital expenditures for these projects are anticipated to be approximately $270 million. 
And last month, construction of the Columbia Unit 2 SCR began. WPL's total capital expenditure for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. 
There are several new water and ash regulations being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which we anticipate will impact 9 of our generating facilities located across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our water and ash program was designed according to pending EPA and DNR rules and regulations. We have ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects underway in Iowa, as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. 
In Wisconsin, we filed an application for the a Certificate of Authority for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater. 
The total expenditures for our water and ash programs are anticipated to be over $200 million during the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our investor relations presentations include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
As we plan for future generation needs, we aim to minimize environmental impacts while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We believe that our carbon emissions will continue to decrease due to the transition of our generating fleet, the availability of lower natural gas prices and increased renewable energy.
We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation and purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to meet customer energy needs. 
Also, we have several solar projects from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they are now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. 
And in Iowa, construction has started on the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels there. We also anticipate selecting additional solar investment opportunities in the near future. 
Listening to our customers and understanding their evolving needs is shaping the path for the future. We replaced our decades-old customer information and billing system, which is now providing customers with many more online self-service offerings and robust customer communication options. And we have plans to ramp up additional offerings through this new platform. 
We have managed our company well and made great strides growing our company on behalf of our investors, customers and employees. In fact, our stock price doubled between year-end 2010 and the end of the first quarter of this year. In recognition of this progress and the growth prospects going forward, the Board of Directors announced a 2-for-1 stock split last month. Each share owner of record at the close of business on May 4 will receive one additional share for every outstanding common share held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed by book entry on May 19, and on May 20, shares will be sold at the post-split price. This is a significant milestone that our company and investors should be proud of.
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We will work to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our target 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner, working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner, reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in the community. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impacts to customers. 
You are invited to join us at our Annual Meeting next week, which will be held on May 13 in Madison, Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings",728,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 2 and 3. 
Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature-normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between first quarter 2015 and 2016. The commercial and industrial sectors continued to be the largest sales growth drivers quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90 on a pre-stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as the Edgewater and Lansing emission control equipment; and higher AFUDC related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance is based on the impacts of IPL's and WP&L's previously announced retail base rate settlement.
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. 
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber baghouse, projected to be placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization.
Slide 4 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. 
Turning to our forecasted capital expenditures. In March, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration announced proposed regulations to update the safety requirements for gas pipelines. We currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017. The forecasted capital expenditures provided during our year-end call include estimated amounts for these expected regulations.
Now turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions, as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years.
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plans assume we will be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 finance plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 5. During the second quarter of this year, we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we expect a decision regarding our permit application for the approximately $60 million Clinton Natural Gas Pipeline. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first half of 2017. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of the company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter",1341,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter energy infrastructure and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our first quarter results as well as review our regulatory calendar. 
Like other utilities in the region, mild winter temperatures reduced first quarter results, ours by $0.05 per share. This was quite the opposite from first quarter 2015 where we experienced a $0.04 per share positive temperature impact to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings led to a significant quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.09 per share.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet in an economic manner to serve our customers. We've made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost-efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural-gas fired and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation through coal unit retirements and installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We have also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2016 is another very active construction year, with forecast investments of over $1.1 billion. Our investments are projected to include approximately $300 million for our electric distribution systems. These investments are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes $200 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. The electric and gas distribution business will continue to be a focus for future investments as we create a smarter energy infrastructure. 
Now I'll provide an overview of our growing investments in new gas-fired generation. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Riverside expansion, and we expect to receive the written order today. We have already received the air permit and are awaiting approval of the water permit. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts, and the total anticipated capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. The targeted in-service date is by early 2020. Later this month, we plan to announce the engineering, procurement and construction firm selected for this project. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 73% complete. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017.
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, had another quarter of significant increase in their dispatch when compared to prior years. 
During the first quarter of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were more than double their 5-year averages. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices results in fuel savings for our customers and shows the importance of a balanced energy mix.
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're getting towards the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. At Edgewater Unit 5, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse. This project is approximately 97% complete, and it is on time and below budget and should be in service later this year. Total capital expenditures for these projects are anticipated to be approximately $270 million. 
And last month, construction of the Columbia Unit 2 SCR began. WPL's total capital expenditure for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and it is expected to go in service in 2018. 
There are several new water and ash regulations being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which we anticipate will impact 9 of our generating facilities located across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our water and ash program was designed according to pending EPA and DNR rules and regulations. We have ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects underway in Iowa, as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. 
In Wisconsin, we filed an application for Certificate of Authority for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater. 
The total expenditures for our water and ash programs are anticipated to be over $200 million during the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our investor relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
As we plan for future generation needs, we aim to minimize environmental impacts while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We believe that our carbon emissions will continue to decrease due to the transition of our generating fleet, the availability of lower natural gas prices and increased renewable energy.
We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation and purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to meet customer energy needs. 
Also, we have several solar projects from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they're now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. 
And in Iowa, construction has started on the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels there. We also anticipate selecting additional solar investment opportunities in the near future. 
Listening to our customers and understanding their evolving needs is shaping the path for the future. We replaced our decades-old customer information and billing system, which is now providing customers with many more online self-service offerings and robust customer communication options. And we have plans to ramp up additional offerings through this new platform. 
We have managed our company well and made great strides growing our company on behalf of our investors, customers and employees. In fact, our stock price doubled between year-end 2010 and the end of the first quarter of this year. In recognition of this progress and the growth prospects going forward, the Board of Directors announced a 2-for-1 stock split last month. Each share owner of record at the close of business on May 4 will receive one additional share for every outstanding common share held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed by book entry on May 19, and on May 20, shares will be sold at the post-split price. This is a significant milestone that our company and investors should be proud of.
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We will work to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our target is 2016 dividend increase by 7% over the 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner, working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner, reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in the community. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impacts to customers. 
You are invited to join us at our Annual Meeting next week, which will be held on May 13 in Madison, Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings",726,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 2 and 3. 
Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature-normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between first quarter 2015 and 2016. The commercial and industrial sectors continued to be the largest sales growth drivers quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90 on a pre-stock-split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater and Lansing emission control equipment, and higher AFUDC related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance is based upon the impacts of IPL's and WP&L's previously announced retail base rate settlement.
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. 
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber baghouse, projected to be placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization.
Slide 4 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. 
Turning to our forecasted capital expenditures. In March, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration announced proposed regulations to update the safety requirements for gas pipelines. We currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017. The forecasted capital expenditures provided during our year-end call include estimated amounts for these expected regulations.
Now turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions, as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years.
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plans assume we will be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 finance plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 5. During the second quarter of this year, we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we expect a decision regarding our permit application for the approximately $60 million Clinton Natural Gas Pipeline. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first half of 2017. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of the company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter",1341,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter performance, then I'll review the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, creating a smarter energy infrastructure and expanding our natural gas system. I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our first quarter results as well as review our regulatory calendar. 
Like other utilities in the region, mild winter temperatures reduced first quarter results, ours by $0.05 per share. This was quite the opposite from first quarter 2015 where we experienced a $0.04 per share positive temperature impact to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings led to a significant quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.09 per share.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet in an economic manner to serve our customers. We've made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost-efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural-gas fired and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation through coal unit retirements and installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We have also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2016 is another very active construction year, with forecast investments of over $1.1 billion. Our investments are projected to include approximately $300 million for our electric distribution systems. These investments are driven by customer expectations to make our electric systems more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes $200 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. The electric and gas distribution business will continue to be a focus for future investments as we create a smarter energy infrastructure. 
Now I'll provide an overview of our growing investments in new gas-fired generation. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Riverside expansion, and we expect to receive the written order today. We have already received the air permit and are awaiting approval of the water permit. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts, and the total anticipated capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. The targeted in-service date is by early 2020. Later this month, we plan to announce the engineering, procurement and construction firm selected for this project. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 73% complete. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017.
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, had another quarter of significant increase in their dispatch when compared to prior years. 
During the first quarter of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were more than double their 5-year averages. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices results in fuel savings for our customers and shows the importance of a balanced energy mix.
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're getting towards the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. At Edgewater Unit 5, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse. This project is approximately 97% complete, and it is on time and below budget and should be in service later this year. Total capital expenditures for these projects are anticipated to be approximately $270 million. 
And last month, construction of the Columbia Unit 2 SCR began. WPL's total capital expenditure for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and it is expected to go in service in 2018. 
There are several new water and ash regulations being developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which we anticipate will impact 9 of our generating facilities located across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our water and ash program was designed according to pending EPA and DNR rules and regulations. We have ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects underway in Iowa, as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. 
In Wisconsin, we filed an application for Certificate of Authority for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater. 
The total expenditures for our water and ash programs are anticipated to be over $200 million during the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our investor relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
As we plan for future generation needs, we aim to minimize environmental impacts while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We believe that our carbon emissions will continue to decrease due to the transition of our generating fleet, the availability of lower natural gas prices and increased renewable energy.
We have and will continue to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568 megawatts of wind generation and purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to meet customer energy needs. 
Also, we have several solar projects from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels have been installed, and they're now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside. 
And in Iowa, construction has started on the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels there. We also anticipate selecting additional solar investment opportunities in the near future. 
Listening to our customers and understanding their evolving needs is shaping the path for the future. We replaced our decades-old customer information and billing system, which is now providing customers with many more online self-service offerings and robust customer communication options. And we have plans to ramp up additional offerings through this new platform. 
We have managed our company well and made great strides growing our company on behalf of our investors, customers and employees. In fact, our stock price doubled between year-end 2010 and the end of the first quarter of this year. In recognition of this progress and the growth prospects going forward, the Board of Directors announced a 2-for-1 stock split last month. Each share owner of record at the close of business on May 4 will receive one additional share for every outstanding common share held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed by book entry on May 19, and on May 20, shares will be sold at the post-split price. This is a significant milestone that our company and investors should be proud of.
Let me summarize the key messages for today. We will work to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our target is 2016 dividend increase by 7% over the 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner, working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner, reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in the community. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impacts to customers. 
You are invited to join us at our Annual Meeting next week, which will be held on May 13 in Madison, Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Tom."

We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings",726,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than first quarter 2015 earnings. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 2 and 3. 
Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature-normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between first quarter 2015 and 2016. The commercial and industrial sectors continued to be the largest sales growth drivers quarter-over-quarter. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90 on a pre-stock-split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater and Lansing emission control equipment, and higher AFUDC related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance is based upon the impacts of IPL's and WP&L's previously announced retail base rate settlement.
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. 
The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber baghouse, projected to be placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization.
Slide 4 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. 
Turning to our forecasted capital expenditures. In March, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration announced proposed regulations to update the safety requirements for gas pipelines. We currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017. The forecasted capital expenditures provided during our year-end call include estimated amounts for these expected regulations.
Now turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on the federal income tax returns over the next 5 years.
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plans assume we will be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources. $310 million of the proceeds at the parent and Alliant Energy Resources are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 finance plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 5. During the second quarter of this year, we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas base case for 2017 and 2018 rates. For IPL, we expect a decision regarding our permit application for the approximately $60 million Clinton Natural Gas Pipeline. The next Iowa retail electric and gas base rate cases are expected to be filed in the first half of 2017. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of the company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

As Susan mentioned, Tom Hanson is vacationing with his children and grandchildren, so Robert Durian and I will handle today's call. I'll begin with an overview on our second quarter performance, then review the progress made in advancing cleaner energy and creating a smarter energy infrastructure for our customers. I will then turn the call over to Robert to provide details on our second quarter financial results as well as review the regulatory calendar. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2016 when compared to 2015 increased by $0.03 per share, which includes a $0.02 positive margin impact from temperatures. The remaining difference was primarily a result of higher allowance for funds used during construction related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. We shared some exciting news last week as governor announced our proposed $1 billion investment traditional wind generation in Iowa. As you recall, we had originally forecasted additional renewable investments in the second 5 years of our 10-year capital plan. This plan accelerates this investment in order to take advantage of the full benefit of the reduction tax credit extension. This means that the expected in-service states of the new wind project will now be in 2019 and 2020. With this announcement, IPL  filed an advanced ratemaking principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board, for [indiscernible] approval to add old and operated wind resources of up to 500 megawatts. A portion of the new wind will likely be located near our existing [indiscernible] site in Franklin County, Iowa. We are also pursuing additional land options. We have requested a return of equity of 11.5%. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
As part of this filing, we have requested a temporary renewable energy rider. This rider would allow us to start recovering and return off and on the wind farm when they are placed in service with us filing a traditional rate case. The rider also allows our customers to immediately receive the financial benefit of the reduction tax credits, along with the energy benefits of the wind generation produced. If the rider is approved, it's expected to remain in effect until the IUB's final decision in a future retail electric base rate case. We requested that the IUB make a decision on its RPU application during the fourth quarter of this year to down payment to secure the full production tax credit extension levels. The full production tax credits and estimated energy benefits would more than offset return off and on the net investment and related O&M expense, resulting in savings to customers over the life of the asset. The production tax credits will decrease by 20% if we are not able to initiate our investment until next year. We issued an RFP to several wind suppliers in late June and expect those responses in a few weeks. After we evaluate the responses, we will then have a better estimate of the total cost and timing of the capital expenditures for the proposed project. If this project is approved, we don't expect our 2016 to 2019 capital plan to change materially. We are finding that some of planned capital projects are coming in below the original forecast and we expect to reprioritize and in some instances, delay certain of the capital expenditures that have not yet begun. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release. We do not anticipate that these changes to our capital expenditure plan will cause a change in our long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7%. 
Renewable energy has been a meaningful part of our energy resources. We currently have 568 megawatts of old wind generation and anticipate supplementing that with approximately 770 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The proposed Iowa investment would almost double our owned and operated wind generation and place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electricity utilities with owned wind energy for our customers. 
In addition to the RPU request for 500 megawatts of new wind investments, we anticipate filing a restructuring request with the IUB later this quarter to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy resources through IPL. The transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. Therefore, our application -- if our application is approved by both the IUB and FERC, we would expect to take a nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately half of Franklin County's net book value. We're also evaluating additional wind energy purposes and future investments for Wisconsin customers. This will add economic and stable energy to our fuel cost and allow us to offset market purchases of energy. 
[indiscernible] generation is also an expansion -- expanding part of our renewable portfolio. We continue gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels are now generating power for the building. Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside, is also now generating power. And in Iowa, construction's quickly progressing at Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels. [indiscernible] as well as our recent announcement of the solar collaboration with the city of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable forces closer to our customers and working with them to create sustainable energy future. 
Next week, we will issue our first corporate sustainability report, which is an expansion of our past environmental reports. The report does highlight that we have made significant reductions and [indiscernible] emissions. Report also highlights that carbon emissions continue to decrease through additional renewable energy, increased use of efficient national gas fired generation and the transition of our coal generation fleet. Therefore, we expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels. 
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecast investments of over $1.1 billion, with almost half of that focused on our distribution systems. Approximately $300 million is being invested in our electric distribution system to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $200 million from improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. As you were aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Riverside expansion earlier this year. We expect the [indiscernible] from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total anticipated capital expenditure remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. [indiscernible] has been selected to perform the engineering, procurement and construction and [indiscernible] selected, our [indiscernible], one of the most efficient units in production. In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generating facility is progressing well and is approximately 85% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on-time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to prior years. During the first half of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were approximately double the 5-year average. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation to improve the low gas prices and also as a flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days demonstrate the importance of this resource and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving on to our existing coal fleet, renewing the end of our successful program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. The Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget. Construction of the Columbia unit 2 SCR is approximately 18% complete. WPL's total capital expenditure plan for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. There are [indiscernible] regulations on the horizon, given [indiscernible] and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have plan and have begun to initiate that work needs to comply with these rules and regulations. closures and bottom ash conversion projects are underway in Iowa as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. In Wisconsin, PSCW recently approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total expenditures for our ash and water programs are anticipated to be over $200 million during the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that is ore emissions, greater fuel diversity and more cost efficient. The tradition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation to retirements and fuel switching, emission controls and performance upgrade of our largest coal-fired facilities. We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements and I am proud of the fact we've accomplished all that while holding electric bass rates flat to both IPL and WPL since 2011. 
Let me summarize our key messages. We have work to deliver 2016 financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner. Working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner. Reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster or keeping our focus on serving our customers and be in good partners on our communities. And we will continue to manage the company [indiscernible] capital investment, operational and financial discipline and [indiscernible] customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. 
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

A summary of the qua",1043,"Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, which was $0.03 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, excluding Minnesota. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth drivers year-over-year. The second quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the return on equity levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. We reserved $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an anticipated all in ROE of 10.2%, a reduction of 200 basis points from ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June in 2016. We are expecting a FERC decision by the end of this year for the first complaint and within the first quarter of 2017 for the second complaint. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $1.80 and $1.95 per share on a full stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as emission control equipment at Edgewater 5 and Lansing, and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance was based upon the impacts of IPL's and WPL's previously announced retail-based rate settlement. In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million in 2016, [indiscernible] riders may have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated impact to full year results. The WPL's settlement for the 2016 test period reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization. 
In addition, Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling 2016 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecasting corporate's extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 with the portfolio's wind investments at IPL. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and current carryforward position as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and up to $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and the requested 500-megawatt wind investment at IPL. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures for 2017 will be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of new common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent, if marketing conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 7. For IPL, our permit application for the [indiscernible] natural gas pipeline has been approved. During the rest of this year,  we'll be supporting the filing to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa and later this quarter, we plan to file a restructuring request to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving decisions on both of these filings prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in April 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. 
For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base rate case, which resulted from collaboration with the citizens utility board, the Wisconsin industrial energy group and PSCW staff. Elements of this retail electric and gas increase proposal. This filing includes new pricing options as well as an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year, with new rates effective January 1, 2017. 
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during our next 2 quarterly earnings calls. Specifically, during the third quarter, we have provided our following years earnings guidance and dividend target as well as updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February. During our third call in November of this year, we expect to provide 2017 dividend target, updated capital expenditure forecast and updated rate base forecast.

As Susan mentioned, Tom Hanson is off vacationing with his children and grandchildren, so Robert Durian and I will handle today's call. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter performance, then review the progress made in advancing cleaner energy and creating a smarter energy infrastructure for our customers. I will then turn the call over to Robert to provide details on our second quarter financial results as well as review the regulatory calendar. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2016 when compared to 2015 increased by $0.03 per share, which includes a $0.02 positive margin impact from temperatures. The remaining difference was primarily a result of higher allowance for funds used during construction related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. We shared some exciting news last week as Governor Branstad and I announced our proposed $1 billion investment for additional wind generation in Iowa. 
As you recall, we had originally forecasted additional renewable investments in the second 5 years of our 10-year capital plan. This plan accelerates this investment in order to take advantage of the full benefit of the reduction tax credit extension. This means that the expected in-service states of the new wind project will now be in 2019 and 2020. With this announcement, IPL filed an advanced ratemaking principles principals application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board for [indiscernible] approval to add own and operated wind resources of up to 500 megawatts. A portion of the new wind will likely be located near our existing Whispering Willow site in Franklin County, Iowa. And we are also pursuing additional land options. We have requested a return on equity of 11.5%. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
As part of this filing, we have requested a temporary renewable energy rider. This rider would allow us to start recovering and return off and on the wind farm when they are placed in service without filing a traditional rate case. The rider also allows our customers to immediately receive the financial benefit of the reduction tax credits, along with the energy benefits of the wind generation produced. If the rider is approved, it's expected to remain in effect until the IUB's final decision in a future retail electric base rate case. We requested that the IUB make a decision on its RPU application during the fourth quarter of this year so we can make a determined down payment to secure the full production tax credit extension levels. 
The full production tax credits and estimated energy benefits would more than offset return off and on the net investment and related O&M expense, resulting in savings to customers over the life of the asset. The production tax credits will decrease by 20% if we are not able to initiate our investment until next year. We issued an RFP to several wind suppliers in late June and expect those responses in a few weeks. After we evaluate the responses, we will then have a better estimate of the total cost and timing of the capital expenditures for the proposed project. If this project is approved, we don't expect our 2016 to 2019 capital plan to change materially. We are finding that some of planned capital projects are coming in below the original forecast and we expect to reprioritize, and in some instances, delay certain of the capital expenditures that have not yet begun. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release. We do not anticipate that these changes to our capital expenditure plan will cause a change in our long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7%. 
Renewable energy has been a meaningful part of our energy resources. We currently have 568 megawatts of old wind generation and anticipate supplementing that with approximately 770 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The proposed Iowa investment would almost double our owned and operated wind generation and place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electricity utilities with owned wind energy for our customers. 
In addition to the RPU request for 500 megawatts of new wind investments, we anticipate filing a restructuring request with the IUB later this quarter to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy resources to IPL. The transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. Therefore, our application -- if our application is approved by both the IUB and FERC, we would expect to take a nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately half of Franklin County's net book value. We're also evaluating additional wind energy purposes and future investments for Wisconsin customers. This will add economic and stable energy to our fuel cost and allow us to offset market purchases of energy. 
Solar generation is also an expansion -- expanding part of our renewable portfolio. We continue gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels are now generating power for the building. Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside, is also now generating power. 
And in Iowa, construction's quickly progressing at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels. [indiscernible] as well as our recent announcement of the solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create sustainable energy future. 
Next week, we will issue our first corporate sustainability report, which is an expansion of our past environmental reports. The report does highlight that we have made significant reductions in NOx, SOx and mercury emissions. Report also highlights that carbon emissions continue to decrease through additional renewable energy, increased use of efficient natural gas-fired generation and the transition of our coal generation fleet. Therefore, we expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels. 
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecast investments of over $1.1 billion, with almost half of that focused on our distribution systems. Approximately $300 million is being invested in our electric distribution system to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $200 million from improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. As you were aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Riverside expansion earlier this year. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total anticipated capital expenditure remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected to perform the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbine selected are GE Frame 7, one of the most efficient units in production. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generating facility is progressing well and is approximately 85% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project is anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on-time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to prior years. During the first half of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were approximately double the 5-year average. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during a period of low gas prices, and also as a flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days, demonstrate the importance of this resource and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. The Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget. Construction of the Columbia unit 2 SCR is approximately 18% complete. WPL's total capital expenditure plan for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. There are several new regulations on the horizon, dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate that work needs to comply with these rules and regulations. 
Ash ponds closures and bottom ash conversion projects are underway in Iowa as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. In Wisconsin, PSCW recently approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total expenditures for our ash and water programs are anticipated to be over $200 million for the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation to retirements and fuel switching and then installing emission controls and performance upgrade at our largest coal-fired facilities. We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements. And I am proud of the fact we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat to both IPL and WPL since 2011. 
Let me summarize our key messages. We have work to deliver 2016 financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster or keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners on our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost [ph] them back to the customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released second quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, which was $0.03 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, excluding Minnesota. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth drivers year-over-year. The second quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the return on equity levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. 
We reserved $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%, a reduction of 200 basis points from ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June in 2016. We are expecting a FERC decision by the end of this year for the first complaint and within the first quarter of 2017 for the second complaint. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $1.80 and $1.95 per share on a full stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as emission control equipment at Edgewater 5 and Lansing, and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance was based upon the impacts of IPL's and WPL's previously announced retail-based rate settlement. 
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million in 2016, per year the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated impact to full year results. The WPL settlement for the 2016 test period reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization. 
In addition, Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling 2016 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 with the portfolio's wind investments at IPL. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward position as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and up to $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and the requested 500-megawatt wind investment at IPL. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures for 2017 will be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of new common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent, if marketing conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 7. For IPL, our permit application for the Clinton natural gas pipeline has been approved. During the rest of this year,  we'll be supporting the filing to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. And later this quarter, we plan to file a restructuring request to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving decisions on both of these filings prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in April 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. 
For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base rate case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff, elements of this retail electric and gas increase proposal. This filing includes new pricing options as well as an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year, with new rates effective January 1, 2017. 
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during our next 2 quarterly earnings calls. Typically, during the third quarter, we have provided our following years' earnings guidance and dividend target as well as updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February. During our third call in November of this year, we expect to provide 2017 dividend target, updated capital expenditure forecast and updated rate base forecast. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session."

As Susan mentioned, Tom Hanson is off vacationing with his children and grandchildren, so Robert Durian and I will handle today's call. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter performance, then review the progress made in advancing cleaner energy and creating a smarter energy infrastructure for our customers. I will then turn the call over to Robert to provide details on our second quarter financial results as well as review the regulatory calendar. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2016 when compared to 2015 increased by $0.03 per share, which includes a $0.02 positive margin impact from temperatures. The remaining difference was primarily a result of higher allowance for funds used during construction related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. We shared some exciting news last week as Governor Branstad and I announced our proposed $1 billion investment for additional wind generation in Iowa. 
As you recall, we had originally forecasted additional renewable investments in the second 5 years of our 10-year capital plan. This plan accelerates this investment in order to take advantage of the full benefit of the production tax credit extension. This means that the expected in-service dates of the new wind project will now be in 2019 and 2020. With this announcement, IPL filed an advanced ratemaking principles application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval to add owned and operated wind resources of up to 500 megawatts. A portion of the new wind will likely be located near our existing Whispering Willow site in Franklin County, Iowa. And we are also pursuing additional land options. We have requested a return on equity of 11.5%. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
As part of this filing, we have requested a temporary renewable energy rider. This rider would allow us to start recovering and return of and on the wind farm when they are placed in service without filing a traditional rate case. The rider also allows our customers to immediately receive the financial benefits of the production tax credits, along with the energy benefits of the wind generation produced. If the rider is approved, it's expected to remain in effect until the IUB's final decision in a future retail electric base rate case. We requested that the IUB make a decision on this RPU application during the fourth quarter of this year so we can make a determined down payment to secure the full production tax credit extension levels. 
The full production tax credits and estimated energy benefits would more than offset return of and on the net investment and related O&M expense, resulting in savings to customers over the life of the asset. The production tax credits will decrease by 20% if we are not able to initiate our investment until next year. We issued an RFP to several wind suppliers in late June and expect those responses in a few weeks. After we evaluate the responses, we will then have a better estimate of the total cost and timing of the capital expenditures for the proposed project. If this project is approved, we don't expect our 2016 to 2019 capital plan to change materially. We are finding that some of our planned capital projects are coming in below the original forecast and we expect to reprioritize, and in some instances, delay certain of the capital expenditures that have not yet begun. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release. We do not anticipate that these changes to our capital expenditure plan will cause a change in our long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7%. 
Renewable energy has been a meaningful part of our energy resources. We currently have 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and anticipate supplementing that with approximately 770 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The proposed Iowa investment would almost double our owned and operated wind generation and place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electricity utilities with owned wind energy for our customers. 
In addition to the RPU request for 500 megawatts of new wind investments, we anticipate filing a restructuring request with the IUB later this quarter to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. The transfer must be made at the lower of cost or market. Therefore, our application -- if our application is approved by both the IUB and FERC, we would expect to take a nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately half of Franklin County's net book value. We're also evaluating additional wind energy purposes and future investments for Wisconsin customers. This will add economic and stable energies to our fuel cost and allow us to offset market purchases of energy. 
Solar generation is also an expansion -- expanding part of our renewable portfolio. We continue gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels are now generating power for the building. Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside, is also now generating power. 
And in Iowa, construction's quickly progressing at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels. Initiatives such as these as well as our recent announcement of the solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future. 
Next week, we will issue our first corporate sustainability report, which is an expansion of our past environmental reports. The report does highlight that we have made significant reductions in NOx, SOx and mercury emissions. Report also highlights that carbon emissions continue to decrease through additional renewable energy, increased use of efficient natural gas-fired generation and the transition of our coal generation fleet. Therefore, we expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels. 
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.1 billion, with almost half of that focused on our distribution systems. Approximately $300 million is being invested in our electric distribution systems to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $200 million from improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Riverside expansion earlier this year. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total anticipated capital expenditure remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected to perform the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines selected are GE Frame 7, one of the most efficient units in production. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generating facility is progressing well and is approximately 85% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project is anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on-time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to prior years. During the first half of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were approximately double their 5-year average. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices, and also as a flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days, demonstrate the importance of this resource and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. The Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget. Construction of the Columbia unit 2 SCR is approximately 18% complete. WPL's total capital expenditure plan for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. There are several new regulations on the horizon, dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate that work needs to comply with these rules and regulations. 
Ash ponds closures and bottom ash conversion projects are underway in Iowa as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. In Wisconsin, PSCW recently approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total expenditures for our ash and water programs are anticipated to be over $200 million for the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation to retirements and fuel switching and then installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements. And I am proud of the fact we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat to both IPL and WPL since 2011. 
Let me summarize our key messages. We will work to deliver 2016 financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost them back to the customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

A summary of the qua",1049,"Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, which was $0.03 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, excluding Minnesota. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth drivers year-over-year. The second quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the return on equity levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. 
We reserved $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%, a reduction of 200 basis points from ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June in 2016. We are expecting a FERC decision by the end of this year for the first complaint and within the first quarter of 2017 for the second complaint. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $1.80 and $1.95 per share on a post stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as emission control equipment at Edgewater 5 and Lansing, and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance was based upon the impacts of IPL's and WPL's previously announced retail-based rate settlement. 
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million in 2016. As prior years [ph] the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. The WPL settlement for the 2016 test period reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization. 
In addition, Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling 2016 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 with the proposed wind investments at IPL. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and up to $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and the requested 500-megawatt wind investment at IPL. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures for 2017 will be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of new common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent, if marketing conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 7. For IPL, our permit application for the Clinton natural gas pipeline has been approved. During the rest of this year,  we'll be supporting the filing to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. And later this quarter, we plan to file a restructuring request to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving decisions on both of these filings prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in April 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. 
For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base rate case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff, elements of this retail electric and gas increase proposal. This filing includes new pricing options as well as an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year, with new rates effective January 1, 2017. 
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during our next 2 quarterly earnings calls. Typically, during the third quarter, we have provided our following year's earnings guidance and dividend target as well as updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February. During our third call in November of this year, we expect to provide 2017 dividend target, updated capital expenditure forecast and updated rate base forecast. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session."

So that's something we'll be evaluating over the next several months. You asked about precedent. Again, you're familiar that we've done this on the Wisconsin side of the house already.

As Susan mentioned, Tom Hanson is off vacationing with his children and grandchildren, so Robert Durian and I will handle today's call. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter performance, then review the progress made in advancing cleaner energy and creating a smarter energy infrastructure for our customers. I will then turn the call over to Robert to provide details on our second quarter financial results as well as review the regulatory calendar. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2016 when compared to 2015 increased by $0.03 per share, which includes a $0.02 positive margin impact from temperatures. The remaining difference was primarily a result of higher allowance for funds used during construction related to the Marshalltown Generating Station. We shared some exciting news last week as Governor Branstad and I announced our proposed $1 billion investment for additional wind generation in Iowa. 
As you recall, we had originally forecasted additional renewable investments in the second 5 years of our 10-year capital plan. This plan accelerates this investment in order to take advantage of the full benefit of the production tax credit extension. This means that the expected in-service dates of the new wind project will now be in 2019 and 2020. With this announcement, IPL filed an advanced ratemaking principles application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval to add owned and operated wind resources of up to 500 megawatts. A portion of the new wind will likely be located near our existing Whispering Willow site in Franklin County, Iowa. And we are also pursuing additional land options. We have requested a return on equity of 11.5%. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
As part of this filing, we have requested a temporary renewable energy rider. This rider would allow us to start recovering and return of and on the wind farm when they are placed in service without filing a traditional rate case. The rider also allows our customers to immediately receive the financial benefits of the production tax credits, along with the energy benefits of the wind generation produced. If the rider is approved, it's expected to remain in effect until the IUB's final decision in a future retail electric base rate case. We requested that the IUB make a decision on this RPU application during the fourth quarter of this year so we can make a determined down payment to secure the full production tax credit extension levels. 
The full production tax credits and estimated energy benefits would more than offset return of and on the net investment and related O&M expense, resulting in savings to customers over the life of the asset. The production tax credits will decrease by 20% if we are not able to initiate our investment until next year. We issued an RFP to several wind suppliers in late June and expect those responses in a few weeks. After we evaluate the responses, we will then have a better estimate of the total cost and timing of the capital expenditures for the proposed project. If this project is approved, we don't expect our 2016 to 2019 capital plan to change materially. We are finding that some of our planned capital projects are coming in below the original forecast and we expect to reprioritize, and in some instances, delay certain of the capital expenditures that have not yet begun. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release. We do not anticipate that these changes to our capital expenditure plan will cause a change in our long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7%. 
Renewable energy has been a meaningful part of our energy resources. We currently have 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and anticipate supplementing that with approximately 770 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The proposed Iowa investment would almost double our owned and operated wind generation and place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electricity utilities with owned wind energy for our customers. 
In addition to the RPU request for 500 megawatts of new wind investments, we anticipate filing a restructuring request with the IUB later this quarter to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. The transfer must be made at the lower of cost or market. Therefore, our application -- if our application is approved by both the IUB and FERC, we would expect to take a nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately half of Franklin County's net book value. We're also evaluating additional wind energy purposes and future investments for Wisconsin customers. This will add economic and stable energies to our fuel cost and allow us to offset market purchases of energy. 
Solar generation is also an expansion -- expanding part of our renewable portfolio. We continue gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels are now generating power for the building. Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside, is also now generating power. 
And in Iowa, construction's quickly progressing at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels. Initiatives such as these as well as our recent announcement of the solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future. 
Next week, we will issue our first corporate sustainability report, which is an expansion of our past environmental reports. The report does highlight that we have made significant reductions in NOx, SOx and mercury emissions. Report also highlights that carbon emissions continue to decrease through additional renewable energy, increased use of efficient natural gas-fired generation and the transition of our coal generation fleet. Therefore, we expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels. 
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.1 billion, with almost half of that focused on our distribution systems. Approximately $300 million is being invested in our electric distribution systems to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $200 million from improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year's spending. As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Riverside expansion earlier this year. 
We expect the output from the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total anticipated capital expenditure remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected to perform the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines selected are GE Frame 7, one of the most efficient units in production. 
In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generating facility is progressing well and is approximately 85% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project is anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on-time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. 
Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary existing gas generating facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to prior years. During the first half of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were approximately double their 5-year average. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices, and also as a flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days, demonstrate the importance of this resource and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving on to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. The Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget. Construction of the Columbia unit 2 SCR is approximately 18% complete. WPL's total capital expenditure plan for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. There are several new regulations on the horizon, dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate that work needs to comply with these rules and regulations. 
Ash ponds closures and bottom ash conversion projects are underway in Iowa as outlined in IPL's filed emissions plan and budget. In Wisconsin, PSCW recently approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total expenditures for our ash and water programs are anticipated to be over $200 million for the next 7 years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation include the near-term expenditures for this program. 
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation to retirements and fuel switching and then installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements. And I am proud of the fact we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat to both IPL and WPL since 2011. 
Let me summarize our key messages. We will work to deliver 2016 financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost them back to the customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

A summary of the qua",1049,"Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, which was $0.03 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 3, 4 and 5. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, excluding Minnesota. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth drivers year-over-year. The second quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the return on equity levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. 
We reserved $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%, a reduction of 200 basis points from ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC administrative law judge's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June in 2016. We are expecting a FERC decision by the end of this year for the first complaint and within the first quarter of 2017 for the second complaint. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $1.80 and $1.95 per share on a post stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, such as emission control equipment at Edgewater 5 and Lansing, and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. The earnings guidance was based upon the impacts of IPL's and WPL's previously announced retail-based rate settlement. 
In 2016, IPL expects to credit customer bills by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million in 2016. As prior years [ph] the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. The WPL settlement for the 2016 test period reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortization. 
In addition, Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling 2016 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 with the proposed wind investments at IPL. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next 5 years. 
Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong, given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high-quality credit rating. Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL and up to $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses. 
As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and the requested 500-megawatt wind investment at IPL. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures for 2017 will be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of new common equity. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent, if marketing conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 7. For IPL, our permit application for the Clinton natural gas pipeline has been approved. During the rest of this year,  we'll be supporting the filing to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. And later this quarter, we plan to file a restructuring request to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving decisions on both of these filings prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in April 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. 
For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base rate case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff, elements of this retail electric and gas increase proposal. This filing includes new pricing options as well as an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year, with new rates effective January 1, 2017. 
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during our next 2 quarterly earnings calls. Typically, during the third quarter, we have provided our following year's earnings guidance and dividend target as well as updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February. During our third call in November of this year, we expect to provide 2017 dividend target, updated capital expenditure forecast and updated rate base forecast. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session."

Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, narrowed our 2016 earnings guidance range and announced the 2017 common stock dividend target. That release also provided an updated annual capital expenditure plan through 2020 and our forecasted total CapEx for 2021 through 2025. 
I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Warmer than normal winter temperatures lowered first quarter earnings, but the warmer summer increased third quarter earnings, resulting in a year-to-date temperature impact sales being close to normal. Therefore, temperature variances have had virtually no impact on our year-to-date earnings. So with summer behind us, we are narrowing our 2016 earnings guidance with the midpoint remaining at $1.88 per share, which is consistent with the earnings guidance provided in the November 15 on a post [indiscernible] basis. I will provide details for the quarter later in the call. 
As we previously indicated, 2017 earnings guidance will be issued in conjunction with our year-end call in February. However, I am reaffirming that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%. 
Yesterday, we also announced a 7% increase of our targeted 2017 common dividend to $1.26 per share. The 2017 dividend target payout ratio is consistent with our long-term target dividend payout ratio of [indiscernible] of consolidated earnings. 
We also issued our 2016 to 2020 updated capital expenditure plan totaling $6.6 billion as shown on Slide 2. 
In addition, on Slide 3, we have provided a [indiscernible] from the previous 2016 to 2019 plan to our current plan. As you can see, the changes are driven primarily by additional renewable generation investments, offset partially with lower capital projects in other parts of the company. 
As you can see on Slide 4, we have provided a 10-year view of our forecasted capital expenditures. These investments in the first 5 years of the 10-year plan are higher than previously disclosed since we are accelerating our previously forecasted renewable investments for both IPL and WPL to take advantage of federal production tax credits. We are fortunate that we have the ability to serve our customers with economic renewable generation, which has the added benefit of providing stable fuel costs. As energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunities to better serve our customers. Our current plan does include additional generation needs beyond 2020, which we anticipate will be renewable, and natural gas generation investments. 
When reviewing Slide 4, it is also important to note that over 50% of the 10-year capital plan is projected to enhance electric and gas distribution systems. Customers and communities expect us to [indiscernible] a liability while creating a system that is increasingly interactive and dynamic. This includes making investments that accelerate the integration of new technologies, including distributor resources. 
Also, for your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation that details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2020 as well as updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates. 
Now let me brief you on our FERC regulatory activities. Last month, we shared with you the settlement reached with the customer groups in Iowa relating to our advanced ratemaking principles filing associated with the proposed 500 megawatts new wind project in Iowa. I am pleased to report that last week, the IUB issued its order on the proposal in an expedited fashion. Details of the order include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission costs, a return equity of 11% to the life of the asset and a depreciable life of 40 years. The [indiscernible] project is included in our capital expenditures and construction work in progress forecast and the rate base estimate assumes that 250 megawatts are to be in service in 2019 and the remaining 250 megawatts in service in 2020. We are currently evaluating the bids from the wind suppliers and should have that selection by year-end to qualify for the 100% of the federal production tax credits. 
Renewable energy is currently a meaningful part of our energy sources, including 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and approximately 730 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. The new Iowa wind project will [indiscernible] up to 500 megawatts, which will place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for its customers. 
We also plan to transfer the 100-megawatt Franklin County windfarm to IPL from Alliant Energy Resources and we'll file that request with FERC later this month. And for application that's approved by FERC, we will expect to transfer Franklin County to IPL during the first quarter of 2017. 
We expect the investments we evaluated as part of our revenue requirement for the IPL rate case filing in the spring of 2017. The Franklin County wind farm will then be combined with its neighbor, IPL's Whispering Willow wind farm. In addition to IPL's additional 500-megawatt wind expansion and the planned transfer of the 100-megawatt Franklin County to IPL, we're exploring options for IPL and WPL to own and operate additional new wind generation. Our current estimated capital expenditures assume 400 megawatts of additional new wind generation, split evenly between IPL and WPL. But the final size and allocation between IPL and WPL is subject to change and further evaluation. 
Solar generation is also an expanding part of our balance generation portfolio as we continue to get experience on our best integrated into the electric system. We now have several solar projects within our service territory, including this continent's largest solar farm on [indiscernible] at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We believe initiatives such as these as well as our announced solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bring our renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future. 
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.2 billion. Included in that is approximately $300 million for electric distribution system to continue to make the more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $170 million from [indiscernible] expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior-year spending. And we broke ground at the Riverside expansion in September. We expect the [indiscernible] from the Riverside expansion to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total interest paid to project cost remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected for the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines are [indiscernible], one of the most efficient units in production. The [indiscernible] recently signed the letter of intent to acquire approximately 50 megawatts of Riverside, which is subject to PSCW approval. Once approved, the [indiscernible] will start acquiring their share of the project during the construction phase. Also, PSCW approved our revised operating plant to allow for WPL to increase its ownership share of Colombia, whereas WPS and MG&E will decrease their ownership share. In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generated facility is progressing well and is approximately 94% complete. Total capital expenditure for this project are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. Riverside and Emery, our chief primary assisting gas generation facilities continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to last year. During the first 9 months of 2016, Emery is averaging 40% capacity factor and Riverside's average capacity factor exceeds 55%. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices and also at the flexible resource during periods of low end and cloudy days demonstrates the value of gas resources and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program through these emissions at our largest facilities. WPL's Edgewater Unit 5 [indiscernible] baghouse project was completed on time and below budget earlier this year. Construction of the Colombia unit to SCR is approximately 35% complete and the total CapEx is anticipated to be $50 million and is expected to be in service in 2018. 
There are several deregulations on the horizon [indiscernible] ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate the work needed to comply with these rules and regulations and ash pond closures [indiscernible] conversion projects are already underway in Iowa. In Wisconsin, the PSCW approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total cap expenditures for our water and ash program are anticipated to be over $155 million during the next 10 years and are included in our capital expenditure forecast and rate base projections. 
During the past 2 years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress building a generation portfolio that is lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost effective. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, installing emission controls and performance upgrade at our largest coal-fired facilities and lower levels of coal generation to reduce economic dispatch, retirements and fuel switching. 
We've also started water and ash programs at our facility to a current and expected future environmental requirement. 
And I'm proud of the fact, we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WPL since 2011. 
Let me summarize my key messages for today. We will continue to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide a 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend increased by 7% over 2016 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects includes completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner. Working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner, reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers being good partners in our community and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to thank him for his thoughtful leadership and being by my side during the past 5 years. The strong relationships he developed across our company, industry and investor community have made a difference for our customers, employees and share owners. I wish Tom and his family all the best as he transitions to a new phase in his life. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 20",622,"Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. 
We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. The nonrecurring $0.23 per share charges for the third quarter of this year relate to the asset valuation charges for the Franklin County windfarm. As Pat indicated, we seek FERC approval to transfer this asset to IPL and per Iowa [indiscernible] code, the transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. The current value of the Franklin County windfarm as of September 30, 2016, was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. When 2016 earnings guidance was issued in November 2015, we forecasted temperature normalize, retail electric sales would increase 1% for the two utilities. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature normalized sales increased almost 1%. IPL sales are relatively flat year-over-year, whereas WP&L sales have exceeded 1% sales growth forecast. 
The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth customer classes year-over-year in both utilities. The third quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our EPC earnings to reflect the recent FERC decision related to the first complaint and the anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the ROE levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. The reserve for the first complaint reflects on all-in ROE of 10.82% and the reserve for the second complaint reflects an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC ALJ's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June of this year. We are expecting a FERC decision by the second quarter of 2017 for the second complaint. 
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. Since we are through 3 quarters of this year, we have narrowed the 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.84 to $1.92 per share, which leaves the middle point still at $1.88 per share, consistent with the guidance we issued in November 2015. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to remind you of a couple unusual negative drivers for the fourth quarter 2015 earnings. First, fourth quarter 2015 temperatures negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 per share on a post stock split basis. Also, we recorded additional reserves related to ATC in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the ALJ issued the opinion on the first MISO ROE complaint. And finally, timing of income taxes was a negative driver on the fourth quarter of 2015. These reminders should assist you with your estimation of the fourth quarter 2016 earnings. 
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. On this slide, we estimate Alliant Energy consolidated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 4% lower than our effective tax rate guidance provided as part of the second quarter call. A reduction in the estimated effective tax rate with the consolidated entity is primarily the result of the Franklin County asset valuation charges recorded this quarter. 
As I conclude my last earnings call remarks, I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to all the analysts, investors and employees. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know all of you. I'm very proud of how this company has evolved over the last 36 years and all of you have been instrumental in making this journey memorable and successful. Thank you. 
I will now turn the call over to Robert to review the financing plans and regulatory calendar."

Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deduction through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan, this forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit rating. 
Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. We have completed the long term debt issuances for 2016, which included issuing long-term debt of $300 million at IPL and $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds were used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses. 
Our 2017 financing plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust these plans as [indiscernible], as market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and renewable investments in our capital expenditure plan. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and a combination of debt and new common equity. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL, consistent with the most recent retail base rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory [indiscernible] of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. For IPL, our permit applications for the Clinton natural gas pipeline and the up to 500 megawatt Iowa wind investment have been improved. Later this quarter, we plan to file a request with FERC to transfer the Franklin County windfarm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving a decision on this request prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in the spring of 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base case, which resulted from collaboration with the citizens utility board, the Wisconsin industrial energy group and PSCW staff. This filing includes new pricing options and an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1, 2017. 
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during the year-end call. Typically, during the third quarter call, we provide our following year's earnings guidance. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year-end call next February. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI finance conference next week. As Pat mentioned, the presentation for this event has been posted on our website this morning.

With Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. We thank you for your service to our country and for protecting the freedom of people around the world. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families that support those on active duty as well as our veterans.
Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, narrowed our 2016 earnings guidance range and announced the 2017 common stock dividend target. That release also provided an updated annual capital expenditure plan through 2020 and our forecasted total CapEx for 2021 through 2025.
I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Warmer than normal winter temperatures lowered first quarter earnings, but the warmer summer increased third quarter earnings, resulting in a year-to-date temperature impact sales being close to normal. Therefore, temperature variances have had virtually no impact on our year-to-date earnings. So with summer behind us, we are narrowing our 2016 earnings guidance with the midpoint remaining at $1.88 per share, which is consistent with the earnings guidance provided in the November 15 on a post stock split basis. Tom will provide details for the quarter later in the call.
As we previously indicated, 2017 earnings guidance will be issued in conjunction with our year-end call in February. However, I am reaffirming that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%.
Yesterday, we also announced a 7% increase of our targeted 2017 common dividend to $1.26 per share. The 2017 dividend target payout ratio is consistent with our long-term target dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings.
We also issued our 2016 to 2020 updated capital expenditure plan totaling $6.6 billion as shown on Slide 2. 
In addition, on Slide 3, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 plan to our current plan. As you can see, the changes are driven primarily by additional renewable generation investments, offset partially with lower capital projects at other parts of the company. 
As you can see on Slide 4, we have provided a 10-year view of our forecasted capital expenditures. These investments in the first 5 years of the 10-year plan are higher than previously disclosed since we are accelerating our previously forecasted renewable investments for both IPL and WPL to take advantage of federal production tax credits. We are fortunate that we have the ability to serve our customers with economic renewable generation, which has the added benefit of providing stable fuel costs. As energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunities to better serve our customers. Our current plan does include additional generation needs beyond 2020, which we anticipate will be renewable, and natural gas generation investments. 
When reviewing Slide 4, it is also important to note that over 50% of the 10-year capital plan is projected to enhance electric and gas distribution systems. Customers and communities expect us to maintain reliability while creating a system that is increasingly interactive and dynamic. This includes making investments that accelerate the integration of new technologies, including distributor resources.
Also, for your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation that details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2020 as well as updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.
Now let me brief you on our current regulatory activities. Last month, we shared with you the settlement reached with the customer groups in Iowa relating to our advanced ratemaking principles filing associated with the proposed 500 megawatt New Wind Project in Iowa. I am pleased to report that last week, the IUB issued its order on the proposal in an expedited fashion. Details of the order include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission costs, a return equity of 11% to the life of the asset, and a depreciable life of 40 years. The New Wind Project is included in our capital expenditures and construction work in progress forecast, and the rate base estimate assumes that 250 megawatts are to be in service in 2019 and the remaining 250 megawatts in service in 2020. We are currently evaluating the bids from the wind suppliers and should have that selection by year-end to qualify for the 100% of the federal production tax credits.
Renewable energy is currently a meaningful part of our energy sources, including 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and approximately 730 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. The new Iowa Wind Project will lay up to 500 megawatts, which will place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for its customers.
We also plan to transfer the 100-megawatt Franklin County Wind Farm to IPL from Alliant Energy Resources and we'll file that request with FERC later this month. And for application that's approved by FERC, we will expect to transfer Franklin County to IPL during the first quarter of 2017.
We expect the investments we evaluated as part of our revenue requirement for the IPL rate case filing in the spring of 2017. The Franklin County Wind Farm will then be combined with its neighbor, IPL's Whispering Willow Wind Farm. In addition to IPL's additional 500-megawatt wind expansion and the planned transfer of the 100-megawatt Franklin County to IPL, we're exploring options for IPL and WPL to own and operate additional new wind generation. Our current estimated capital expenditures assume 400 megawatts of additional new wind generation, split evenly between IPL and WPL. But the final size and allocation between IPL and WPL is subject to change and further evaluation. 
Solar generation is also an expanding part of our balance generation portfolio as we continue to get an experience on it best integrated into the electric system. We now have several solar projects within our service territory, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill in Beloit at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We believe initiatives such as these as well as our announced solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future.
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.2 billion. Included in that is approximately $300 million for electric distribution system to continue to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $170 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year spending. And we've broke ground at the Riverside expansion in September. We expect the outfit from the Riverside expansion to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total interest paid to project cost remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected for the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines are GE Frame 7, one of the most efficient units in production. The coops have recently signed the letter of intent to acquire approximately 50 megawatts of Riverside, which is subject to PSCW approval. Once approved, the coop will start acquiring their share of the project during the construction phase. Also, the PSCW approved the revised operating plan to allow for WPL to increase its ownership share of Colombia, whereas WPS and MG&E will decrease their ownership share. In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generated facility is progressing well and is approximately 94% complete. Total capital expenditure for this project are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. Riverside and Emery, our chief primary assisting gas generation facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to last year. During the first 9 months of 2016, Emery is averaging 40% capacity factor and Riverside's average capacity factor exceeds 55%. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices and also at the flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days demonstrates the value of gas resources and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program through these emissions at our largest facilities. WPL's Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget earlier this year. Construction of the Colombia unit to SCR is approximately 35% complete and the total CapEx is anticipated to be $50 million and is expected to be in service in 2018.
There are several deregulations on the horizon dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate the work needed to comply with these rules and regulations and ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects are already underway in Iowa. In Wisconsin, the PSCW approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total cap expenditures for our water and ash program are anticipated to be over $155 million during the next 10 years and are included in our capital expenditure forecast and rate base projections.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We've made progress building a generation portfolio that is lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost effective. Their transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities and lower levels of coal generation to reduce economic dispatch, retirements and fuel switching.
We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
And I'm proud of the fact, we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WPL since 2011.
Let me summarize my key messages for today. We will continue to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide a 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend increased by 7% over 2016 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects includes completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, labor utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our community; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to thank him for his thoughtful leadership and being by my side during the past 5 years. The strong relationships he developed across our company, industry and investor community have made a difference for our customers, employees and share owners. I wish Tom and his family all the best as he transitions to a new phase in his life.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 20",626,"Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. 
We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. The nonrecurring $0.23 per share charges for the third quarter of this year relate to the asset valuation charges for the Franklin County Wind Farm. As Pat indicated, we seek FERC approval to transfer this asset to IPL and per Iowa administrative code, the transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. The current value of the Franklin County Wind Farm as of September 30, 2016, was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. When 2016 earnings guidance was issued in November 2015, we forecasted temperature normalized retail electric sales would increase 1% for the two utilities. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature normalized sales increased almost 1%. IPL sales are relatively flat year-over-year, whereas WP&L sales have exceeded 1% sales growth forecast.
The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth customer classes year-over-year in both utilities. The third quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our EPC earnings to reflect the recent FERC decision related to the first complaint and the anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the ROE levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. The reserve for the first complaint reflects on all-in ROE of 10.2% [ph] and the reserve for the second complaint reflects an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC ALJ's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June of this year. We are expecting a FERC decision by the second quarter of 2017 for the second complaint.
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. Since we are through 3 quarters of this year, we have narrowed the 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.84 to $1.92 per share, which leaves the middle point still at $1.88 per share, consistent with the guidance we issued in November 2015. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to remind you of a couple unusual negative drivers for the fourth quarter 2015 earnings. First, fourth quarter 2015 temperatures negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 per share on a post stock split basis. Also, we recorded additional reserves related to ATC in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the ALJ issued the opinion on the first MISO ROE complaint. And finally, timing of income taxes was a negative driver on the fourth quarter of 2015. These reminders should assist you with your estimation of the fourth quarter 2016 earnings.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. On this slide, we an estimate Alliant Energy consolidated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 4% lower than our effective tax rate guidance provided as part of the second quarter call. A reduction in the estimated effective tax rate with the consolidated entity is primarily the result of the Franklin County asset valuation charges recorded this quarter.
As I conclude my last earnings call remarks, I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to all the analysts, investors and employees. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know all of you. I'm very proud of how this company has evolved over the last 36 years and all of you have been instrumental in making this journey memorable and successful. Thank you. 
I will now turn the call over to Robert to review the financing plans and regulatory calendar."

Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan, this forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. We have completed the long term debt issuances for 2016, which included issuing long-term debt of $300 million at IPL and $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds were used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses.
Our 2017 financing plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust these plans as deem prudent, as market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and renewable investments in our capital expenditure plan. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and a combination of debt and new common equity. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL, consistent with the most recent retail base rate case decision.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. For IPL, our permit applications for the Clinton natural gas pipeline and the up to 500 megawatt Iowa wind investment have been improved. Later this quarter, we plan to file a request with FERC to transfer the Franklin County Wind Farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving a decision on this request prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in the spring of 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff. This filing includes new pricing options and an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1, 2017.
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during the year-end call. Typically, during the third quarter call, we provided our following year's earnings guidance. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year-end call next February.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. As Pat mentioned, the presentation for this event has been posted on our website this morning.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session."

With Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. We thank you for your service to our country and for protecting the freedom of people around the world. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families that support those on active duty as well as our veterans.
Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, narrowed our 2016 earnings guidance range and announced the 2017 common stock dividend target. That release also provided an updated annual capital expenditure plan through 2020 and our forecasted total CapEx for 2021 through 2025.
I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Warmer than normal winter temperatures lowered first quarter earnings, but the warmer summer increased third quarter earnings, resulting in a year-to-date temperature impact sales being close to normal. Therefore, temperature variances have had virtually no impact on our year-to-date earnings. So with summer behind us, we are narrowing our 2016 earnings guidance with the midpoint remaining at $1.88 per share, which is consistent with the earnings guidance provided in the November 15 on a post stock split basis. Tom will provide details for the quarter later in the call.
As we previously indicated, 2017 earnings guidance will be issued in conjunction with our year-end call in February. However, I am reaffirming that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%.
Yesterday, we also announced a 7% increase of our targeted 2017 common dividend to $1.26 per share. The 2017 dividend target payout ratio is consistent with our long-term target dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings.
We also issued our 2016 to 2020 updated capital expenditure plan totaling $6.6 billion as shown on Slide 2. 
In addition, on Slide 3, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 plan to our current plan. As you can see, the changes are driven primarily by additional renewable generation investments, offset partially with lower capital projects at other parts of the company. 
As you can see on Slide 4, we have provided a 10-year view of our forecasted capital expenditures. These investments in the first 5 years of the 10-year plan are higher than previously disclosed since we are accelerating our previously forecasted renewable investments for both IPL and WPL to take advantage of federal production tax credits. We are fortunate that we have the ability to serve our customers with economic renewable generation, which has the added benefit of providing stable fuel costs. As energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunities to better serve our customers. Our current plan does include additional generation needs beyond 2020, which we anticipate will be renewable, and natural gas generation investments. 
When reviewing Slide 4, it is also important to note that over 50% of the 10-year capital plan is projected to enhance electric and gas distribution systems. Customers and communities expect us to maintain reliability while creating a system that is increasingly interactive and dynamic. This includes making investments that accelerate the integration of new technologies, including distributor resources.
Also, for your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation that details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2020 as well as updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.
Now let me brief you on our current regulatory activities. Last month, we shared with you the settlement reached with the customer groups in Iowa relating to our advanced ratemaking principles filing associated with the proposed 500 megawatt New Wind Project in Iowa. I am pleased to report that last week, the IUB issued its order on the proposal in an expedited fashion. Details of the order include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission costs, a return equity of 11% to the life of the asset, and a depreciable life of 40 years. The New Wind Project is included in our capital expenditures and construction work in progress forecast, and the rate base estimate assumes that 250 megawatts are to be in service in 2019 and the remaining 250 megawatts in service in 2020. We are currently evaluating the bids from the wind suppliers and should have that selection by year-end to qualify for the 100% of the federal production tax credits.
Renewable energy is currently a meaningful part of our energy sources, including 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and approximately 730 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. The new Iowa Wind Project will lay up to 500 megawatts, which will place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for its customers.
We also plan to transfer the 100-megawatt Franklin County Wind Farm to IPL from Alliant Energy Resources and we'll file that request with FERC later this month. And for application that's approved by FERC, we will expect to transfer Franklin County to IPL during the first quarter of 2017.
We expect the investments we evaluated as part of our revenue requirement for the IPL rate case filing in the spring of 2017. The Franklin County Wind Farm will then be combined with its neighbor, IPL's Whispering Willow Wind Farm. In addition to IPL's additional 500-megawatt wind expansion and the planned transfer of the 100-megawatt Franklin County to IPL, we're exploring options for IPL and WPL to own and operate additional new wind generation. Our current estimated capital expenditures assume 400 megawatts of additional new wind generation, split evenly between IPL and WPL. But the final size and allocation between IPL and WPL is subject to change and further evaluation. 
Solar generation is also an expanding part of our balance generation portfolio as we continue to get an experience on our best integrated into the electric system. We now have several solar projects within our service territory, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill in Beloit at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We believe initiatives such as these as well as our announced solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future.
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.2 billion. Included in that is approximately $300 million for electric distribution system to continue to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $170 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year spending. And we've broke ground at the Riverside expansion in September. We expect the outfit from the Riverside expansion to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total interest paid to project cost remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected for the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines are GE Frame 7s, some of the most efficient units in production. The co-ops have recently signed the letter of intent to acquire approximately 50 megawatts of Riverside, which is subject to PSCW approval. Once approved, the co-ops will start acquiring their share of the project during the construction phase. Also, the PSCW approved the revised operating plan to allow for WPL to increase its ownership share of Colombia, whereas WPS and MG&E will decrease their ownership share. In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generated facility is progressing well and is approximately 94% complete. Total capital expenditure for this project are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary assisting gas generation facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to last year. During the first 9 months of 2016, Emery is averaging 40% capacity factor and Riverside's average capacity factor exceeds 55%. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices and also at the flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days demonstrates the value of gas resources and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. WPL's Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget earlier this year. Construction of the Columbia unit to SCR is approximately 35% complete and the total CapEx is anticipated to be $50 million and is expected to be in service in 2018.
There are several deregulations on the horizon dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate the work needed to comply with these rules and regulations and ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects are already underway in Iowa. In Wisconsin, the PSCW approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total cap expenditures for our water and ash program are anticipated to be over $155 million during the next 10 years and are included in our capital expenditure forecast and rate base projections.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We've made progress building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost effective. Their transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities and lower levels of coal generation to reduce economic dispatch, retirements and fuel switching.
We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
And I'm proud of the fact, we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WPL since 2011.
Let me summarize my key messages for today. We will continue to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide a 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend increased by 7% over 2016 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects includes completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our community; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to thank him for his thoughtful leadership and being by my side during the past 5 years. The strong relationships he developed across our company, industry and investor community have made a difference for our customers, employees and share owners. I wish Tom and his family all the best as he transitions to a new phase in his life.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 20",628,"Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. 
We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. The nonrecurring $0.23 per share charges for the third quarter of this year relate to the asset valuation charges for the Franklin County Wind Farm. As Pat indicated, we plan to seek FERC approval to transfer this asset to IPL and per Iowa administrative code, the transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. The current value of the Franklin County Wind Farm as of September 30, 2016, was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. When 2016 earnings guidance was issued in November 2015, we forecasted temperature normalized retail electric sales would increase 1% for the two utilities. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature normalized sales increased almost 1%. IPL sales are relatively flat year-over-year, whereas WP&L sales have exceeded 1% sales growth forecast.
The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth customer classes year-over-year in both utilities. The third quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect the recent FERC decision related to the first complaint and the anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the ROE levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. The reserve for the first complaint reflects on all-in ROE of 10.2% [ph] and the reserve for the second complaint reflects an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC ALJ's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June of this year. We are expecting a FERC decision by the second quarter of 2017 for the second complaint.
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. Since we are through 3 quarters of this year, we have narrowed the 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.84 to $1.92 per share, which leaves the middle point still at $1.88 per share, consistent with the guidance we issued in November 2015. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to remind you of a couple unusual negative drivers for the fourth quarter 2015 earnings. First, fourth quarter 2015 temperatures negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 per share on a post stock split basis. Also, we recorded additional reserves related to ATC in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the ALJ issued the opinion on the first MISO ROE complaint. And finally, timing of income taxes was a negative driver on the fourth quarter of 2015. These reminders should assist you with your estimation of the fourth quarter 2016 earnings.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. On this slide, we an estimate Alliant Energy consolidated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 4% lower than our effective tax rate guidance provided as part of the second quarter call. A reduction in the estimated effective tax rate with the consolidated entity is primarily the result of the Franklin County asset valuation charges recorded this quarter.
As I conclude my last earnings call remarks, I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to all the analysts, investors and employees. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know all of you. I'm very proud of how this company has evolved over the last 36 years and all of you have been instrumental in making this journey memorable and successful. Thank you. 
I will now turn the call over to Robert to review the financing plans and regulatory calendar."

Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan, this forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. We have completed the long term debt issuances for 2016, which included issuing long-term debt of $300 million at IPL and $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds were used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses.
Our 2017 financing plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust these plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and renewable investments in our capital expenditure plan. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and a combination of debt and new common equity. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL, consistent with the most recent retail base rate case decision.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. For IPL, our permit applications for the Clinton natural gas pipeline and the up to 500 megawatt Iowa wind investment have been improved. Later this quarter, we plan to file a request with FERC to transfer the Franklin County Wind Farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving a decision on this request prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in the spring of 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff. This filing includes new pricing options and an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1, 2017.
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during the year-end call. Typically, during the third quarter call, we provided our following year's earnings guidance. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year-end call next February.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. As Pat mentioned, the presentation for this event has been posted on our website this morning.

With Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. We thank you for your service to our country and for protecting the freedom of people around the world. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families that support those on active duty as well as our veterans.
Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, narrowed our 2016 earnings guidance range and announced the 2017 common stock dividend target. That release also provided an updated annual capital expenditure plan through 2020 and our forecasted total CapEx for 2021 through 2025.
I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Warmer than normal winter temperatures lowered first quarter earnings, but the warmer summer increased third quarter earnings, resulting in a year-to-date temperature impact sales being close to normal. Therefore, temperature variances have had virtually no impact on our year-to-date earnings. So with summer behind us, we are narrowing our 2016 earnings guidance with the midpoint remaining at $1.88 per share, which is consistent with the earnings guidance provided in the November 15 on a post stock split basis. Tom will provide details for the quarter later in the call.
As we previously indicated, 2017 earnings guidance will be issued in conjunction with our year-end call in February. However, I am reaffirming that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%.
Yesterday, we also announced a 7% increase of our targeted 2017 common dividend to $1.26 per share. The 2017 dividend target payout ratio is consistent with our long-term target dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings.
We also issued our 2016 to 2020 updated capital expenditure plan totaling $6.6 billion as shown on Slide 2. 
In addition, on Slide 3, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 plan to our current plan. As you can see, the changes are driven primarily by additional renewable generation investments, offset partially with lower capital projects at other parts of the company. 
As you can see on Slide 4, we have provided a 10-year view of our forecasted capital expenditures. These investments in the first 5 years of the 10-year plan are higher than previously disclosed since we are accelerating our previously forecasted renewable investments for both IPL and WPL to take advantage of federal production tax credits. We are fortunate that we have the ability to serve our customers with economic renewable generation, which has the added benefit of providing stable fuel costs. As energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunities to better serve our customers. Our current plan does include additional generation needs beyond 2020, which we anticipate will be renewable, and natural gas generation investments. 
When reviewing Slide 4, it is also important to note that over 50% of the 10-year capital plan is projected to enhance electric and gas distribution systems. Customers and communities expect us to maintain reliability while creating a system that is increasingly interactive and dynamic. This includes making investments that accelerate the integration of new technologies, including distributor resources.
Also, for your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation that details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2020 as well as updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.
Now let me brief you on our current regulatory activities. Last month, we shared with you the settlement reached with the customer groups in Iowa relating to our advanced ratemaking principles filing associated with the proposed 500 megawatt New Wind Project in Iowa. I am pleased to report that last week, the IUB issued its order on the proposal in an expedited fashion. Details of the order include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission costs, a return equity of 11% to the life of the asset, and a depreciable life of 40 years. The New Wind Project is included in our capital expenditures and construction work in progress forecast, and the rate base estimate assumes that 250 megawatts are to be in service in 2019 and the remaining 250 megawatts in service in 2020. We are currently evaluating the bids from the wind suppliers and should have that selection by year-end to qualify for the 100% of the federal production tax credits.
Renewable energy is currently a meaningful part of our energy sources, including 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and approximately 730 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. The new Iowa Wind Project will lay up to 500 megawatts, which will place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for its customers.
We also plan to transfer the 100-megawatt Franklin County Wind Farm to IPL from Alliant Energy Resources and we'll file that request with FERC later this month. And for application that's approved by FERC, we will expect to transfer Franklin County to IPL during the first quarter of 2017.
We expect the investments we evaluated as part of our revenue requirement for the IPL rate case filing in the spring of 2017. The Franklin County Wind Farm will then be combined with its neighbor, IPL's Whispering Willow Wind Farm. In addition to IPL's additional 500-megawatt wind expansion and the planned transfer of the 100-megawatt Franklin County to IPL, we're exploring options for IPL and WPL to own and operate additional new wind generation. Our current estimated capital expenditures assume 400 megawatts of additional new wind generation, split evenly between IPL and WPL. But the final size and allocation between IPL and WPL is subject to change and further evaluation. 
Solar generation is also an expanding part of our balance generation portfolio as we continue to get an experience on our best integrated into the electric system. We now have several solar projects within our service territory, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill in Beloit at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We believe initiatives such as these as well as our announced solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future.
Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities, with forecasted investments of over $1.2 billion. Included in that is approximately $300 million for electric distribution system to continue to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $170 million for improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year spending. And we've broke ground at the Riverside expansion in September. We expect the outfit from the Riverside expansion to be approximately 700 megawatts and the total interest paid to project cost remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected for the engineering, procurement and construction and the combustion turbines are GE Frame 7s, some of the most efficient units in production. The co-ops have recently signed the letter of intent to acquire approximately 50 megawatts of Riverside, which is subject to PSCW approval. Once approved, the co-ops will start acquiring their share of the project during the construction phase. Also, the PSCW approved the revised operating plan to allow for WPL to increase its ownership share of Colombia, whereas WPS and MG&E will decrease their ownership share. In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas fired generated facility is progressing well and is approximately 94% complete. Total capital expenditure for this project are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. Riverside and Emery, our 2 primary assisting gas generation facilities, continue to experience increased dispatch when compared to last year. During the first 9 months of 2016, Emery is averaging 40% capacity factor and Riverside's average capacity factor exceeds 55%. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices and also at the flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days demonstrates the value of gas resources and our balanced energy mix. 
Moving to our existing coal fleet. We're nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. WPL's Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget earlier this year. Construction of the Columbia unit to SCR is approximately 35% complete and the total CapEx is anticipated to be $50 million and is expected to be in service in 2018.
There are several deregulations on the horizon dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate the work needed to comply with these rules and regulations and ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects are already underway in Iowa. In Wisconsin, the PSCW approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total cap expenditures for our water and ash program are anticipated to be over $155 million during the next 10 years and are included in our capital expenditure forecast and rate base projections.
During the past few years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We've made progress building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost effective. Their transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities and lower levels of coal generation to reduce economic dispatch, retirements and fuel switching.
We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements.
And I'm proud of the fact, we've accomplished all that while holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WPL since 2011.
Let me summarize my key messages for today. We will continue to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide a 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend increased by 7% over 2016 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects includes completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our community; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to thank him for his thoughtful leadership and being by my side during the past 5 years. The strong relationships he developed across our company, industry and investor community have made a difference for our customers, employees and share owners. I wish Tom and his family all the best as he transitions to a new phase in his life.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 20",628,"Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. 
We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. The nonrecurring $0.23 per share charges for the third quarter of this year relate to the asset valuation charges for the Franklin County Wind Farm. As Pat indicated, we plan to seek FERC approval to transfer this asset to IPL and per Iowa administrative code, the transfer must be made at the lower of cost to market. The current value of the Franklin County Wind Farm as of September 30, 2016, was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. When 2016 earnings guidance was issued in November 2015, we forecasted temperature normalized retail electric sales would increase 1% for the two utilities. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature normalized sales increased almost 1%. IPL sales are relatively flat year-over-year, whereas WP&L sales have exceeded 1% sales growth forecast.
The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth customer classes year-over-year in both utilities. The third quarter 2016 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect the recent FERC decision related to the first complaint and the anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the ROE levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. The reserve for the first complaint reflects on all-in ROE of 10.2% [ph] and the reserve for the second complaint reflects an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC ALJ's initial decision on the second complaint issued in June of this year. We are expecting a FERC decision by the second quarter of 2017 for the second complaint.
Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. Since we are through 3 quarters of this year, we have narrowed the 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.84 to $1.92 per share, which leaves the middle point still at $1.88 per share, consistent with the guidance we issued in November 2015. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to remind you of a couple unusual negative drivers for the fourth quarter 2015 earnings. First, fourth quarter 2015 temperatures negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 per share on a post stock split basis. Also, we recorded additional reserves related to ATC in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the ALJ issued the opinion on the first MISO ROE complaint. And finally, timing of income taxes was a negative driver on the fourth quarter of 2015. These reminders should assist you with your estimation of the fourth quarter 2016 earnings.
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. On this slide, we an estimate Alliant Energy consolidated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 4% lower than our effective tax rate guidance provided as part of the second quarter call. A reduction in the estimated effective tax rate with the consolidated entity is primarily the result of the Franklin County asset valuation charges recorded this quarter.
As I conclude my last earnings call remarks, I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to all the analysts, investors and employees. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know all of you. I'm very proud of how this company has evolved over the last 36 years and all of you have been instrumental in making this journey memorable and successful. Thank you. 
I will now turn the call over to Robert to review the financing plans and regulatory calendar."

Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019.

Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan, this forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit rating.
Our 2016 financing plan assumes we will issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan. We have completed the long term debt issuances for 2016, which included issuing long-term debt of $300 million at IPL and $500 million at our nonregulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds were used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and nonregulated businesses.
Our 2017 financing plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust these plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and renewable investments in our capital expenditure plan. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and a combination of debt and new common equity. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL, consistent with the most recent retail base rate case decision.
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. For IPL, our permit applications for the Clinton natural gas pipeline and the up to 500 megawatt Iowa wind investment have been improved. Later this quarter, we plan to file a request with FERC to transfer the Franklin County Wind Farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving a decision on this request prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in the spring of 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff. This filing includes new pricing options and an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1, 2017.
Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during the year-end call. Typically, during the third quarter call, we provided our following year's earnings guidance. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year-end call next February.
