Thanks for joining us. We have very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion and we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever.",315,"Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We have very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion and we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever. About 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still -- while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year. Some key drivers for the year. 
Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal '16 up 4.4% to $623 million and EPS up 11% to $3.03. 
Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of a 0 to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million. 
For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion, and total used units grew by 4%. Our total Web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. 
Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share. While in the previous year's fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalize interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share. 
I will now turn it over to Tom Reedy to give you some details around CAF. Tom?"

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter. 
For the quarter, charge-offs and the loss provision realigned with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year's fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year's fourth quarter. 
CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year's fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores where we continue to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end. 
Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year toto $1.3 billion, that's due to combination of a growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was similar to last year, 0.7% versus 0.6% of the sales in the prior year. 
As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5%, as CarMax's overall Tier 3 sales. 
Tier 3 financing, as a percent of sales, was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, largely due to the reduced volume of lower credit applications I mentioned earlier. 
In Q4, we continue to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares. And since inception of the program, we repurchased 46.4 million shares. At the end of FY '16, we had 1.4 billion remaining under the current authorization. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill."

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Mid-size, large SUVs and trucks, as a percentage of sales, were flat approximately 24% in both this year and last year's fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense. 
During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores, 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Furia, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco. 
Before I turn it back over to Tom, want to take a minute to talk about how it's an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn't be more proud of the progress that we made. I store base has grown to 158 stores, and as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. 
Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service and we have a world-class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017, while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan. But we are never satisfied. And for those of you have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case. 
For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how we want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visit came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they've always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign, and we expect that will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to assess different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers needs. We're also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient and reducing waste throughout the company. 
We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you 2 quick examples of enhancements that we're developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember, we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year. And this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies removing the millions of vehicles we ship annually. It is this kind of continuos improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future. Tom?"

And that allows us to be able to deliver an exceptional value to the customer. And some of what I talked about last quarter, we talked some big SUVs are a little expensive, so we didn't buy them. We didn't buy as many. And that allows us to match our margin, I think, very efficiently. We transport cars customers. It's about 1/3 of results. So that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We're big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of product all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that's reflected in the ultimate margin that we achieved and the sales that we get. So I'm very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp based on one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along. I think we're better at managing our inventory and our margin so that we were a few years ago. And with continued use of external and internal data and training and development of the process, I think we'll just continue to get better at it.

But we sold more used cars during the year then the next 4 competitors combined. So I feel like our consumer offering is clearly resonating with consumers and we're able to grow our business year after year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% by the full year, very good number for a company of our size. And I think, given the choice, consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealer's total for the year, used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers. And I think you have to look at it on a broader scale and not just focus on the publicly traded auto retailers because they are very small sliver of used car sales in the U.S."

And also, as a percent of our opening, I mean, as a percent of our stores that we're opening each year, the last few years that number actually going down because we've been consistent at that '14, '15 number. So this year, the amount of stores we opened as a percentage of the base has gone down. So you expect the percentage of units delivered from the new stores to go down. Unless we increase the number of stores that we build and we change the profile of the size, what I would tell you is that we're continuing to open stores because they're delivering a great return. And remember that we have very long models for sales, 30 plus years. And we have some stores -- we have a whole batch of stores now that are less than 5 results and are still on their growth curve. So we're pleased to the performance of the new stores, that's why we keep opening them and we think they're delivering a great return.

That's where we need to make sure that we meet them however they want to be met. And we want to make sure that they have the capabilities to do parts of the transaction or all of the transaction online. I will tell you that the average customer at CarMax has a trade in. The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity. And it's not as easy to do a $20,000 transaction that is multifaceted, which oftentimes includes appraising the car that they're driving and do the entire transaction online. I'm not saying that we won't do that, and we won't have those capabilities. But that's a sliver of the customers that we actually deal with. And what we're really, really good at in our sources helping people find the right car that they need and the budget that they can afford, matching them up with a quiet credit offer, making sure we give them a fair offer for their trade in, which almost always requires looking at a car and making a fair offer after you've assessed its condition. So we are going to continue to drive towards giving the consumer more and more capability to do whatever they want to do online. And it may someday include consummating the whole transaction.

I wanted to ask you about gross profit per unit. So at my family's dealerships, we're going to do over 5,000 used card this year. i can tell you, if you pick up the phone and you call anybody at their dealerships today, they would look forward to or be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They'd be very pleased because that means our costs for goods sold will go down. Therefore, the gross profit will likely go up because of spread between new cars prices and used car prices would increase and the volume will go up because of simply price elasticity demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that for some reason, my question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though during periods of time, when gross or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which is kind of doubted what happens with our leadership. And I'm wondering, do you have any idea or first of all, what's your sense our was going to happen tier gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim index goes down?

So you could bar you with our when our ability to buy a car is cheaper, we have chosen to pass those savings onto our customers as opposed to taking it into margin. That's just what we've done. The biggest example I can give you is during the recession, our average retail price dropped by over $2,000 in 3 months, and we kept our margins and we bought cars cheaper over that period of time by that same amount, and we chose to keep our margins flat. That's just a decision that we made. I think we gave a whole bunch of customers a great deal and hopefully, made customers alike. That's how we've chosen to run our business.

I think to use the word optimal is the way I would go, and I'm not really sure what that is. I will tell you, I don't know we get your data, but we've never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I'm not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There's 40 million cars sold annually, roughly 1/3 are sold from customer to customer. And it's very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult. As big as we are, and I know that some of those numbers earlier, we are a tiny share of 0 to 10-year-old cars nationally, somewhere in the 2% range. So I don't know that focusing on share is the right place to spend your energy because it's so difficult to ascertain what share actually is. And again, the business is so fragmented, you could be as big as we are and have just affectional share. Even in the markets that we're in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it's around 5. But remember, too, that for us, we still select out of a bunch of inventory that's included in the denominator. We don't retail anything over 120,000 miles. So there's a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them and we sell them through our auction. That doesn't count a share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don't count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So we're evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth. So it's very good question. But there's such fragmentation. I don't know really know how to think about it. So we're trying to optimize our sales. We're trying to grow our business.

Some of the smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory. And while actually you're taking any ownership of the inventor we actually do think have 50,000 online is a huge advantage for us in providing great selection for customers and a multifaceted customers when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can't quite afford the car that they thought.

We had a very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion. And we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever, about 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still -- while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year. Some key drivers for the year: Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income, up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal '16, up 4.4% to $623 million; and EPS, up 11% to $3.03. Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that, for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continued to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million.
For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion. And total used units grew by 4%. Our total web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million, and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share, while in the previous year's fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalized interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter. For the quarter, charge-offs and loss provision were in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year's fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year's fourth quarter.
CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year's fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores, where we continued to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. That's due to a combination of the growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was similar to last year, 0.7% versus 0.6% of sales in the prior year. As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5% of CarMax' overall Tier 3 sales. Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, largely due to the reduced volume of lower-credit applications I mentioned earlier. In Q4, we continued to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares. And since inception of the program, we've repurchased 46.4 million shares. At the end of FY '16, we had 1.4 billion remaining under the current authorization.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Mid-size, large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales were flat, approximately 24% in both this year and last year's fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores. 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Peoria, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco.
Before I turn it back over to Tom, I want to take a minute to talk about how it's an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made. Our store base has grown to 158 stores. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service, and we have a world-class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017 while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan. But we are never satisfied, and for those of you who have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case.
For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how they want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visits came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they've always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign, and we expect it will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers' needs. We're also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient in reducing waste throughout the company. We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you 2 quick examples of enhancements that we're developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year, and this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles that we ship annually. It is this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future.

And that allows us to be able to deliver an exceptional value to the customer. And some of what I talked about last quarter of -- we thought some big SUVs were a little expensive, so we didn't buy them. Or we didn't buy as many. And that allows us to manage our margin, I think, very efficiently. We transport cars our customers request. It's about 1/3 of our sales, so that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We're big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of products all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that's reflected in the ultimate margins that we achieve and the sales that we get. So I'm very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp based on one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along. I think we're better at managing our inventory and our margins now than we were a few years ago. And with continued use of external and internal data and training and development of the process, I think we'll just continue to get better at it. So I'm pretty pleased with the progress that we've made and the results we've been able to deliver."

There are many more franchise deals, as you know, but we sold more used cars during the year than the next 4 competitors combined, so I feel like our consumer offer is clearly resonating with consumers. And we're able to grow our business year after year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% for the full year, a very good number for a company of our size. And I think, given the choice, consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealers' total for the year: Used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers. And I think you have to look at it on a broader scale and not just focus on the publicly traded auto retailers because they're a very small sliver of used car sales in the U.S."

And we're very happy to be able to deliver a great consumer experience and a high-quality car to those customers. But if you look at a base from which to grow your business, if you had a little higher credit profile, it's not the worst thing. You've been around long enough to know that, that percent of sales for us was at one point nonexistent. And it's gone from 2% to, I think, as high in 1 year as 19%. It might have been our highest full year. So we're down a couple points for the year. You could argue that, that loss of credit apps, of volume of apps hurts comps by a little bit, which it does but it doesn't hurt profits by as much as it hurts the comp.

The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity.

So at my family's dealerships, we're going to do over 5,000 used cars this year. I can tell you, if you picked up the phone and you called anybody at our dealerships today, they would look forward to or be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They'd be very pleased because that means our costs for goods sold would go down. Therefore, the gross profit would likely go up because the spread between new car prices and used car prices would increase, and the volume will go up because of simple price elasticity of demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that, for some reason -- I'm not [indiscernible]. My question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that, if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though, during periods of time when gross -- or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which just kind of countered what happens at our dealerships. And I'm wondering, do you have any idea -- or first of all, what's your sense of what's going to happen to your gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim Index goes down? And then secondly, can you explain what appears, at least to my mind, to be a bit of an anomaly that took place kind of in that -- before the last downturn?"

have been very consistent. When the Manheim Index goes down and we can buy cars cheaper, we want to give our customers a better deal. So we have chosen, whether it's right or wrong, to not increase our margins when our prices go down because we want to give our customers a better deal, and we're building our business over a very, very long period of time and we want them to leave and say, ""Why, I got a really fantastic deal. The next time I buy a car, I want to buy it from CarMax "" So you can argue with our motives, but when our ability to buy a car is cheaper, we have chosen to pass those savings onto our customers as opposed to taking it into margin. That's just what we've done. The biggest example I can give you is during the recession, our average retail price dropped by over $2,000 in 3 months, and we kept our margins and we bought cars cheaper over that period of time by that same amount, and we chose to keep our margins flat. That's just a decision that we made. I think we gave a whole bunch of customers a great deal, and hopefully, made customers for life. That's how we've chosen to run our business. It doesn't mean that we'll do it exactly that way going forward. But when we have the ability to buy cars cheaper, we pass those savings onto our customers."

I will tell you, I don't know where you get your data, but we've never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I'm not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There's 40 million cars sold annually, roughly 1/3 are sold from customer to customer, and it's very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult.

And again, the business is so fragmented, you could be as big as we are and have just a fractional share. Even in the markets that we're in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it's around 5. But remember too that, for us, we still select out of a bunch of inventory that's included in the denominator. We don't retail anything over 120,000 miles. So there's a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them, and we sell them through our auction. That doesn't count a share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don't count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So we're evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth.

When we think about the retail inventory channel, it looks like you probably saw it as much of auctions as you do through in-store appraiser, but the auction channel being a lot -- relatively a lot less profitable.

So I can't give you an exact answer, but what I can tell you is our percent of cars that we sell that we retail, which we call self-sufficiency, has been in the low-30s, and it's been as high as, I think, the low-50s, and it moves around over time, depending on a whole bunch of different variables. And what we've gotten, I think, pretty good at is being able to manage our margins despite the fact that we expect some movement there. So I can't predict exactly what's going to happen when leases -- when lease volumes at the auction pick up, but that's not just lease volumes at the auction. Remember, it's all these cars coming back into the marketplace in a number of different ways."

Anything that we see anybody doing that we think would benefit our customers, we're going to evaluate whether or not it makes sense for us. As I mentioned earlier, the one thing to remember is many, many, many transactions involve the acquisition of the customer's existing car, something we're very, very good at, and I think it gives us a competitive advantage. Some of these smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory. And while -- as you're taking any ownership of the inventory, we actually think have 50,000 online is a huge advantage for us in providing a great selection for customers in a multifaceted selection when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can't quite afford the car that they thought.

We had a very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion. And we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever, about 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still -- while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year. Some key drivers for the year: Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income, up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal '16, up 4.4% to $623 million; and EPS, up 11% to $3.03. Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that, for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continued to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million.
For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion. And total used units grew by 4%. Our total web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million, and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share, while in the previous year's fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalized interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share.
I'll now turn it over to Tom Reedy to give you some details around CAF. Tom?"

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter. For the quarter, charge-offs and loss provision were in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year's fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year's fourth quarter.
CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year's fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores, where we continued to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. That's due to a combination of the growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was similar to last year, 0.7% versus 0.6% of sales in the prior year. As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5% of CarMax' overall Tier 3 sales. Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, largely due to the reduced volume of lower-credit applications I mentioned earlier. In Q4, we continued to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares. And since inception of the program, we've repurchased 46.4 million shares. At the end of FY '16, we had 1.4 billion remaining under the current authorization.

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Mid-size, large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales were flat, approximately 24% in both this year and last year's fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores. 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Peoria, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco.
Before I turn it back over to Tom, I want to take a minute to talk about how it's an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made. Our store base has grown to 158 stores. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service, and we have a world-class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017 while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan. But we are never satisfied, and for those of you who have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case.
For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how they want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visits came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they've always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign, and we expect it will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers' needs. We're also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient in reducing waste throughout the company. We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you 2 quick examples of enhancements that we're developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year, and this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles that we ship annually. It is this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future.

And some of what I talked about last quarter of -- we thought some big SUVs were a little expensive, so we didn't buy them. Or we didn't buy as many. And that allows us to manage our margin, I think, very efficiently. We transfer cars at customer request. It's about 1/3 of our sales, so that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We're big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of products all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that's reflected in the ultimate margins that we achieve and the sales that we get. So I'm very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp facing one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along. I think we're better at managing our inventory and our margins now than we were a few years ago.

There are many more franchise deals, as you know, but we sold more used cars during the year than the next 4 competitors combined, so I feel like our consumer offer is clearly resonating with consumers. And we're able to grow our business year after year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% for the full year, a very good number for a company of our size. And I think, given the choice, consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealers' total for the year: Used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers.

And we're very happy to be able to deliver a great consumer experience and a high-quality car to those customers. But if you look at a base from which to grow your business, if you had a little higher credit profile, it's not the worst thing. You've been around long enough to know that, that percent of sales for us was at one point nonexistent. And it's gone from 2% to, I think, as high in 1 year as 19%. It might have been our highest full year. So we're down a couple points for the year. You could argue that, that loss of credit apps, of volume of apps hurts comps by a little bit, which it does but it doesn't hurt profits by as much as it hurts the comp. So we continue to build our brand. We continue to advertise to get any consumer to want to come to CarMax, but it's not that bad if it shifts a couple of points in the other direction.

One is to drive just raw traffic, and the other one is to improve the likelihood of the traffic that shows up to buy a car. So if a customer -- as Bill mentioned, if a customer wants to do more of the process from home, they have those tools available on our website. They can be more prepared when they show up. And to be honest with you, it doesn't matter to us whether we get a few less customers who are a lot more likely to buy or more customers that are just as equally likely to buy. So it's very difficult to measure that, but it's kind of a multifaceted goal with the website. It's people are doing a lot of research online. There's a lot of data out there that's telling you that people are visiting less stores than they used to before they buy a car, so it's really, really important that our website provides a great education for the customer. And when they show up, they're more likely to buy. So that's kind of a goal of the website. It's to educate and then to deliver customers to the store, and hopefully, they're more likely to buy."

And we want to make sure that they have the capabilities to do parts of the transaction or all of the transaction online. I will tell you that the average customer at CarMax has a trade-in. The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity. And it's not as easy to do a $20,000 transaction that is multifaceted, which oftentimes includes appraising the car that they're driving; and do the entire transaction online. I'm not saying that we won't do that and we won't have those capabilities, but that's a sliver of the customers that we actually deal with. And what we've -- we're really, really good at in our stores is helping people find the right car that they need in the budget that they can afford; matching them up with the right credit offer; making sure we give them a fair offer for their trade-in, which almost always requires looking at the car and making a fair offer after you've assessed its condition. So we are going to continue to drive towards giving the consumer more and more capability to do whatever they want to do online. And it may someday include consummating the whole transaction, but there is a large segment of customers who really can't do the whole transaction online due to those other pieces that I mentioned."

So at my family's dealerships, we're going to do over 5,000 used cars this year. I can tell you, if you picked up the phone and you called anybody at our dealerships today, they would look forward to or be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They'd be very pleased because that means our costs for goods sold would go down. Therefore, the gross profit would likely go up because the spread between new car prices and used car prices would increase, and the volume will go up because of simple price elasticity of demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that, for some reason -- I'm not [indiscernible]. My question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that, if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though, during periods of time when gross -- or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which just kind of countered what happens at our dealerships. And I'm wondering, do you have any idea -- or first of all, what's your sense of what's going to happen to your gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim Index goes down?

And if you're asking about CAF portfolio, there's nothing going on there that we see that caused us any concern, and it's been pretty much business as usual. With regard to the partners, there's a reason we have a number of them because we want to keep a broad spectrum of credit available to our customers. We continue to see greater than 90% of customers who submit an application and get some kind of approval in our stores. So the way I would characterize, it's greater than 90%. The way I would characterize our availability through the fourth quarter is as good as ever. And as Tom mentioned, we pick a long-term perspective with our partners. We try to be a good partner. We believe we've developed an origination channel that is superior to others as far as originating loans for new cars, for used cars and new cars due to the transparency and the integrity of the channel. It's proven out in the past that our partners have seen better performance on their pool originating out of CarMax than elsewhere. We've seen in the past that they preferred to allocate capital to us when times have gotten tough. And as we look forward, we would hope that our work and our long-term relationships and the integrity of the channel would make it such that we continue to see that kind of preference for CarMax."

I think to use the word optimal is the way I would go, and I'm not really sure what that is. I will tell you, I don't know where you get your data, but we've never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I'm not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There's 40 million cars sold annually, roughly 1/3 are sold from customer to customer, and it's very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult. As big as we are, and I noted some of those numbers earlier, we are a tiny share of 0 to 10-year-old cars nationally, somewhere in the 2% range. So I don't know that focusing on share is the right place to spend your energy because it's so difficult to ascertain what share actually is. And again, the business is so fragmented, you could be as big as we are and have just a fractional share. Even in the markets that we're in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it's around 5. But remember too that, for us, we self-select out of a bunch of inventory that's included in the denominator. We don't retail anything over 120,000 miles. So there's a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them, and we sell them through our auction. That doesn't count as share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don't count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So we're evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth. So it's a very good question, but there's such fragmentation. I don't know really know how to think about it. We're just trying to optimize our sales. We're trying to grow our business. We're trying to comp our stores and deliver a great return for our shareholders."

Some of these smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory. And while -- without taking any ownership of the inventory, we actually think have 50,000 online is a huge advantage for us in providing a great selection for customers in a multifaceted selection when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can't quite afford the car that they thought.

We had a very solid year in fiscal 2016, where total revenues grew to more than $15 billion. And we sold over 1 million vehicles total both in retail and wholesale for the first time ever, about 620,000 used cars and about 395,000 wholesale cars, while still -- while also delivering double-digit EPS growth for the year. Some key drivers for the year: Used unit comps increased by 2.4%. Total used units grew a little over 6.5%. Wholesale units grew by 4.9%. CAF income, up 6.7% to more than $392 million. Net income for fiscal '16, up 4.4% to $623 million; and EPS, up 11% to $3.03. Proceeds from our legal settlement benefited our fiscal 2015 net income by $12.9 million or $0.06 a share. Our data for the year indicates that, for calendar year 2015, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year-old used vehicles by approximately 1%. And we continued to focus on returning value to our shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During the year, we bought back 16.3 million shares at a cost of $971 million.
For the fourth quarter, used unit comps increased by 0.7%, driven by an improvement in conversion. And total used units grew by 4%. Our total web traffic increased by 11%. Total wholesale units, up 2.3%. CAF quarterly income grew by 2.2% to $92 million. Net income for the fourth quarter declined by 1.5% to $141 million, and EPS rose 6% to $0.71 a share. Remember that the impairment-related charge in this quarter reduced our net income by $5.2 million or $0.03 a share, while in the previous year's fourth quarter, net income was increased by the adjustment to capitalized interest expense of $4.2 million or $0.02 a share.

As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and average managed receivables grew by 14% to $9.5 billion. For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year and 6% last quarter. For the quarter, charge-offs and loss provision were in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase in loss provision reflects both the favorability we commented on in last year's fourth quarter and the growth in receivables. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $95 million was 0.99% of managed receivables compared to 0.97% in last year's fourth quarter.
CAF net penetration was 41.7% compared to 40.9% in last year's fourth quarter. This increase reflects the mix of applications in the stores, where we continued to see growth at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less volume at the lower end. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. That's due to a combination of the growth in CarMax sales and our higher penetration at CAF. Percent of CAF penetration attributable to our subprime test was similar to last year, 0.7% versus 0.6% of sales in the prior year. As mentioned in the press release, we are comfortable and plan to continue to originate these loans at the same pace, a targeted volume of 5% of CarMax' overall Tier 3 sales. Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales was 15.1% compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, largely due to the reduced volume of lower-credit applications I mentioned earlier. In Q4, we continued to experience a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of the credit spectrum and moderate growth at the high end.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for about $156 million. For the fiscal year, as Tom said, we repurchased 16.3 million shares.

Mid-size, large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales were",573,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone.
As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles increased to approximately 77% compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. Mid-size, large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales were flat, approximately 24% in both this year and last year's fourth quarter, which is up slightly from 23% in the third quarter. SG&A for the fourth quarter increased about 1% to $334 million. This growth reflects the 10% or 15-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, largely offset by a decrease of $14 million or $97 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 5 stores. 3 were in new markets, 2 in Boston and 1 in Peoria, Illinois. We also opened our sixth store in Atlanta and a third store in St. Louis. In the first quarter, we expect to open 2 new stores in new markets, Springfield, Illinois and our first store in San Francisco.
Before I turn it back over to Tom, I want to take a minute to talk about how it's an exciting time for CarMax. Looking back over the past 23 years, we couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made. Our store base has grown to 158 stores. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we sold over 1 million vehicles this fiscal year for the first time ever. Our customers continue to give us high marks for excellent customer service, and we have a world-class culture. We continue to execute our growth plan and currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017 while also focusing on returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan. But we are never satisfied, and for those of you who have followed us for a long time, you know that this is the case.
For our customers, we have to be able to meet them where and how they want to do business. Nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to the purchase. And by the end of fiscal 2016, over half of our total visits came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We need to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they've always received in our store. We are currently in the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign, and we expect it will be fully rolled out by the end of this month. We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers' needs. We're also never satisfied with our execution. We will continue to focus on becoming more efficient in reducing waste throughout the company. We will continue to equip our associates with the tools that they need to make their job easier. Let me give you 2 quick examples of enhancements that we're developing. One is a mobile appraisal platform. Remember we appraise more than 2 million vehicles a year, and this will help our buyers reduce our appraisal time and increase accuracy. Another example is an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles that we ship annually. It is this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future.

And some of what I talked about last quarter of -- we thought some big SUVs were a little expensive, so we didn't buy them. Or we didn't buy as many. And that allows us to manage our margin, I think, very efficiently. We transfer cars at customer request. It's about 1/3 of our sales, so that allows us to turn our inventory quickly. I think our turns help us manage our margins pretty well. And it also allows us to continue to test the margin variability. We're big enough now that we can test pockets and markets and different types of products all across the country and learn a lot about price elasticity. And then that's reflected in the ultimate margins that we achieve and the sales that we get. So I'm very pleased with the quarter and with the results and a positive comp facing one of our tougher comparisons last year. And yes, I think we can get better at this as time goes along.

There are many more franchise deals, as you know, but we sold more used cars during the year than the next 4 competitors combined, so I feel like our consumer offer is clearly resonating with consumers. And we're able to grow our business year after year. We once again comped our stores by 2.5% for the full year, a very good number for a company of our size. And I think, given the choice, consumers still, after they shop around, pick us more often than not. So I think the results speak for themselves. If you look at franchise dealers' total for the year: Used car sales were up by 2% across all the franchise dealers. And I think you have to look at it on a broader scale and not just focus on the publicly traded auto retailers because they're a very small sliver of used car sales in the U.S."

And we're very happy to be able to deliver a great consumer experience and a high-quality car to those customers. But if you look at a base from which to grow your business, if you had a little higher credit profile, it's not the worst thing. You've been around long enough to know that, that percent of sales for us was at one point nonexistent. And it's gone from 2% to, I think, as high in 1 year as 19%. It might have been our highest full year. So we're down a couple points for the year. You could argue that, that loss of credit apps, of volume of apps hurts comps by a little bit, which it does but it doesn't hurt profits by as much as it hurts the comp. So we continue to build our brand. We continue to advertise to get any consumer to want to come to CarMax, but it's not that bad if it shifts a couple of points in the other direction.

And to be honest with you, it doesn't matter to us whether we get a few less customers who are a lot more likely to buy or more customers that are just as equally likely to buy. So it's very difficult to measure that, but it's kind of a multifaceted goal with the website. It's people are doing a lot of research online. There's a lot of data out there that's telling you that people are visiting less stores than they used to before they buy a car, so it's really, really important that our website provides a great education for the customer.

So if you look at where we're spending our dollars, there's no doubt it's shifting towards mobile. It's shifting towards the website because that's where our customers are. That's where we need to make sure that we meet them however they want to be met. And we want to make sure that they have the capabilities to do parts of the transaction or all of the transaction online. I will tell you that the average customer at CarMax has a trade-in. The average customer at CarMax needs a loan, has to go through a finance process, sometimes has negative equity. And it's not as easy to do a $20,000 transaction that is multifaceted, which oftentimes includes appraising the car that they're driving; and do the entire transaction online. I'm not saying that we won't do that and we won't have those capabilities, but that's a sliver of the customers that we actually deal with. And what we've -- we're really, really good at in our stores is helping people find the right car that they need in the budget that they can afford; matching them up with the right credit offer; making sure we give them a fair offer for their trade-in, which almost always requires looking at the car and making a fair offer after you've assessed its condition. So we are going to continue to drive towards giving the consumer more and more capability to do whatever they want to do online. And it may someday include consummating the whole transaction, but there is a large segment of customers who really can't do the whole transaction online due to those other pieces that I mentioned."

So at my family's dealerships, we're going to do over 5,000 used cars this year. I can tell you, if you picked up the phone and you called anybody at our dealerships today, they would look forward to or be very pleased if the Manheim Index went down. They'd be very pleased because that means our costs for goods sold would go down. Therefore, the gross profit would likely go up because the spread between new car prices and used car prices would increase, and the volume will go up because of simple price elasticity of demand. And so higher gross profit, higher volume equals better total gross profit. That is a simple idea, simple argument that, for some reason -- I'm not [indiscernible]. My question to you is the only thing that kind of argues against that is that, if I look back at your results historically, it appears as though, during periods of time when gross -- or when the Manheim Index inflected somewhat, your gross profit per unit actually went down a little bit, which just kind of countered what happens at our dealerships. And I'm wondering, do you have any idea -- or first of all, what's your sense of what's going to happen to your gross profit per unit and your volume when the Manheim Index or if the Manheim Index goes down? And then secondly, can you explain what appears, at least to my mind, to be a bit of an anomaly that took place kind of in that -- before the last downturn?"

That's just what we've done. The biggest example I can give you is during the recession, our average retail price dropped by over $2,000 in 3 months, and we kept our margins -- and we bought cars cheaper over that period of time by that same amount, and we chose to keep our margins flat. That's just a decision that we made. I think we gave a whole bunch of customers a great deal, and hopefully, made customers for life. That's how we've chosen to run our business.

I think to use the word optimal is the way I would go, and I'm not really sure what that is. I will tell you, I don't know where you get your data, but we've never been able to get market share data that was accurate on any short-term window of time. I'm not even sure how accurate it is over a longer period of time. It is so fragmented nationally. There's 40 million cars sold annually, roughly 1/3 are sold from customer to customer, and it's very challenging to figure out share. I think just the fragmentation alone makes it very, very difficult. As big as we are, and I noted some of those numbers earlier, we are a tiny share of 0 to 10-year-old cars nationally, somewhere in the 2% range. So I don't know that focusing on share is the right place to spend your energy because it's so difficult to ascertain what share actually is. And again, the business is so fragmented, you could be as big as we are and have just a fractional share. Even in the markets that we're in of 0 to 10-year-old cars, we think it's around 5. But remember too that, for us, we self-select out of a bunch of inventory that's included in the denominator. We don't retail anything over 120,000 miles. So there's a lot of cars that are 0 to 10-year-old over 120,000 miles. We still make an offer on those cars. We buy them, and we sell them through our auction. That doesn't count as share. But we sold 400,000 cars last year that don't count in share. They just happen to go through our auctions. So we're evaluating how to think about this going forward, Seth. So it's a very good question, but there's such fragmentation. I don't know really know how to think about it. We're just trying to optimize our sales. We're trying to grow our business. We're trying to comp our stores and deliver a great return for our shareholders."

And what we've gotten, I think, pretty good at is being able to manage our margins despite the fact that we expect some movement there.

Anything that we see anybody doing that we think would benefit our customers, we're going to evaluate whether or not it makes sense for us.

Some of these smaller online players are connecting consumer to consumer without actually taking any of the inventory. And while -- without taking any ownership of the inventory, we actually think have 50,000 online is a huge advantage for us in providing a great selection for customers in a multifaceted selection when they get into their finance options and find out maybe that they can't quite afford the car that they thought.

But in terms of value engineering our store, so that they're both as efficient to build as possible, and then as efficient to run as possible, those are the things we're hyper focused on. But when you look at our openings for the last couple of years and the next couple of years, we're going into some pretty expensive big metro markets. We've opened Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston and Denver in the last couple of years. And in the next couple, we have San Francisco and Seattle coming. So often times, in a place like that, the land acquisition price is going to overwhelm the store build in some cases. So we're really focused on building as efficient we can. But the answer is I think we are building a more efficient box than we used to, but it's hard to really discern when you look at the total CapEx."

Good morning, everyone thanks for joining the call today. As usual, I'll start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter, Tom Reedy will then give some more detail around financing and we'll turn over to Bill Nash will share some additional information regarding the quarter.
First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us, total revenues increased by 2.8%, used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominately and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales, given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion.
For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%, wholesale units grew by 1.8%, CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million, net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million, and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90.
During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.

Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end.
Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw a growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. Cash net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year's first quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to the lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space.
Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, due to a commission of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit timing by your third-party lenders.
As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin, partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year's first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year's favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unbearable loss experience as this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in recovery rate.
Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managers receivables compared to 0.94% in last year's first quarter at 0.99% last quarter. This los reservist within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year's first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average minimum receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that's consistent with the last couple of quarters.
Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million -- turning over to CarMax overall now. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY '16. This was partially due to higher average debt levels that more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing.
During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we'll fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter.
We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization.
I'll turn it over to Bill."

Midsized and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year's first quarter, remained flat compared to the fourth quarter.
SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth was primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year, and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit, was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223.
During our last call, I highlight some of the advancements we're making to improve the customer experience in driving efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we will be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April, it combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer's individual preferences.
We will also continue to test different components of selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we're currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being prequalified for financing, before-the-store visit helps build the customer confidence and will make that in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores.
We continue to believe that no one's in a better position at CarMax to deliver more of the transaction online or even delivered the car to the homes. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for, is what will set us apart from our competitors.
During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets, 1 and Springfield, Illinois and 1 in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open 2 more stores, 1 in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us, and the other will be our third store in the Boston market.

So I don't think we would have expected to have a repeat of that. That's kind of the first point. We also seem pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember, back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high-end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years though, we have expanding at the lower end of what has done some testing and some, I guess, prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss, back in line with where we've try to run it, at that 2% to 2.5%, which a very highly financeable portfolio.

And some of that has -- that would -- if you would have maybe expectations of that will increase told us in the portfolio. But we did have some unfavorable experience in the quarter, as I mentioned, due to -- partially due to the expansion, partially due to the wholesale recovery rate."

I've always said our goal is to have sustainable partners that are there for our customers and could have a wide range of financing. In the quarter though, we did see 1 line in particular pullback and was sent there. You've seen them out in the public domain talking about how they are pulling back inside and prime auto, letting other business to other folks. So it's not inconsistent with what they've been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happened during the quarter. And it feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, is their business, they're going to manage their portfolio if they see fit. And if they determine the need to dial back or get more aggressive, they're going to do that. I think Matt ... [indiscernible] a long time, that subprime as a percentage of our total sales has, at 1 point, it was pretty much 0. It's been as high as 19 in a year and then, I think last year, we ended at 16 or 16 for the year. So whatever it ends up is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we've always talked about what this phase is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these point-of-sale are also significant the less profitable. That's one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, then the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is a quintal because of the way we flow financing from lender to lender. But at the same time, it's going to move around based on a whole bunch of different factors."

And as far as the ratio, I think I would say that I can't  -- we don't want to be super excited about it because it's not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, 2/3 and 1/3 to the traffic. And I think there's, I mentioned, traffic earlier as it relates to this space. I not giving too many specifics, what I would said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customer. So it just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell 1 car than it does to sell 1 car of a non-Tier 3 customers.

We -- a quarter or so ago, we got up to the bottom end of that range. So it would be natural to see a little bit of a tapering off as we've move from a mode of moving to the -- a newer capital structure, a more leverage capital structure to one of maintaining that capital structure. That said, with the amount of cash that we have generated and becoming all things being equal, the amount of cash we generate, the amount of growth we're doing, we would expect to continue to need to repurchase shares and add debt into the capital structure to maintain that. So I would say, our expectation is to be in the market on a pretty consistent basis going forward, but we do have some parameters around our program that allows us to be more or less aggressive to any market conditions."

Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining the call today. As usual, I'll start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter, Tom Reedy will then give some more detail on our financing and we'll turn over to Bill Nash, who will share some additional information regarding the quarter.
First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us, total revenues increased by 2.8%, used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominately and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales, given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion.
For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%, wholesale units grew by 1.8%, CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million, and net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million, and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90.
During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.

This quarter, consistent with last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across th",555,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end.
Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw a growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year's first quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space.
Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a combination of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit typing by your third-party lenders.
As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin, partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year's first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year's favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unfavorable loss experience this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in wholesale recovery rate.
Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managed receivables compared to 0.94% in last year's first quarter and 0.99% last quarter. This loss reserve is within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charge to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year's first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that's consistent with the last couple of quarters.
Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million -- turning over to CarMax overall now. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY '16. This was partially due to higher average debt levels, but more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing.
During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we'll fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter.
We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization.
I'll turn it over to Bill."

Midsized and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year's first quarter, but remained flat compared to the fourth quarter.
SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year, and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223.
During our last call, I highlighted some of the advancements we're making to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we would be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April, it combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer's individual preferences.
We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we're currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being prequalified for financing, before-the-store visit helps build the customers' confidence and will make the in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores.
We continue to believe that no one's in a better position than CarMax to deliver more of the transaction online or even deliver the car to the homes. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for, is what will set us apart from our competitors.
During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets,  one in Springfield, Illinois and one in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open 2 more stores, one in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us, and the other will be our third store in the Boston market.

So I don't think we would have expected to have a repeat of that. That's kind of the first point. We have also seen a pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember, back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years though, we have been expanding at the lower end of what CAF has done with some testing and some, I guess, of a prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss, back in line with where we've try to run it, at 2% to 2.5%, which is a very highly financeable portfolio itself. I think it's fair to say that activity in the last couple of years, we have gotten a bit more aggressive intentionally. And we get compensated for that with higher rates. And some of that has -- that would -- if you would have, maybe expectation of that would increase losses in the portfolio.

As I've always said our goal is to have sustainable partners that are there for our customers and can provide a wide range of financing. In the quarter though, we did -- we see one line of particular pullback, it was Santander. I mean, you've seen them out in the public domain talking about how they are pulling back in sub-prime auto, letting other business go to other folks. So it's not inconsistent with what they've been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happen during the quarter. And feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, it's their business, they're going to manage their portfolio if they see fit. And if they determine the need to dial back or get more aggressive, that they're going to do that.  I think Matt, we've followed it a long time. You know that sub-prime as a percentage of our total sales has, at one point, it was pretty much 0. It's been as high as 19% in a year and then, I think last year, we ended at 16% or 16% for the year. So where ever it ends up, is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we've always talked about with this phase is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these points of sale are also significantly less profitable. That's one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, that the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is incremental because of the way we flow financing from lender to lender.

So it's not really a change in the number of approvals, but the quality of approvals and therefore, the ability the customer to accept or the willingness for the customer to accept it. And as far as the ratio, I think I would say that I can't  -- we don't want to be super excited about it because it's not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, 2/3 and 1/3 to the traffic. And I think there's, I mentioned, traffic earlier as it relates to the space  And without giving too many specifics, what I said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customer. So if you just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell 1 car than it does to sell 1 car of a non-Tier 3 customers. So if we're down by 2.5 points in Tier 3 percent of sales, it represents a disproportionately higher percentage of traffic than the sale that it generates."

Or is there anything else from the number that would move it higher?"

That said, with the amount of cash that we have generating it and becoming all things being equal, the amount of cash we generate, the amount of growth we're doing, we would expect to continue to need to repurchase shares and add debt into the capital structure to maintain that.

As usual, I'll start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter. Tom Reedy will then give some more detail around financing and we'll turn it over to Bill Nash, who will share some additional information regarding the quarter.
First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us, total revenues increased by 2.8%, used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominately and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales, given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion.
For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%, wholesale units grew by 1.8%, CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million, and net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million, and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90.
During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.

Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with the last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end.
Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw a growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year's first quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space.
Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a combination of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit typing by our third-party lenders.
As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin, partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year's first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year's favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unfavorable loss experience this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in wholesale recovery rate.
Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managed receivables compared to 0.94% in last year's first quarter and 0.99% last quarter. This loss reserve is within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year's first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that's consistent with the last couple of quarters.
Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million -- turning over to CarMax overall amount. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY '16. This was partially due to higher average debt levels, but more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing.
During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we'll fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter.
We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization.
I'll turn it over to Bill."

As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles remained essentially flat compared to last year at approximately 77%. Midsized and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year's first quarter, but remained flat compared to the fourth quarter.
SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year, and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223.
During our last call, I highlighted some of the advancements we are making to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we would be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April, it combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer's individual preferences.
We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we're currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being prequalified for financing before-the-store visit helps build the customers' confidence and will make the in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores.
We continue to believe that no one's in a better position than CarMax to deliver more of the transaction online or even deliver the car to the home. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine a state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for, is what will set us apart from our competitors.
During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets, one in Springfield, Illinois and one in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open 2 more stores, one in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us, and the other will be our third store in the Boston market.
Now we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

So I don't think we would have expected to have a repeat of that. So that's kind of the first point. We've also seen a pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember, back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years, though, we've been expanding at the lower end of what CAF has done with some testing and some, I guess, of a prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss back in line with where we've try to run it, at that 2% to 2.5%, which is a very highly financeable portfolio. So I think it's fair to say that activity in the last couple of years, we have gotten a bit more aggressive intentionally. And we get compensated for that with higher rates. And some of that has -- that would -- you would have -- any expectation of that would increase losses in the portfolio. But we did have some unfavorable experience in the quarter, as I mentioned, due to -- partially due to that expansion and partially due to the wholesale recovery rate."

As I've always said, our goal is to have sustainable partners that are there for our customers and can provide a wide range of financing. In the quarter, though, we did -- we see one lender particular, pull back, it was Santander. I mean, you've seen them out in the public domain talking about how they are pulling back in sub-prime auto, letting other business go to other folks. So it's not inconsistent with what they've been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happen during the quarter. And feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, it's their business, they're going to manage their portfolio as they see fit. And if they determine the need to dial back or get more aggressive, that they're going to do that. I think, Matt, you've followed us a long time. You know that sub-prime as a percentage of our total sales has, at one point, it was pretty much 0. It's been as high as 19% in a year and then, I think last year, we ended at 16% or 16% for the year. So where ever it ends up, is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we've always talked about with this space is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these points of sale are also significantly less profitable. That's one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, that the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is incremental because of the way we flow financing from lender to lender.

Occasionally, there's some pockets where we don't think it's a great deal for our customer, so we might be a little light in a particular area. But what you see as a overall percent of sales for the company is largely driven by consumer demand and our inventory turns. At a pace of 600,000-ish cars a year, about half of which we have to buy offsite and half of which we buy through the appraisal lane, approximately, we're going to buy what customers are buying from us and replenish at that same pace.

We -- if you look at the percent of customers that are getting up in approval of some kind in the stores that's well above 90%, what we're seeing is a decline -- a degradation in, I guess, I would say, the quality of the offers, meaning they might be asking for a little bit more money down or they're asking for stipulations, in particular, we've seen a step up in that with one of the lenders is an increase in asking for proof of income, asking for proof of residence, asking for proof of phone number and things like that. So it's not really a change in the number of approvals, but the quality of approvals and therefore, the ability of the customer to accept or the willingness of the customer to accept it. And as far as the ratio, I would say that I can't -- I don't want to be too precise about this because it's not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, 2/3 and 1/3 to the traffic. And I think -- I mentioned traffic earlier as it relates to the space And without giving too many specifics, what I said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customer. So if you just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell 1 car than it does to sell 1 car of a non-Tier 3 customer. So if we're down by 2.5 points in Tier 3 percent of sales, it represents a disproportionately higher percentage of traffic than the sale that it generates."

If they're good deals, we'll be able to realize those good deals for our customers. So we kind of think of them separately, appraisal lane versus off-site."

As usual, I'll start with a quick overview of the key drivers of the quarter. Tom Reedy will then give some more detail around financing and we'll turn it over to Bill Nash, who will share some additional information regarding the quarter.
First quarter fiscal 2017 was a challenging one for us, total revenues increased by 2.8%, used unit comps were slightly positive and total used units grew 4%. Comp units were driven by an improvement in conversion, which offset a modest decrease in traffic. We do believe that the decline in traffic is both predominately and disproportionately a result of the decrease in Tier 3 sales, given the fact that Tier 3 conversion has historically been significantly lower than our non-Tier 3 conversion.
For the non-Tier 3 customer base, comp units actually rose by 3.6%. Total web traffic increased by 7%, wholesale units grew by 1.8%, CAF quarterly income fell 7.7% to $101 million, and net income for the first quarter declined by 3.6% to $175 million, and EPS rose 4.7% to $0.90.
During the first quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to talk about finance. Tom?"

This quarter, consistent with the last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications acros",556,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. This quarter, consistent with the last 2 quarters, we continue to experience a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline in applications across the lower end.
Consequently, we saw growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF. We also saw a growth in the share of sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing. CAF net penetration was up over 1 percentage point to 43.9% compared with 42.7% in last year's first quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and the higher penetration of CAF. Tier 2 financing, as a percent of sales, fell slightly year-over-year to 17.4% compared to 18%, due to lower applicant flow, which was partially offset by stronger conversion in that space.
Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales declined to 11.9% compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a combination of lower applicant volume and some measurable credit typing by our third-party lenders.
As Tom mentioned, CAF income of $101 million represented a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses, a lower interest margin, partially offset by 12% growth in average managed receivables to $9.7 billion. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first quarter reflected the favorability we commented on in last year's first quarter, selling favorable experience in the current quarter as well as the growth in the receivables. Given last year's favorability, much of the year-over-year increase in the provision was expected. However, we did have some unfavorable loss experience this quarter reflecting several factors, including a drop in wholesale recovery rate.
Our ending allowance for loan losses at $104 million was 1.05% of ending managed receivables compared to 0.94% in last year's first quarter and 0.99% last quarter. This loss reserve is within our range of expectations given our origination strategy, which includes our Tier 3 activity.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.5%, similar to the 7.4% in last year's first quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.3% in the first quarter of last year, but that's consistent with the last couple of quarters.
Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million -- turning over to CarMax overall amount. Interest expense in the quarter rose to $11 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of FY '16. This was partially due to higher average debt levels, but more than half of the increase was a result of the completion of lease extensions related to some of our stores as we discussed in our last 10-K filing.
During the first quarter, we executed a private debt placement of $500 million. We sold $300 million of the deal in the first quarter, which was primarily used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance. And we'll fund the remaining $200 million sometime in the second quarter.
We also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $132 million. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under the current authorization.
I'll turn it over to Bill."

Midsized and large SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales increased by over 2% to approximately 25% in this first quarter compared to last year's first quarter, but remained flat compared to the fourth quarter.
SG&A expense for the first quarter increased 8.7% to $380 million. This growth primarily reflects the 11% or 16 store increase in our store base since the beginning of the first quarter of last year, and a $7 million increase or $36 per unit in share-based compensation expense.
Another $3 million increase in cost or roughly $18 a unit was related to hail damage incurred in several of our Texas markets during the quarter. In total, our SG&A per unit increased by $97 to $2,223.
During our last call, I highlighted some of the advancements we are making to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Specifically, I mentioned that we would be rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website. The new website was fully rolled out in April, it combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We have also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform. This will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience based on the customer's individual preferences.
We will also continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customer needs. One of the new capabilities that we're currently testing is offering our customers online financing. Being prequalified for financing before-the-store visit helps build the customers' confidence and will make the in-store shopping experience faster and more enjoyable. Our plan is to initially roll it out to 10 stores.
We continue to believe that no one's in a better position than CarMax to deliver more of the transaction online or even deliver the car to the home. No one can match our existing infrastructure, our national footprint, our inventory scale and our brand strength. The ability to combine a state-of-the-art online experience, with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for, is what will set us apart from our competitors.
During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores, both in new markets, one in Springfield, Illinois and one in San Francisco. We plan to open 13 other stores during the fiscal year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened a store in El Paso, another new market for us. During the second quarter, we expect to open 2 more stores, one in Bristol, Tennessee, which is another new market for us, and the other will be our third store in the Boston market.

But at this point, everything we know about the environment, including the experience we had in this quarter and having losses come in a little hot, is baked into that forward-looking estimate. When you see the increase in that provision for loan losses, it's a combination of both our experience in the quarter versus our expectation of what we had booked, and an adjustment to the overall portfolio based on what we've learned.

So I don't think we would have expected to have a repeat of that. So that's kind of the first point. We've also seen a pretty significant growth in the portfolio, which means losses are going to step-up. And then also in the last 2 years, we have expanded on the credit front a bit. If you remember, back in 2013, we got much more aggressive with customers at the very high end of credit, offering very low rates to the highest credit quality customers. That had an impact of kind of bringing down our expected losses on the portfolio. Over the last 2 years, though, we've been expanding at the lower end of what CAF has done with some testing and some, I guess, of a prudent expansion, in an effort to bring our targeted cumulative net loss back in line with where we've try to run it, at that 2% to 2.5%, which is a very highly financeable portfolio. So I think it's fair to say that activity in the last couple of years, we have gotten a bit more aggressive intentionally. And we get compensated for that with higher rates. And some of that has -- that would -- you would have -- any expectation of that would increase losses in the portfolio.

In the quarter, though, we did -- we see one lender particular, pull back, it was Santander. I mean, you've seen them out in the public domain talking about how they are pulling back in sub-prime auto, letting other business go to other folks. So it's not inconsistent with what they've been saying in the public domain. So as far as what they will do going forward, I could say we saw a couple of different things happen during the quarter. And feel like it stabilized during the quarter. But looking forward, it's their business, they're going to manage their portfolio as they see fit. And if they determine the need to dial back or get more aggressive, that they're going to do that. I think, Matt, you've followed us a long time. You know that sub-prime as a percentage of our total sales has, at one point, it was pretty much 0. It's been as high as 19% in a year and then, I think last year, we ended at 16% or 16% for the year. So where ever it ends up, is going to be a result of a whole bunch of different factors, lender behavior, applicant flow, but what we've always talked about with this space is, we believe each customer is almost 100% incremental. Remember also that these points of sale are also significantly less profitable. That's one of the reasons we wanted to point out that if you take out the decline of 2 points or 2.5 points, whatever it was in the quarter, that the rest of our business actually grew by 3.6%. And if you look at our mix of business as a base from which to grow, this is actually a better base from which to grow than if we go back when 19% of our sales were Tier 3. Again, we believe that 100% of it or almost 100% of it is incremental because of the way we flow financing from lender to lender. But at the same time, it's going to move around based on a whole bunch of different factors."

On the other hand, it does seem like perhaps some of this competing away, I don't know if it's the middle part of the market or other consumers who might otherwise shop through Tier 2. So any kind of holistic comments on whether the competition is increasing in any part of the credit spectrum?"

We -- if you look at the percent of customers that are getting up in approval of some kind in the stores that's well above 90%, what we're seeing is a decline -- a degradation in, I guess, I would say, the quality of the offers, meaning they might be asking for a little bit more money down or they're asking for stipulations, in particular, we've seen a step up in that with one of the lenders is an increase in asking for proof of income, asking for proof of residence, asking for proof of phone number and things like that. So it's not really a change in the number of approvals, but the quality of approvals and therefore, the ability of the customer to accept or the willingness of the customer to accept it. And as far as the ratio, I would say that I can't -- I don't want to be too precise about this because it's not easy to calculate. But I think the preponderance of the change is due to the change in behavior, call it, 2/3 and 1/3 to the traffic. And I think -- I mentioned traffic earlier as it relates to the space And without giving too many specifics, what I said was, we convert these customers at a significantly lower rate than we do non-Tier 3 customer. So if you just think about it that way, it takes more flow of customers to sell 1 car than it does to sell 1 car of a non-Tier 3 customer.

A superstore obviously helps with the conversion rate, but traffic has been an issue for a few quarters now. And at the same time, latest report suggests industry retail sales are growing at a healthy clip. So is that because of these aggregate websites taking traffic elsewhere? And if so, would you consider having a bigger presence on aggregated websites?"

One additional comment on traffic, Bill mentioned some of this earlier, is it's been widely reported that customers are visiting less stores before they buy. So it only makes sense that customers who show up, would be more likely to buy. And as I've said, we think comps will be driven by traffic and conversion. It's not going to always line up and it doesn't matter to us, which way we get it. So lot of the efforts we're making around developing a new website, giving the customer more digital capability are -- those efforts are to make sure that customers get more information, do more research, are more prepared.

That said, the structure and the enhancement of the deal might need to be modified if loss -- if the perceived losses in the rating agency size change. What that usually means though is a change in the over collateralization that gets built into the deals and builds over time, I mean, we get money back a little bit slower. But in general, we've been able to maintain a pretty solid program through a lot of different environments. As far as our partner lenders, I just have to ask them about how they view that and their tightening, but again, they -- I think probably more of the impact is what they're experiencing in their portfolio than the overall wholesale market."

First, I want to take a moment just to thank Tom Folliard for his significant contributions to CarMax over the last 23 years. We're very fortunate that he is still involved and will be our Chairman of our Board. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with him. So Tom, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are, since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time in the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax.
Over these past few months, I spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job, delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great, and I'm committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I'm also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future. 
More than 20 years ago, CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience, and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we're focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We are in a unique position to leverage our core strength, which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience.
We've launched a new website. We're testing new online shopping capabilities, and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car-buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide.
Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We're committed to our national expansion, and we'll open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year. 
Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I'll conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives. 
Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3%, and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by strong improvement conversion, but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%. 
When it comes our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at 21 60 remain consistent with 21 66 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year we had 1 less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays. Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year is also vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year. 
Gross profit for wholesale units decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison. 
Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand from older and less expensive vehicles. 
On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million, which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during a quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a $5 increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter.
The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree, even though he's somewhat younger, but he's far exceeded the service requirement having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091843,1049237,"CarMax Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in th",527,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales from customers paid cash or brought their own financing.
CAF net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our Tier 2 lenders performance based on what we see on the are conversion of customers to sales continued to be strong, they were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower-end credit applications as well. 
In addition to this lower volume, Tier 3 sales continued to be effective at credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% in the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced starting in the middle of Q1 this year.
CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion. 
The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables and the additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending management receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we've learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy in our portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin, however, has been at about 5.9% for 3 consecutive quarters. 
Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels, which as we've discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy as well as the store lease extensions that we've previously discussed in our filings.
During the second quarter, we took down the remaining $200 million of the private debt deal we closed in Q1, and we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $126 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

During the second quarter, we opened 3 stores: El Paso, Texas and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were new market for us. We also open a third store in Boston.

During the third quarter, we expect to open 5 more stores, 4 will be in current markets, including Philadelphia, Orlando and 2 in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us. 
Last quarter, I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I'd like to give you an update on those efforts.
I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive website. The new website combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform, which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience. This is the first full quarter with the new website in place, and we are pleased with the performance so far. We've seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts. With our new site, we have to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to store and finally to a sale.
Second, we've been testing an online financing capability to help our customers get prequalified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. Taking the prequalified for financing from any computer or mobile device, and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We've expanded the pilot to 13 stores, and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months, and we will provide you with an update next quarter. 
Lastly, we've previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test, we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store. We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car-buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like. CarMax is national footprint, unparalleled inventory and branch strength position us to continue to lead the industry.

But I think it's important to point out that we've been in an environment of very favorable, not just we, but the overall credit markets in general, have been in a very favorable loss environment for the last few years and last couple of years, at least. And it's not usually surprising to see things start to migrate a little bit differently. That said, all we can put into our provision is what we learned to date. We're not making any prognostications about the future and continued movement. And obviously, we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies, if it merits that. I mean, as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, it's not that big of an uptick. If you look year-over-year, it's a pretty significant jump, about -- but about half of that jump, we would have expected based on the fact that the portfolio has grown 12% and the experience that we had from -- in Q1, we incorporated into our provision for this quarter. So there was some unexpected unfavorable experience, but much of the change in the provision shouldn't be too unexpected even though it was a previous step-up."

If you can a look at our degradation year-over-year, we'd estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume, and the remaining 60% is really due to a change in behavior with our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who's been in the press about talking about how they're pulling back in different spaces. We saw change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn't really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1. But since May, we've seen stable performance in the Tier 3 space. That doesn't -- I'm not speaking to the future, but we've seen 4 months of stability, and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes. As far as the changes, it's more of the thing that we talked about in the past as we've seen changes in lender behavior our global approval rate is still well above 90%. But the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they're asking for more down or if they're asking for stipulations like proof of income, et cetera. And so that's the nature of the tightening that we've seen."

There's a course or a change our action in the segment that will be appropriate. Remember, we've always talked about this business I think incremental, and we already invested $1,000 per car into this channel in order to realize half, 1/3 to 1/2 of the profit of the Tier 2 or a CAF deal. So we can speculate that what our lenders like to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive. I'm sure they would say they'd try. But I don't think we're interested in increasing or decreasing our margin any further on this space. And we're certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our Tier 3 partners. That's just not a good business for us. I think the investments will discuss in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us. And looking at the business, absent the effect of the Tier 3 space, we're not -- we're pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer term, growing off of the base of 45% CAF and 10% Tier 3 is a much more profitable equation, than what we're seeing in Tier 3 near 20% a couple of years ago. So I don't now, what's it's make of the overall environment. But like I said, I don't think there's any action, of course, we will change to try to address phenomenon we're seeing."

It's really too early to give any results because we just started the second test just in the last couple of weeks. And again, the plan for this test is to understand how we've been able to operationalize it better. Can we operationalize it even more? And then really important that also is that we want to make sure that the experience meets our high standards of great customer service that we have in the store. So that's really what we're trying to understand with this piece. It's too early to really talk about any type of results. On the search engine optimization, obviously, the big part of the web redesign is making sure that when customers and search for us, that we come up organically. For those that's the best thing. When you don't have to pay for leading, you just automatically come up on the first page. And what I can tell you if I look at over a year ago -- about a year ago, if you search for us from generic terms, we didn't show up on the first page. We were, in some cases, several pages below the first page. And if you search something, you typically don't go many pages pass the first page. I'm pleased to tell you that we make great strides. And when you type in keywords now, we're on that first page, and our goal is to continue to climb that first page.

We're very fortunate that he's still involved and will be our Chairman of our board. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with him. So Tom, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are, since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time of the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax.
Over these past few months, I've spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job, delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great associates, and I'm committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I'm also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future.
More than 20 years ago, CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience, and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we're focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We're in a unique position to leverage our core strength, which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience.
We've launched a new website, we're testing new online shopping capabilities and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide.
Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We're committed to our national expansion, and we'll open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year.
Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I'll conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3%, and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion, but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of  the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%.
When it comes to our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at $2,160 remain consistent with $2,166 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year we had 1 less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays.
Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year's wholesale vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year. Gross profit for wholesale units decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison.
Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles.
On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million, which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax' stock price during a quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a $5 increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter.
The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree, even though he's somewhat younger, but he's far exceeded the service requirement, having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091843,1049321,"CarMax Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in th",532,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales from customers who paid cash or bought their -- brought their own financing.
CAF net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax' sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our Tier 2 lenders' performance, based on what we see on their conversion of customers to sales, continued to be strong. They were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower-end credit applications as well.
In addition to this lower volume, Tier 3 sales continue to be affected by credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% in the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced, starting in the middle of Q1 of this year.
CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion.
The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables and the additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending management receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we've learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin, however, has been at about 5.9% for 3 consecutive quarters.
Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels, which, as we've discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy as well as the store lease extensions that we've previously discussed in our filings. During the second quarter, we took down the remaining $200 million of the private debt deal we closed in Q1, and we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $126 million.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idah",486,"Thanks, Tom. During the second quarter, we opened 3 stores: El Paso, Texas and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were new markets for us. We also opened a third store in Boston. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idaho, another new market for us. During the third quarter, we expect to open 5 more stores, 4 will be in current markets, including Philadelphia, Orlando and 2 in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us.
Last quarter, I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I'd like to give you an update on those efforts.
I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive website. The new website combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform, which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience.
This is the first full quarter with the new website in place, and we are pleased with the performance so far. We've seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts. With our new site, we hope to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale.
Second, we've been testing an online financing capability to help our customers get prequalified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. They can get prequalified for financing from any computer or mobile device and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We've expanded the pilot to 13 stores, and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months, and we will provide you with an update next quarter.
Lastly, we've previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test, we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store.
We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like. CarMax' national footprint, unparalleled inventory and branch strength position us to continue to lead the industry.
Now I'll open it up for questions. Victoria?"

And it's not usually surprising to see things start to migrate a little bit differently. That said, all we can put into our provision is what we've learned to date. We're not making any prognostications about our future and continued movement. And obviously, we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies, if it merits that. I mean, as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, it's not that big of an uptick. If you look year-over-year, it's a pretty significant jump, about -- but about half of that jump, we would have expected based on the fact that the portfolio has grown 12% and the experience that we had from -- in Q1, we incorporated into our provision for this quarter. So there was some unexpected, unfavorable experience, but much of the change in the provision shouldn't be too unexpected, even though it was a pretty big step-up."

If you kind of look at our degradation year-over-year, we'd estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume, and the remaining 60% is really due to change in behavior with our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who's been in the press about -- and talking about how they're pulling back in different spaces. We saw change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn't really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1. But since May, we've seen stable performance in the Tier 3 space. That doesn't -- I'm not speaking to the future, but we've seen 4 months of stability, and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes. As far as the changes, it's more of the same that we talked about in the past. As we've seen changes in lender behavior, our global approval rate is still well above 90%. But the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they're asking for more down or if they're asking for stipulations like proof of income, et cetera. And so that's the nature of the tightening that we've seen."

The interesting thing about this space is there's very few national players. It's much more a regional space in the financing world, so we can test additional lenders. As far as CarMax Auto Finance, we're comfortable with the -- our level of activity, where it is. I mean, they're -- we're not -- Santander is not pulling out because they're delighted with what they're seeing in that portfolio. And when we think about that space, there's more to it than just the profit. There's the impact on our brand. There's the impact on our reputation with customers. And in this current environment, I think we're happier being thought of as a prime lender that has some activity in the Tier 3 space. We're learning from it. We're learning how to originate. We're learning how to service. We're learning how to perform, and we're building a track record in that space. But we haven't determined that it -- now is the time to go forward with anything greater. And if you remember, when we first rolled this out a couple of years ago, we've said specifically that we were not interested in this space in order to augment sales at CarMax.

So to the extent that might play into things, it's there. But -- and  we ask about that and what you might do about it. As we think about the hypothesis for what could be driving this, it's not parent [ph] tested. There is a course of -- or a change in our action in this segment that would be appropriate. Remember, we've always talked about this business as incremental, and we already invested $1,000 per car into this channel in order to realize 1/2 -- 1/3 to 1/2 of the profit of a Tier 2 or a CAF deal. So we can speculate that -- what our lenders like, to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive. I'm sure they would say they'd try. But I don't think we're interested in increasing the -- or decreasing our margin any further on this space. And we're certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our Tier 3 partners. That's just not a good business for us. I think the investments Bill discussed in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us. And looking at the business, absent the effect of the Tier 3 space, we're not -- we're pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer term, growing off of the base of 45% CAF and 10% Tier 3 is a much more profitable equation than when we were seeing Tier 3 near 20% a couple of years ago. So I don't know what does it make of the overall environment, but like I said, I don't think there's any action. Of course, we will change to try to address the phenomenon we're seeing."

I mean, when we back out the increase in stock comp, there really wasn't much deleveraging, and we're looking at a store base that's almost 11% greater year-over-year. We're looking at investment in online opportunities and all your new efforts. Yes, we're not seeing a deleveraging in SG&A. So just curious, as we think about sort of all the buckets of potential increases in deleveraging that we usually would expect, how are they playing out in SG&A? And how do you think that should work going forward because it really is a very impressive performance? There really was no SG&A deleverage. And traditionally, we would look for, I got 7% to 8% increase in same-store sales to see this kind of performance. And you only -- you put up a good number, 3.1%, but I mean, it's not what we would have expected. It was a very good performance. Is there anything going on here in thrifting in certain areas or some investment that not might be as great as we were thinking?"

So I wouldn't read into this that we're doing a better job with SG&A than we had in the past. We're investing comp and benefits, if you kind of look at those 2 things, absent those 2 things, it's in line with that 11% you see on the table and the graph.

And the performance of the finance business is going to be somewhat market driven. We have to be an attractive alternative for our customers in financing or else, we'll be turning people off to CarMax. So if competition is aggressive and willing to accept a slightly lower spread than they are currently, we will have to adjust our offers over time to meet that competition and maintain -- make sure that we're still relevant to the customer. That said, if you look at the last 8 or 9 securitization deals, the spread has been pretty consistent in the mid-5s, and that's not out of line with what we've seen in a higher interest rate environment. So like I said, we've been in higher interest rate environments before where cost of funds have been higher. We've been able to achieve the spreads we are today.

So that's really what we're trying to understand with this piece. It's too early to really talk about any type of results. On the search engine optimization, obviously, the big part of the web redesign is making sure that when customers search for us, that we come up organically. Now those are the -- that's the best thing, when you don't have to pay for a leading, you just automatically come up on the first page. And what I can tell you, if I look at over a year ago -- about a year ago, if you search for us in some generic terms, we didn't show up on the first page. We were, in some cases, several pages below the first page. And if you search something, you typically don't go many pages past the first page. I'm pleased to tell you that we made great strides.

So if you look at the wholesale margin GPU, I call it out earlier in my remarks, it's a very tough comparison. When I say tough comparison, last year's second quarter was the highest GPU for wholesale we've ever experienced as an organization, so -- I'm sorry, in the second quarter. So it was a very tough comparison. I think what you're seeing is the amount that we're at now is more representative of a typical second quarter. The other thing that I would point out is last year's second quarter, from a depreciation or appreciation standpoint, it was really stable. This year, it was a depreciating market. And you know, we aren't proactive. We're more reactive, and we move as the market moves. We don't speculate. So I think it's a combined factor of tough comparison and also a different type of market this second quarter, which really is more representative of what we would typically see in the second quarter versus last year."

We'll continue to test, but I also feel good about the fact that we're able to maintain that GPU. And as I think about levers to pull, if we want to make sure our price stays competitive, it's not just GPU, it's also acquisition price and it's also about the dollars that you put into a vehicle to get it to our quality standards. So again, I think our focus is going to be on acquisition price. It'll be on the reconditioning because again, we want to put more focus on the spread between what -- we buy [ph] a car and what a customer ultimately pays for it.

First, I want to take a moment just to thank Tom Folliard for his significant contributions to CarMax over the last 23 years. We're very fortunate that he's still involved and will be our Chairman of our board. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with him. So Tom, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are, since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time of the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax.
Over these past few months, I've spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job, delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great associates, and I'm committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I'm also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future.
More than 20 years ago, CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience, and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we're focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We're in a unique position to leverage our core strength, which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for, and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience.
We've launched a new website, we're testing new online shopping capabilities and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide.
Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We're committed to our national expansion, and we'll open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year.
Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I'll conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3%, and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion, but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%.
When it comes to our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at $2,160 remained consistent with $2,166 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, we had 1 less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays.
Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year's wholesale vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year. Gross profit for wholesale units decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison.
Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles.
On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million, which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during the quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a $5 increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter.
The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree, even though he's somewhat younger, but he's far exceeded the service requirement, having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091843,1049391,"CarMax Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in th",532,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales from customers who paid cash or bought their -- brought their own financing.
CAF's net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our Tier 2 lenders' performance, based on what we see on their conversion of customers to sales, continued to be strong, they were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower-end credit applications as well.
In addition to this lower volume, Tier 3 sales continue to be affected by credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% in the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced, starting in the middle of Q1 of this year.
CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion.
The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables and the additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we've learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin, however, has been at about 5.9% for 3 consecutive quarters.
Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels, which, as we've discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy, as well as the store lease extensions that we've previously discussed in our filings. During the second quarter, we took down the remaining $200 million of the private debt deal we closed in Q1, and we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $126 million.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

During the second quarter, we opened 3 stores: El Paso, Texas and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were new markets for us. We also opened a third store in Boston. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idaho, another new market for us. During the third quarter, we expect to open 5 more stores. Four will be in current markets, including Philadelphia, Orlando and 2 in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us.
Last quarter, I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I'd like to give you an update on those efforts.
I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive website. The new website combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform, which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience.
This is the first full quarter with the new website in place, and we are pleased with the performance so far. We've seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts. With our new site, we hope to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale.
Second, we've been testing an online financing capability to help our customers get prequalified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. They can get prequalified for financing from any computer or mobile device and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We've expanded the pilot to 13 stores, and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months, and we will provide you with an update next quarter.
Lastly, we've previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test, we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store.
We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like. CarMax's national footprint, unparalleled inventory and brand strength position us to continue to lead the industry.

But I think it's important to point out that we've been in an environment of very favorable -- not just we, but the overall credit markets in general have been in a very favorable loss environment for the last few years or last couple of years, at least. And it's not usually surprising to see things start to migrate a little bit differently. That said, all we can put into our provision is what we've learned to date. We're not making any prognostications about the future and continued movement. And obviously, we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies, if it merits that. I mean, as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, or sequentially, it's not that big of an uptick.

If you kind of look at our degradation year-over-year, we'd estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume, and the remaining 60% is really due to change in behavior with our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who's been in the press about -- and talking about how they're pulling back in different spaces, we saw a change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn't really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1. But since May, we've seen stable performance in the Tier 3 space. That doesn't -- I'm not speaking to the future, but we've seen 4 months of stability, and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes. As far as the changes, it's more of the same that we talked about in the past as we've seen changes in lender behavior. Our global approval rate is still well above 90%. But the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they're asking for more down or if they're asking for stipulations like proof of income, et cetera.

I mean, they're -- we're not -- Santander is not pulling back because they're delighted with what they're seeing in that portfolio. And when we think about that space, there's more to it than just the profit. There's the impact on our brand. There's the impact on our reputation with customers.

Remember, we've always talked about this business as incremental, and we already invested $1,000 per car into this channel in order to realize 1/2 -- 1/3 to 1/2 of the profit of a Tier 2 or a CAF deal. So we can speculate that -- would our lenders like to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive? I'm sure they would say they'd try. But I don't think we're interested in increasing the -- or decreasing our margin any further on this space. And we're certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our Tier 3 partners. That's just not good business for us. I think the investments Bill discussed in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us. And looking at the business, absent the effect of the Tier 3 space, we're not -- we're pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer term, growing off of the base of 45% CAF and 10% Tier 3 is a much more profitable equation than when we were seeing Tier 3 near 20% a couple of years ago. So I don't know what this makes of the overall environment, but like I said, I don't think there's any action or course we would change to try to address the phenomenon we're seeing."

So I think you have to step back and take more of a holistic picture and not just look at traffic because I do think part of the reason conversion is up, I think it's from execution, but I also think it's partly because people are coming in more informed and knowing what they want."

That said, if you look at the last 8 or 9 securitization deals, the spread has been pretty consistent in the mid-5s, and that's not out of line with what we've seen in a higher interest rate environment. So like I said, we've been in higher interest rate environments before where cost of funds have been higher, where we've been able to achieve the spreads we are today.

So I think the message there is it's become a part of what we do. As far as on a go-forward basis, we talked about having a target capital structure in the kind of the adjusted debt to capital range of 35% to 45%. Both last quarter and this quarter, we're kind of scratching up on the bottom end of that. And as I said last quarter, I think you can look to be more in a maintenance mode rather than a ""shifting the capital structure"" mode on a go-forward basis. That said, with the cash flow nature of the business, as it stands today, we'll continue to generate significant cash, and we would expect to continue to buy back stock and continue to add debt to maintain that booked [ph] target. And as we've said before, we tried to do a little bit of an enlightened averaging in. So I wouldn't read into volume in any given quarter.

The other thing that I would point out is last year's second quarter, from a depreciation or appreciation standpoint, it was really stable. This year, it was a depreciating market. And you know, we aren't proactive. We're more reactive, and we move as the market moves. We don't speculate.

First, I want to take a moment just to thank Tom Folliard for his significant contributions to CarMax over the last 23 years. We're very fortunate that he's still involved and will be our Chairman of our board. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with him. So Tom, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are, since I know there are no Boston sports teams playing at this time of the morning, thank you. Thank you from all of us here at CarMax.
Over these past few months, I've spent a lot of time on the road, visiting our stores and talking with our associates. I am incredibly proud of them. Our 22,000 associates across the country are doing an awesome job, delivering the best car shopping experience in the industry. The success of our company is due to our great associates, and I'm committed to maintaining our strong workplace culture. I'm also very excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. In addition to our great associates, we have a top-notch management team here at the home office, CarMax Auto Finance, and in all of our stores to lead us into the future.
More than 20 years ago, CarMax was founded to fundamentally change the way used car buying is done. We have revolutionized the used car buying experience, and our brand offer continues to resonate with customers. Now we're focused on extending that revolutionary experience. We're in a unique position to leverage our core strength, which is the exceptional customer experience our associates are known for, and extend it into a state-of-the-art online experience.
We've launched a new website, we're testing new online shopping capabilities and we are continuing to build out a new technology infrastructure. All of these elements will ensure the entire car buying process is simple and seamless, both online and in our stores. And we are confident that our systems and processes put us in the best position to drive scalability and efficient execution nationwide.
Keep in mind, we still only reach about 65% of the U.S. population. We're committed to our national expansion, and we'll open 15 stores this year and 13 to 16 stores next year.
Now I'll take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter results before I turn the call over to Tom Reedy to address financing. Then I'll conclude with an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Our total used unit comps for the second quarter increased by over 3%, and total used units grew 7%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion, but it was partially offset by a decline in traffic. As we discussed last quarter, we believe our decrease in traffic was largely due to the continuation of less traffic from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were significantly stronger this quarter at over 8%.
When it comes to our total web traffic, it increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. Gross profit per used unit at $2,160 remained consistent with $2,166 in the second quarter of last year. Our wholesale units declined by 1.3% in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, we had 1 less Monday this quarter and approximately 55% of our auctions take place on Mondays.
Excluding the effect of the calendar shift, we estimate this year's wholesale vehicle unit sales growth would have been 1.4% year-over-year. Gross profit for wholesale units decreased to $870 compared to the gross profit per unit of $951 last second quarter. Last year's gross profit per unit was exceptionally strong, so it was a tough comparison.
Let me cover a few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of sales mix this quarter, 0- to 4-year-old vehicles fell to 76% compared to 79% last year as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles.
On the expense side, SG&A for the second quarter increased 11% to $366 million. This growth partially reflects the 11% or 16-store increase in our store base since the beginning of the second quarter of last year and an $18 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
Included in the share-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million, which relates, like every quarter, to nonexecutive compensation units that are settled in cash. This expense is driven by the change in CarMax's stock price during the quarter versus the change in the previous year's quarter. So the expense in this second quarter was based on a $5 increase in price versus a decrease of $10 in last year's second quarter.
The other $11 million included in share-based compensation expense is related to the board's decision to modify certain equity awards previously granted to Tom Folliard. These modifications effectively treated Tom as a retiree, even though he's somewhat younger, but he's far exceeded the service requirement, having been here for 23 years. These changes did not accelerate the original vesting of his awards or extend the original terms.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091843,1049557,"CarMax Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in th",532,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Consistent with recent quarters, we experienced a year-over-year increase in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and a decline across the lower end. This mix drove growth in the percentage of sales financed by CAF and growth in sales from customers who paid cash or bought their -- brought their own financing.
CAF's net penetration increased to 45.3% compared with 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 8% year-over-year to $1.4 billion due to a combination of CarMax's sales growth and our higher penetration. Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter by about 1 percentage point to 16.2%. While our Tier 2 lenders' performance, based on what we see on their conversion of customers to sales, continued to be strong, they were impacted by the decrease in volume for lower-end credit applications as well.
In addition to this lower volume, Tier 3 sales continue to be affected by credit tightening at one of our third-party lenders. Tier 3 sales mix was 9.5% of used unit sales compared to 13.7% in the same period last year. This level of decline does not represent further tightening from what we experienced, starting in the middle of Q1 of this year.
CAF income of $96 million represented a decrease of 2.3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to a higher provision for loan losses and a lower interest margin, partially offset by a 12% growth in average managed receivables to over $10 billion.
The year-over-year increase in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter reflected some unfavorable experience in the current quarter, the growth in receivables and the additional allowance that we booked based on our Q1 experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $110 million was 1.08% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.05% last quarter and 0.96% in prior year's second quarter. The allowance reflects the combination of both our experience in the quarter and adjustment for the overall portfolio based on what we've learned. This current level of loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and our portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.4%, similar to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. Total interest margin declined to 5.9% of average managed receivables compared to 6.2% in the second quarter of last year. The total interest margin, however, has been at about 5.9% for 3 consecutive quarters.
Now switching gears from CAF to CarMax. Like last quarter, interest expense is up year-over-year to $14 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to higher average debt levels, which, as we've discussed, are a deliberate component of our capital structure strategy, as well as the store lease extensions that we've previously discussed in our filings. During the second quarter, we took down the remaining $200 million of the private debt deal we closed in Q1, and we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $126 million.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

During the second quarter, we opened 3 stores: El Paso, Texas and Bristol, Tennessee, both of which were new markets for us. We also opened a third store in Boston. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we opened a store in Boise, Idaho, another new market for us. During the third quarter, we expect to open 5 more stores, 4 will be in current markets, including Philadelphia, Orlando and 2 in San Francisco. The fifth will be in Grand Rapids, a new market for us.
Last quarter, I talked about how we are testing different online components of the selling process to better understand and meet our customers' needs. I'd like to give you an update on those efforts.
I previously shared with you that we had rolled out a new adaptive, more intuitive website. The new website combines an upgraded and enhanced design with a seamless experience across all devices. We also upgraded the entire site to a state-of-the-art technology platform, which will allow us to more quickly innovate, test new capabilities and personalize the experience.
This is the first full quarter with the new website in place, and we are pleased with the performance so far. We've seen a positive response based on increased engagement activity such as inventory searches, viewing of car page details and creating personalized accounts. With our new site, we hope to continue to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale.
Second, we've been testing an online financing capability to help our customers get prequalified for a loan before they choose a specific vehicle. They can get prequalified for financing from any computer or mobile device and then finish their shopping experience more quickly in the store. We've expanded the pilot to 13 stores, and we are encouraged by the customer response. We are looking forward to rolling out the finished product to all our stores in the next couple of months, and we will provide you with an update next quarter.
Lastly, we've previously mentioned that we conducted a small test of home delivery. This allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We are now conducting another larger test in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through this test, we hope to learn the best ways to further operationalize this offering and deliver our hallmark exceptional customer service experience outside the store.
We believe no one is in a better position to deliver as much of the car buying experience online as the customer wants. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to give customers the ability to go between the digital experience and the in-store experience whenever and however they would like. CarMax's national footprint, unparalleled inventory and brand strength position us to continue to lead the industry.

We're not making any prognostications about the future and continued movement. And obviously, we will keep a close eye on it and adjust our strategies, if it merits that. I mean, as I think you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, or sequentially, it's not that big of an uptick. If you look year-over-year, it's a pretty significant jump, about -- but about half of that jump, we would have expected based on the fact that the portfolio has grown 12% and the experience that we had from -- in Q1, we incorporated into our provision for this quarter. So there was some unexpected unfavorable experience, but much of the change in the provision shouldn't be too unexpected, even though it was a pretty big step-up."

If you kind of look at our degradation year-over-year, we'd estimate that about 40% of the decline is due to application volume, and the remaining 60% is really due to change in behavior with our lenders, one lender in particular. So as far as stabilization, I think what we saw happen last quarter was during the quarter, during Q1, Santander, who's been in the press about -- and talking about how they're pulling back in different spaces, we saw a change in behavior there in the middle of the quarter, so we didn't really get a full quarter's impact of it in Q1. But since May, we've seen stable performance in the Tier 3 space. That doesn't -- I'm not speaking to the future, but we've seen 4 months of stability, and this quarter reflects kind of a full quarter of the new world as it was since those changes. As far as the changes, it's more of the same that we talked about in the past as we've seen changes in lender behavior. Our global approval rate is still well above 90%. But the quality of the offers and the attractiveness of those offers to the customers, it becomes worse if they're asking for more down or if they're asking for stipulations like proof of income, et cetera. And so that's the nature of the tightening that we've seen."

I mean, they're -- we're not -- Santander is not pulling back because they're delighted with what they're seeing in that portfolio. And when we think about that space, there's more to it than just the profit. There's the impact on our brand. There's the impact on our reputation with customers. And in this current environment, I think we're happier being thought of as a prime lender that has some activity in the Tier 3 space. We're learning from it. We're learning how to originate. We're learning how to service. We're learning how to perform, and we're building a track record in that space. But we haven't determined that now is the time to go forward with anything greater.

As we think about the hypothesis for what could be driving this, it's not apparent to us that there is a course of -- or a change in our action in this segment that would be appropriate. Remember, we've always talked about this business as incremental, and we already invested $1,000 per car into this channel in order to realize 1/2 -- 1/3 to 1/2 of the profit of a Tier 2 or a CAF deal. So we can speculate that -- would our lenders like to see more money from us in order to be more aggressive? I'm sure they would say they'd try. But I don't think we're interested in increasing the -- or decreasing our margin any further on this space. And we're certainly not interested in increasing prices to subsidize our Tier 3 partners. That's just not good business for us. I think the investments Bill discussed in our online capabilities and customer experience are a high priority for us. And looking at the business, absent the effect of the Tier 3 space, we're not -- we're pretty pleased with the momentum we see at the 8% comps. And in the longer term, growing off of the base of 45% CAF and 10% Tier 3 is a much more profitable equation than when we were seeing Tier 3 near 20% a couple of years ago. So I don't know what this makes of the overall environment, but like I said, I don't think there's any action or course we would change to try to address the phenomenon we're seeing."

And then really important to that also is that we want to make sure that the experience meets our high standards of great customer service that we have in the store. So that's really what we're trying to understand with this piece. It's too early to really talk about any type of results. On the search engine optimization, obviously, the big part of the web redesign is making sure that when customers search for us, that we come up organically. Now those are the -- that's the best thing, when you don't have to pay for a lead and you just automatically come up on the first page. And what I can tell you, if I look at over a year ago -- about a year ago, if you searched for us in some generic terms, we didn't show up on the first page. We were, in some cases, several pages below the first page. And if you search something, you typically don't go many pages past the first page. I'm pleased to tell you that we made great strides.

I think -- like I said before, I think subprime can be in the eye of the beholder and of CAF, a wide spectrum of folks. And the FICO score is not the only indicator that lenders use to determine creditworthiness and whether they're going to advance. So some of what CAF does falls into that lower end. A good amount of Tier 2 falls in that lower end. And clearly, all of Tier 3, unless there's something really funny about the deal, fall into that lower end of the FICO. So as I said, Tier 2s, their volume has been impacted, but their behavior, we're very happy with."

For today's call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing. And then I'll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives.
As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4%, and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic.  We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities, which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwind from Tier 3 sales. We estimate used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. 
Our total Web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while Web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website with increased activity, such as engagement with a search tool and car pages as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale. 
Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession. 
We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $2,155 compared to $2,160 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year's third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year's wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison.
A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles fell this quarter to 78% compared to 81% last year, once again, as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18-store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year's third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091858,1103796,"CarMax Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this",457,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this continuing in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace, and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix drove growth in cash net penetration, which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year's third quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and a higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you'd expect, the higher credit mix applications [ph] drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or bought their own financing. 
Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our Tier 2 lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we have observed in customer conversion. Tier 3 sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors credit hiking [ph] early in the year and lower application volumes.  Performance of our Tier 3 partners, however, has been consistent since the middle of Q1. 
GAAP income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased, and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly.
During the third quarter, we continue to see higher loss experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year's third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. And during the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

First, as we discussed last quarter, we've been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get pre-qualified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide, and we're pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads. 
Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demand and operational scalability while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. 
The last update is regarding a one store test we'll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online, and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. 
While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost-conscious in eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we're going in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Like last quarter, I remain confident that we will continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience. 
With that, I will open up the call for questions. So, Victoria?"

So remember, we've been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume of a lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease will start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tiding we saw was in mid-Q1 from our Tier 3, one of our Tier 3 lenders. Since that time, they have been behaving very consistently if we look at conversion of customers in the Tier 3 space since missed the middle of Q1. It's been very consistent. It's below last year, but it's been consistent. So yes, all else equal in a row, you start to see this rolling over that on a year-over-year basis.

But since you did mention it, I'm excited about it, and I wish them well. 
For today's call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing. And then I'll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives.
As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4%, and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities, which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwind from Tier 3 sales. We estimate used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. 
Our total Web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while Web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website with increased activity, such as engagement with a search tool and car pages as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale. 
Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession. 
We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $2,155 compared to $2,160 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year's third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year's wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison.
A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles fell this quarter to 78% compared to 81% last year, once again, as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18-store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year's third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this",456,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this continuing in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace, and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix drove growth in cash net penetration, which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year's third quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and a higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you'd expect, the higher credit mix of applications drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or bought their own financing. 
Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our Tier 2 lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we have observed in customer conversion. Tier 3 sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors credits hiking early in the year and lower application volumes. Performance of our Tier 3 partners, however, has been consistent since the middle of Q1. 
GAAP income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased, and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly.
During the third quarter, we continue to see higher loss experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year's third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. And during the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Late in the current fourth quarter, we expect to open 4 more stores: 2 in our Los Angeles market, 1 in Murrieta, centralized production auction facilities this quarter, both in Southern California. In addition, we plan to open 2 small format stores in the fourth quarter both in new markets: Boldo, Alabama and Albany, New York. 
Next, I'd like to give an update on our new online offerings and the tests we are conducting to continue to advance the customer experience. First, as we discussed last quarter, we've been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get pre-qualified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide, and we're pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads. 
Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demand and operational scalability while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. 
The last update is regarding a one store test we'll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online, and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. 
While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost-conscious in eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we're going in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Like last quarter, I remain confident that we will continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience. 
With that, I will open up the call for questions. So, Victoria?"

As far as the leasing, I said earlier, we're seeing more vehicles come back from the leasing channels, and we think it'll continue through next year and even into the year after that. And I think we've proven over time that we've been able to hold our margins throughout many different cycles. Now the only caveat that I would give there is you know we constantly do testing.

And we will have the ability to not only do more of the transaction online, but it will be a seamless integration into the store. And I think that's really what we're focused on. In addition to giving the customers the ability to do everything, it really is, okay, you want to do part of it online, let's make sure it's a great experience. And then when you walk into the store, we just pick up from where you left off, and that's really what we're focused on. I think that's really where the consumer demand is going to be in the near term."

As far cycling, I think in the current period right now, we'll begin to cycle over the trend we began observing in traffic. So remember, we've been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume at the lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease, we'll start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tiding we saw was in mid-Q1 from our Tier 3 -- at one of our Tier 3 lenders. Since that time, they have been behaving very consistently. If we look at conversion of customers in the Tier 3 space since mid -- the middle of Q1, it's been very consistent. It's below last year, but it's been consistent. So yes, all else equal in April, you'll start to see us rolling over that on a year-over-year basis. In the Tier 2 space, it's almost exactly the opposite phenomenon. Conversion has been consistently better than last year since the first quarter. And as I mentioned, they're doing a great job of converting the volume that they see. A lot of -- the mix dynamic we're seeing is -- a lot of it's from the customer traffic coming through the door. That's why CAF is up. That's why other is up, and that's why the other -- the Tier 2 and 3 are down."

And while we likely started feeling the phenomenon a little earlier, the data is telling us that the lower and lower middle part of the credit spectrum has seen a year-over-year decline in recent quarters for everybody. As far as the higher credit folks and the growth there, our data appears to show that we are -- we're growing a little bit stronger than the rest of them.

But since you did mention it, I'm excited about it, and I wish them well. 
For today's call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing. And then I'll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives.
As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4%, and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities, which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwind from Tier 3 sales. We estimate used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. 
Our total Web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while Web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website with increased activity, such as engagement with a search tool and car pages as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale. 
Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession. 
We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $2,155 compared to $2,160 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year's third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year's wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison.
A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles fell this quarter to 78% compared to 81% last year, once again, as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18-store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year's third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
356805,310091858,1103970,"CarMax Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this",456,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this continuing in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace, and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix drove growth in cash net penetration, which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year's third quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and a higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you'd expect, the higher credit mix of applications drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or bought their own financing. 
Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our Tier 2 lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we have observed in customer conversion. Tier 3 sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors credits hiking early in the year and lower application volumes. Performance of our Tier 3 partners, however, has been consistent since the middle of Q1. 
GAAP income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased, and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly.
During the third quarter, we continue to see higher loss experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year's third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. And during the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

In addition, we plan to open 2 small format stores in the fourth quarter both in new markets: Mobile, Alabama and Albany, New York. 
Next, I'd like to give an update on our new online offerings and the tests we are conducting to continue to advance the customer experience. First, as we discussed last quarter, we've been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get pre-qualified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide, and we're pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads. 
Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demand and operational scalability while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. 
The last update is regarding a one store test we'll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online, and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. 
While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost-conscious and eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we're growing in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Like last quarter, I remain confident that we will continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience. 
With that, I will open up the call for questions. So, Victoria?"

I think competition is hot in both the online space and the traditional. And I think our challenge is to make sure that we continue to leverage the equities that's made us successful and make them even better and leverage our data and our processes and our systems and our people to continue to widen the gap between us and our competition. And like I said earlier, I mean, we've got 23 years worth of experience and 23 years worth of data, and we're leveraging that data and tapping into it in ways that we haven't been able to and haven't done in the past. So although the competition is hot and heavy, we feel really good about the position that we're in. And I think, ultimately, to be as successful as we can be, we do need to make sure that we can be in the online space. But equally important is we've got to be in the brick-and-mortar space. I think you have to do both very, very well, and I think we're positioning ourselves to do just that."

As far cycling, I think in the current period right now, we'll begin to cycle over the trend we began observing in traffic. So remember, we've been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume at the lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease, we'll start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tithing we sought was in mid-Q1 from our Tier 3 -- one of our Tier 3 lenders. Since that time, they have been behaving very consistently. If we look at conversion of customers in the Tier 3 space since mid -- the middle of Q1, it's been very consistent. It's below last year, but it's been consistent. So yes, all else equal in April, you'll start to see us rolling over that on a year-over-year basis. In the Tier 2 space, it's almost exactly the opposite phenomenon. Conversion has been consistently better than last year since the first quarter. And as I mentioned, they're doing a great job of converting the volume that they see. A lot of -- the mix dynamic we're seeing is -- a lot of it's from the customer traffic coming through the door. That's why CAF is up. That's why other is up, and that's why the other -- the Tier 2 and 3 are down."

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today on short notice. We scheduled this call to wish you all happy holidays, to make sure you've seen our beautiful new website launched on November 30, to celebrate adding another 1 million Stubs members since September and to congratulate Disney on Rogue One.
Now let's turn to any questions you may have. No, maybe there's a little more to talk about.
So needless to say, we are in a good mood in Leawood, Kansas. Today is a glorious day and another great day for AMC. As you know, earlier this morning, the Department of Justice completed its review of our pending Carmike Cinemas transaction. We are very pleased to announce and to report to you that AMC and the Department of Justice have, in fact, reached a settlement that will allow our acquisition of Carmike Cinemas to proceed. As you know, in November, Carmike shareholders voted by a significant margin in favor of the transaction. The DOJ approval today was the last remaining regulatory hurdle needed to be crossed. And therefore, we are working expeditiously to complete the transaction as quickly as possible and almost certainly before year-end. Naturally, we will alert you via press release when the acquisition closes.
As we maintained since the beginning, ultimately this combination of AMC and Carmike will expand our presence throughout the country, creating the single-largest movie theater exhibitor in the United States. But even more importantly, it will allow us to introduce our successful guest experience initiatives proven at AMC to tens of millions of new customers, improving the moviegoing experience for them. It's also expected to broaden our appeal with moviegoers, with more people having access to the AMC Stubs loyalty program redesigned in July and our new website www.amctheatres.com and smartphone apps launched just 3 weeks ago.
We continue to believe that this transaction combines 2 great companies with complementary geographic footprints. AMC focuses on large urban areas, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and on the West Coast, while Carmike's America's hometown theater chain strategy serves midsized and nonurban areas, primarily in the South and the Southeast. We believe this diversification will further be beneficial because while there is wide appeal for all film genres in AMC theaters, over the years, we have seen that film genres play differently in different geographic areas. Fast action, R-rated movies tend to play better in the larger urban areas, while family-oriented, faith-based and military movies tend to play better in the nonurban and rural markets. The AMC-Carmike combination should help smooth out some of that volatility and allow us to provide something for every moviegoer.
In total, we are as confident today as we were back in March when this transaction was first announced, that the growth potential for AMC is enhanced by joining forces with Carmike Cinemas. As part of the DOJ approval process and as expected, AMC has agreed to certain conditions on which the transaction can move forward. There are 2 primarily areas of focus: theater divestitures and our activity with National CineMedia and Screenvision. Let's review the divestitures first.
Just to get your bearings, prior to any divestitures, AMC currently has 392 operating theaters in the United States and Carmike 271, for a combined starting U.S. total of 663 theaters. As originally contemplated in the agreement to acquire Carmike, we will be divesting 2 theaters from the Starplex acquisition of December 2015 that ironically we sold to Carmike just 12 months back. The completion of the sale of these 2 former Starplex theaters will take place prior to the closing of the Carmike transaction. As part of the agreement with the Department of Justice, we were quite pleased to learn that AMC will be required to divest theaters in only 15 overlapping local trading areas in which we'll operate on a combined basis. We actually have a choice of which theaters to divest in these specified markets, so the exact number of theaters to be sold is not yet finalized. We do expect though that we'll -- it will be a total of between 15 and 20 divested theaters, including the 2 formerly of Starplex. The divested theaters will come mostly from the existing Carmike circuit. The theater-level cash flows of the theaters to be divested are consistent with our original divestiture expectations and in our view, are modest in the single digit millions of dollars. We already have identified a buyer for the 2 former Starplex locations. The remaining theaters are expected to be sold in the next 60 days.
Now let's move over to the NCM and Screenvision requirements in the DOJ settlement. There are 2 primary components, both reflecting the Justice Department's desire to preserve competition in preshow advertising essentially between NCM, who offers preshow advertising at AMC theaters, and Screenvision, who does so at Carmike's theaters. First, our ownership in NCM and Screenvision; second, the theaters participating in each of the 2 networks.
On ownership. AMC has been a founding owner of NCM since 2005, and our current ownership position is about 17%. With the completion of the Carmike acquisition, we expect our NCM ownership will increase to over 25%. Carmike owns approximately 20% of Screenvision, a stake that we will be inheriting.
Under the terms of the settlement we just reached with the DOJ, AMC will sell down over the next 30 months our ownership stake in NCM to no more than 4.99%. During that 30-month period, there are also 2 interim thresholds. A year from now, our ownership must be no more than 15%. And 2 years from now, it must be no more than 7.5%. We intend to work closely with NCM and do our utmost to handle these NCM stock sales in an orderly fashion over that 2.5-year period.
We're not at all troubled by this NCM share sell-down. We greatly appreciate our solid long-term working relationship with NCM, which is well protected for both of AMC and for NCM through a detailed operating contract that runs through the year 2037. The sale of the NCM shares will, of course, generate significant cash proceeds, which we expect to use to delever the AMC balance sheet and to invest in deploying strategic growth initiatives at our theaters. Additionally, while we don't comment on merger rumors and such, there always is the possibility of these monies helping us to fund additional acquisitions for AMC in the future. Importantly, whether reducing our debt, reinvesting in our own circuit or exploring other acquisitions, we believe these uses have the potential to be the best allocation and deployment of our capital.
It goes without saying that there will be tax payments associated with the selling of those NCM shares. However, given our net operating loss carryforwards and some higher basis NCM shares, we do not expect the near-term tax implications to be significant. The possibility also exists that a future tax impact could be further reduced depending upon the new administration's success in achieving tax reforms.
In addition to the reduction of our NCM share ownership, we will be giving up our one NCM board seat and our right to select an independent director. We also will be waiving founding member governance rights, but this is of not concern. NCM is a well-run company in our opinion. We simply do not believe that we need ownership or board protection given our long-term, multi-decade, contractual relationship which endures.
As it relates to our ownership in Screenvision, we're not required to sell any shares. However, we do expect to convert about half of our current Screenvision shares to be of nonvoting status.
The second DOJ requirement relates to new screens that accrue to Screenvision and to NCM and a minimal transfer of screens soon between the NCM and Screenvision networks. We expect that Screenvision will pick up service at 5 of Carmike's current Sundance Cinema locations that have not as of yet implemented an in-theater advertising program. The DOJ is further requiring that we transfer approximately 19 theaters to the Screenvision advertising network that are currently operating under AMC's NCM contract. We'll have 60 days to effect this transfer. We will, of course, work very closely with both NCM and Screenvision to minimize any disruption to their businesses from these changes.
In saying this, I think it's important to note that Screenvision is picking up theaters now prior to divestiture, which is good for Screenvision. As for NCM, there's also good news. Eyeballs at current AMC NCM theaters have the potential to grow markedly due to the attendance gains that result from our previously announced goal of renovating over the next 2 years another 1/3 of AMC's current theaters with plush recliner seating. Additionally, going forward, AMC retain -- sorry, additionally going forward, NCM retains its exclusive contractual access to the future growth in the number of AMC theaters in the U.S. that we build or acquire after the Carmike transaction. Those future theaters will operate under the NCM contract unless committed and encumbered to Screenvision or another advertising provider if, as and when acquired.
As you sort through all this, it may be helpful to remind you that under the terms of our existing NCM service agreement, which will remain in effect for the next 2 decades going forward, we will continue to receive a monthly theater access fee for participation in the NCM network. Based on our NCM ownership at the time, we still will be entitled to receive quarterly dividends and dividend distributions of excess cash. However, should we elect to take NCM shares for the Screenvision attendance that result from the Carmike transaction, we will also be required to pay NCM a quarterly make-whole payment to compensate NCM for the Screenvision attendance related to Carmike. Similarly, we, AMC, should continue to enjoy the economic benefits that accrue to Carmike now under its Screenvision contract, which will also continue over the long haul through July 1 of 2042, in fact. We look forward to establishing a fine relationship with Screenvision.
In closing, I would especially like to thank the staff and executives of the Department of Justice for their diligence and thoughtfulness in reviewing this transaction. We believe that tens of millions of moviegoers will reap the benefits of AMC's future investments in the Carmike theaters. And in our opinion, the DOJ's approval supports that belief. As we extend our appreciation, we also are grateful to David Passman and the people of Carmike who worked so hard and well this year under difficult circumstances in getting us to this position.
In summary, I simply cannot contain my enthusiasm that the Carmike acquisition is now clear to go. This is another exciting day for all of us here at AMC in 2016. One of our key priorities for AMC that we announced at the beginning of the year was to grow our company through acquisition. Well, in 2016, we certainly have done what we said we would do. On November 30, we completed the acquisition of Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group, since renamed Odeon. And our teams have already been on the ground since Day 1 in Europe, working with our colleagues at Odeon to integrate the U.K. and Europe's largest movie exhibition circuit into the growing world of AMC. Now today on December 20, we've received the final regulatory approval needed to complete the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, and the closing on this transaction is imminent.
Our executives, managers and staff in the United States have worked tirelessly this year on integration planning. I can tell you categorically that in my view they are talented and dedicated, they are very well prepared and they are raring to go. What excites our teams is that upon completion of the Carmike transaction, AMC will become the largest movie exhibitor in the United States, the largest movie exhibitor in Europe and the largest movie theaters exhibitor in the world. Now we strive not only to be the biggest, but also to be the best.
Thank you for listening. I'd like to turn the call back to the operator so that Craig and I can take your questions."

And what have you found from kicking the tires on the assets over the past, what's it, nearly a year now? And then secondly with regards to National CineMedia, do you have the ability to say you want cash or shares as part of the Carmike transaction? Because I think that would be about 18 million shares, which you would then, of course, have to sell. So I'm just curious, who has the option to say either cash or shares will be delivered? And then did you have the option to either divest all of Screenvision and instead keep all of what you have in National CineMedia? Or did the government specifically want you to reduce your position in National CineMedia?"

In terms of what we've learned over the year, the blessing of the -- we announced the transaction in March. It's now December. So we've had plenty of time to look at the Carmike circuit and to plan for the integration. And I guess before I talk about renovations and reseats and what we've learned, I probably should talk about timing because it's -- because we've had so much time to plan well, we're going to cut over the first Carmike theater into AMC in the second week of January. And we're essentially going to use the second half of January to pilot at about 13 Carmike theaters AMC systems, make sure they're working smoothly, that our cutover of these first, let's call it, a dozen theaters or so is working seamlessly. We expect that to be the case. And therefore, starting February 1, we're going to be bringing the Carmike theaters into the AMC network very fast, which means getting our POS system in place, switching the theaters and showtimes from the Carmike website to the AMC website, changing people's points earning capability from Carmike's loyalty program to our loyalty program. That's going to move at, I think, a fairly blistering pace. We expect to be able to get all 271 of Carmike theaters, less whatever number we divest, into the AMC system by the end of April or May. So that's a pretty quick move. In terms of what we've learned, we've learned that for all of our talk, including in my prepared remarks, about we're in big markets and they're in small markets and we're -- actually, there are -- there is a big chunk of theaters that overlaps. And so what we've decided to do is proceed with what we're calling a 2-brand strategy, 3 brands if you count the Dine-In Theatres as its own sub-brand. Some theaters that will be branded and taken to the public as AMC and other theaters that have less visitation that might have slightly lower service standards, brand it as a second brand. But what we've found is that there are plenty of Carmike theaters that are substantial enough in their visitation or locales to graduate, so to speak, into the AMC brand. And there are a lot of AMC theaters that also have lower visitation levels that we think are more like a Carmike theater than like an AMC theater. So I would expect that in excess of 50 current AMC theaters will move into the second brand and in excess of 100 Carmike theaters will move into the AMC brand. Now just because they're different brands doesn't mean that guest satisfaction will be lower in brand 2 than on brand 1. It just means that we'll offer different levels of service, amenities and price points and better marry consumer expectations to the reality of what's being offered. So I think that's what we've learned. Another -- with one additional caveat. The other thing that we've learned is that when you have low-visitation theaters, those theaters tend to be lower-margin theaters. And therefore, being maniacal about cost management is extremely important. And for that reason, again, we're pleased by the 2-brand strategy because we'll have one set of operating standards for the AMC theaters, another set of operating standards for the second brand theaters. And that will allow us to be more focused on managing cost at each brand at the appropriate level. And I would point out that I think if you look at our financial results in 2016, AMC has demonstrated this year a very good ability to manage its costs. And that's something we're proud of, and that will continue going forward. So preserving the cost structure of these lower-visitation theaters is also important. In terms of when we can get started, there's a small get started and a big get started. The small get started is we would like there to be what we call consumer clues at every single Carmike theater, whether it's in the AMC brand or the second brand, that things got better for moviegoers because AMC has arrived as its owner. So as an example, it is our intention to get Coke Freestyle machines in 100% of Carmike theaters with their 100 choices of drink flavors because we know that consumers love the drink machines from Coke and they love the variety of flavors and they like the free refills. And that's something that we think we can get done across the entire Carmike network by, let's say, the end of June. If that slips a little bit into July or August, so be it, but the vast, vast majority, if not all, of the Carmike system would be done by June 30. In terms of the larger issue, which is the larger getting started -- well, and by the way, another issue with the smaller getting started is signage. We are going to put the appropriate AMC signage up at the appropriate Carmike theaters as soon as we can in 2017. In terms of the big getting started, I think what you're still thinking about is recliner seats and full-blown theater renovations. We have identified that there are an easy 50 to 100 Carmike theaters that are capable of supporting an AMC-style renovation. I think you'll see those back-end loaded more in 2018 and '19 than before, but it's not inconceivably that we could get some theaters done at the end of '17. On the issue of did the DOJ want us to sell off Screenvision entirely, I think I would say that the exact opposite was true. The -- throughout this whole process, the Department of Justice has been very interested in preserving competition between NCM and Screenvision. We pledged to facilitate that competition by maintaining Screenvision actively at some of our theaters and NCM actively at some of our theaters. So they did not want us to go to an all-NCM shop or an all-Screenvision shop. They wanted us to have a foot in both camps so that both NCM and Screenvision can prosper. As for your third question, I'll give it to Craig."

This is the same comment we've been making about AMC since my first conference call with you all back in January that AMC is a company with limited float. NCM is a company with limited trading volume. It's our personal opinion that our shares will trade better and their shares will trade better when institutional investors know that they can amass a position and to get in and get out at their whim without moving the market. So we're -- just as we're quite pleased there was a lot of equity issued to Odeon and Carmike in the transactions, which will ultimately increase our trading volumes and float, we think this is a great opportunity for NCM to see its float increase and its public liquidity increase and its trading volumes increase.

When -- in fact, when I was doing my back of the envelope in January, February, March, I thought the divestitures would be 15 to -- somewhere between 15 and 35. And so we were coming in at the very low end of that range. Now having said that, we did spend 8 months with the Justice Department of the United States. And I will tell you that they work on behalf of the taxpayers quite skillfully and would point out to you that if we're not able, for some reason, to port over 19 theaters to -- from NCM to Screenvision, we could conceivably have to divest an additional 19 theaters. I think there's low odds of that happening because I think we can negotiate something with NCM and Screenvision that's satisfactory to all 3 -- all 4 parties, us, NCM, Screenvision and the Department of Justice. So I think at the end of the day will be 15 to 20. And yes, that's a good number from our standpoint. In terms of the global scale, and you're correct about your film rental splits, they're between 52% and 54% depending upon who the operator is and what the quarter is. I've been very careful since I got here. Other people in the industry have enjoyed talking about who has more clout with whom, studios or exhibitors. Who can smash down the other into getting higher film rent splits, if you're a studio fan or a lower film rent splits if you're a theater operator fan. I've never engaged in that talk publicly. Clearly, the fact that we have global scale will help our position at the table. But I've said since I got here that my focus was on growing the pie for everybody and making more money for the studios and making more money for us and not focusing as much on how we divvy up the pie between us. And examples of that, that's why we work so hard to put in a new Stubs program, which has doubled the size of our database, which is allowing us to communicate with identified moviegoers 50 to 100 times a year, tell them they ought to go to a movie this weekend. It's why we just spent $11 million on creating what we think is gorgeous new website and smartphone apps, which we believe is already doing a much better job in converting people from being browsers to buyers on the website and on their smartphones. And that's what I'd like us to talk about vis-à-vis studios, which is how we can increase the dollars that we bring in to the total AMC pie. We do think the fact that we're going to commit to renovate a significant number of AMC theaters and a significant number of Carmike theaters and a significant number of Odeon theaters is going to cause attendance at those theaters to increase. That's good for studios. That's good for us. So I'm not unaware of your question, and I think it's a legitimate one to be had. But I think diplomacy requires that my comments and my focus be about making more money for studios and making more money for AMC, rather than arguing between us about the split of what might be a static pie."

But since you did mention it, I'm excited about it, and I wish them well. 
For today's call, I will first review the key highlights of the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Tom Reedy to cover financing. And then I'll close the call before Q&A with a brief update on some of our new initiatives.
As you read in our press release this morning, our total used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 5.4%, and total used units grew by 9.1%. Total used unit comps were driven by a strong improvement in conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities, which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwind from Tier 3 sales. We estimate used unit comps for our non-Tier 3 customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. 
Our total Web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while Web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website with increased activity, such as engagement with a search tool and car pages as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally, to a sale. 
Our wholesale units declined by approximately 2% in the third quarter. This was driven by a decrease in appraisal traffic, partially offset by the growth in our store base and a higher buy rate. The decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession is affecting the supply of older vehicles. Remember, we saw this dynamic in our core retail business following the recession. 
We continue to maintain a consistent gross profit per used unit at $2,155 compared to $2,160 in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit per wholesale unit decreased to $900 compared to $949 in last year's third quarter. Again, as we reported in the second quarter, last year's wholesale gross profit per unit was the highest recorded in any third quarter. So like last quarter, it was again a tough comparison.
A few other topics before I turn the call over to Tom. As a percentage of our sales mix, 0 to 4-year-old vehicles fell this quarter to 78% compared to 81% last year, once again, as a result of higher customer demand for older and less expensive vehicles. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased 5.7% to $357 million. This growth partially reflects the 12% or 18-store increase in our base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. While we reported leverage of approximately $74 per unit, remember that our advertising expense in last year's third quarter was significantly higher due to the production and rollout of our new brand launch. Absent this increased spend in the prior year, leverage was modestly positive. Other overhead costs were up year-over-year, reflecting our continued investment in strategic initiatives. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this",456,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. In recent quarters, we have discussed the trend of year-over-year increases in credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum and less application volume at the lower end, and we saw this continuing in the third quarter. We recently purchased credit bureau data related to auto credit inquiries in the marketplace, and our analysis of this data suggests that this trend is not unique to CarMax. This application mix drove growth in cash net penetration, which increased to 45% compared with 43.3% in last year's third quarter.
Net loans originated in the quarter rose more than 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion due to a combination of CarMax sales growth and a higher penetration, partially offset by our lower average selling prices. In addition, as you'd expect, the higher credit mix of applications drove growth in the portion of sales where customers paid cash or bought their own financing. 
Tier 2 penetration fell year-over-year in the quarter to 15.7% from 16.9%. But just as we said last quarter, our Tier 2 lenders continue to provide strong offers based on what we have observed in customer conversion. Tier 3 sales mix was 10.2% of used unit sales compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. This decrease in penetration continues to be due to the same factors credits hiking early in the year and lower application volumes. Performance of our Tier 3 partners, however, has been consistent since the middle of Q1. 
GAAP income fell 3.2% to about $89 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, while average managed receivables grew by 11% to $10.3 billion. The provision for loan losses increased, and the portfolio interest margin decreased very modestly.
During the third quarter, we continue to see higher loss experience. Our ending allowance for loan losses at $115 million was 1.1% of ending managed receivables compared to 1.08% last quarter and 0.97% in last year's third quarter. This level of losses is a departure from our experience in recent years. However, losses in the last several years have been quite favorable. The current level of loan loss reserve is consistent with our range of expectations given our origination strategy and portfolio mix.
For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was flat year-over-year at 7.3%. Total interest margin declined slightly to 5.8% of average managed receivables. This compared to 6% in the third quarter of last year and 5.9% sequentially from Q2. And during the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $199 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $1.7 billion remaining in our stock repurchase authorization. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

We also opened 4 stores in existing markets: Philadelphia, Daytona and 2 in San Francisco. Late in the current fourth quarter, we expect to open 4 more stores: 2 in our Los Angeles market, 1 in Murrieta, it will include a centralized production auction facilities this quarter, both in Southern California. In addition, we plan to open 2 small format stores in the fourth quarter both in new markets: Mobile, Alabama and Albany, New York. 
Next, I'd like to give an update on our new online offerings and the tests we are conducting to continue to advance the customer experience. First, as we discussed last quarter, we've been testing a new online financing capability that has helped our customers get pre-qualified for a loan. When we talked at the end of the second quarter, we were piloting this product in 13 stores. Towards the end of Q3, we successfully rolled this new capability out to all stores nationwide, and we're pleased with the early results, which includes increased leads. 
Second, we continue to test our home delivery offering in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a reminder, home delivery allows the customers to shop for and buy a car at their convenience without coming into the store. We continue to learn about the customer demand and operational scalability while also ensuring it meets our standards for an exceptional experience. 
The last update is regarding a one store test we'll be conducting in the fourth quarter. We plan to test a new digital solution for customers who are interested in getting an appraisal value for their vehicle by submitting their vehicle information online without having to come into the store. These initiatives position CarMax to deliver more of the car buying experience online, and we remain committed to giving the customers the ability to go between the digital and in-store experience whenever and however they would like. 
While we are constantly working to innovate and improve the business, we are also very focused on being cost-conscious and eliminating waste across the entire organization. We continue to look for new opportunities to ensure we're growing in a way that is in the best interest of our customers, associates and shareholders. 
Like last quarter, I remain confident that we will continue to lead the industry. We have 23 years of experience to build upon to help us excel into the future. With our great associates, our national footprint, our unparalleled inventory, brand strength and continued focus on improving the customer experience both online and in-store, no one is in a better position than CarMax to fully deliver the best car buying experience. 
With that, I will open up the call for questions. So, Victoria?"

And then also, as you look at this leasing bubble that's coming over the next 3 years, kind of where do you think we are in that increase in supply? And as you think about those 2 legs of supply increases, what you think you can do as far as holding your grosses? Are you going to stay committed to this $2,100 to $2,200 range as we see that increase in supply really pick up?"

So on the first part of the question about the stop sales, look, I don't really think that's much of an impact. Because there's lots of dealers who've been selling vehicles that have open recalls while you've got the franchise dealers that cannot -- while the manufacturers are saying, hey, you can't sell it for that franchise, they still sell other non-brand franchise at those stores. So for me, that's not really -- I don't really see that as either a positive or negative. I think it's just continuing on. As far as the leasing, I said earlier, we're seeing more vehicles come back from the leasing channels, and we think it'll continue through next year and even into the year after that. And I think we've proven over time that we've been able to hold our margins throughout many different cycles. Now the only caveat that I would give there is you know we constantly do testing. And if we think that moving that margin down would more than pay for itself in units, then we would look at that. And so we'll continue to test, but we feel confident that we can continue to maintain those gross profit margins."

As far cycling, I think in the current period right now, we'll begin to cycle over the trend we began observing in traffic. So remember, we've been talking for several quarters about seeing fewer application volume at the lower end of the credit spectrum. That started somewhere around this time last year. So that portion of the decrease, we'll start to see some cycling. As I mentioned in my comments, the most recent tithing we sought was in mid-Q1 from our Tier 3 -- one of our Tier 3 lenders. Since that time, they have been behaving very consistently. If we look at conversion of customers in the Tier 3 space since mid -- the middle of Q1, it's been very consistent. It's below last year, but it's been consistent. So yes, all else equal in April, you'll start to see us rolling over that on a year-over-year basis. In the Tier 2 space, it's almost exactly the opposite phenomenon. Conversion has been consistently better than last year since the first quarter. And as I mentioned, they're doing a great job of converting the volume that they see. A lot of -- the mix dynamic we're seeing is -- a lot of it's from the customer traffic coming through the door.

I think what you're seeing in Seattle is more driven by the market dynamics and what's available land-wise. Obviously, we're looking at our store prototypes. We've got the small format store out there. We -- you've seen we've opened more of those here more recently. I think it's something that we'll stay close to as we better understand the customer desire for transacting more and more parts of the transaction online. But I'll tell you, it's not like we have 1,000 stores around the country. We have 169 stores, and I think they're all strategically located. And the products we sell, you need space, and you need places to build those cars. So I feel very comfortable with our growth strategy, what we've done so far, and I feel very comfortable with what we've got in the pipeline currently."

And you said you also bought some market data that you were taking a look at. Just wondering if you could maybe put a few numbers behind what you're seeing at CarMax, how that compares to what you're seeing within the market. Are you kind of outperforming those increases? And then how we might think about higher credits being a larger percentage of your mix impacting loss rates going forward."

We'll see how it impacts loss rates going forward depending on the environment. It's way too early to tell. I'm not -- we're not in a position to give you any numbers regarding this, but I can give you a little color around what we looked at. We bought data related to auto inquiries, meaning, folks that are hitting the bureaus in conjunction with an application for credit for an automobile for the past several years both through submissions to captives and submissions or inquiries through the major dealer groups. And while we likely started feeling the phenomenon a little earlier, the data is telling us that the lower and lower middle part of the credit spectrum has seen a year-over-year decline in recent quarters for everybody. As far as the higher credit folks and the growth there, our data appears to show that we are -- we're growing a little bit stronger than the rest of them. But there could be a lot of factors between new car mix, used car mix, et cetera, that drive that. I don't know if there's anything to really take away from that."
