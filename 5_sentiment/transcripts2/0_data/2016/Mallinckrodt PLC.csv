And we're confident that our ongoi",1316,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. I'm very pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered a strong first quarter and fiscal 2016, building on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter. And we're confident that our ongoing excellence on execution will produce continued, steady progress throughout the remainder of the year. 
Net sales were up 20% for the quarter on an operational basis with exceptional commercial execution driving continued, steady volume gains in the Specialty Brands portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was strong as well, as Cole mentioned, up nearly 17% for the quarter. This strong performance, particularly in key Specialty Brands products, clearly demonstrates both the effectiveness of our strategy to create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders and our ability to execute on our plans. Based on this, we also raised our adjusted EPS guidance range for the remainder of fiscal 2016, which Matt will cover in more detail later. 
We continue to move at a rapid pace on a number of strategic fronts and made great progress in the quarter. In December, we announced our plan to acquire 3 commercial-stage, global specialty hemostasis brands to further diversify our hospital growth platform. I'm happy to report we closed on this transaction yesterday and are already moving forward with the rapid integration of these assets. We plan to market RECOTHROM immediately through our hospital-focused team and expect the U.S. launch of PreveLeak and RAPLIXA later in the second half of the year. Also in December, we held an investor briefing to reinforce the diversity and durability of our growing portfolio and highlight the broad investments, primarily in the branded portfolio, that clearly demonstrate our strategy to grow the company both organically and inorganically long term. 
We hired top-tier industry veterans in key positions, which will be instrumental to our growth in 2016 and beyond. Ron Lloyd, with 30 years of experience, 15 of those in the hospital market, joined as President of our hospital business reporting to me. And Dr. Tonde Otolana has become our Chief Medical Officer, coming to us with broad experience as a senior pharmaceutical executive, pulmonologist and former FDA officer. Tonde will report to Steve Romano, our Chief Scientific Officer. 
We've continued to deliver on our Acquire to Invest business model, reporting data from more than 2 dozen presentations from both clinical and health economic studies, 2/3 of which was for Acthar, to further define patient outcomes and strengthen and reinforce the value of our portfolio for the health care system. 
We finalized divestiture of the CMDS business, moving us another step forward in focusing the company on Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics. And last, but certainly not least, we executed on commercial priorities across our entire Specialty Brands segment to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth, enabling us to more than offset the ongoing market challenges we have in Specialty Generics. 
Simply stated, we know that the formula for continued success is to stick to our strategy of identifying and investing in under-resourced, highly durable assets, to expand patient access and accelerate volume growth and then maintain a laser focus on execution. And in the first quarter, we did just that. 
Now let's look at key products. Acthar delivered another solid quarter with net sales up nearly 8% in the period, well within our expected range of ongoing mid-single to low double-digit growth. Quarterly performance was principally driven through volume growth in rheumatology and pulmonology, and we're also seeing a positive prescribing rebound in more mature Acthar indications such as infantile spasms, where focused commercial execution is resulting in increased use in children with this devastating disease. 
And while it's still very early, we've seen strong physician interest in the lupus poster presented last fall at the American College of Rheumatology Conference. We expect that data to be published in the second half of this year, and when it is, believe that it will further reinforce Acthar's potential as a treatment for certain lupus patients with physicians and payers. 
Additionally, as you remember, a second open-label phase of this multisite trial have been ongoing, looking at both durability of patient response to Acthar and potential impact of Acthar treatment on reduction of steroid use in these patients. This phase of the study is now complete, and we're in the process of submitting it for potential presentation and publication later in the year. 
We continue to make good progress with regard to Acthar reimbursement. You'll remember that our long-term objective is to bring the majority of covered lives under contract. Today, Acthar commercial coverage stands at about 1/3 of the total eligible U.S. patient population under contract with key payers, and we continue to focus on expanding coverage with other major players. Looking through the remainder of fiscal 2016 and beyond, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to grow Acthar sales volume in key indications through focused activities like these. 
Now let me share a bit about INOMAX, our second-largest product. With integration fully complete, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter with net sales up 16% on a pro forma basis. This acceleration in historical growth rates reflects strong commercial execution and a focus on expanding our contracting model, which is beneficial to customers, and importantly, better ensures appropriate patients have ready access to INOMAX. 
Continuing with hospital products. In our first full quarter of ownership, we're also pleased with the performance of Therakos and expects its historical high single-digit growth to continue near term as we more fully integrate business into Mallinckrodt. Longer term, we see a number of strategic opportunities we can pursue to potentially accelerate that growth. 
Rounding out Specialty Brands. I'm happy to report that the first quarter saw continued volume recovery for OFIRMEV through strong execution by the commercial team and further penetration in key accounts. This makes us even more confident of a return to year-on-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016, driven by expanded OFIRMEV procedure penetration in the existing accounts, coupled with new account gains and recapturing volume and formulary status in other key accounts. 
Now turning to science and technology. In the first quarter, we made significant incremental investments in our key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, all consistent with our Acquire to Invest model. The substantial R&D spend includes initiation of 3 new clinical trials and patient enrollment and others. 
Let me share a number of additional highlights for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the 44-week open-label extension of our Phase IV company-sponsored trial of Acthar and lupus is complete, and we're working towards presenting that research later this year. We're also pleased to note registration of an Acthar company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite, double-blind trial in [indiscernible] product syndrome called FSGS on clinicaltrials.gov. We expect to see first patient, first visit in this trial in the coming months. 
We've also just enrolled the first subject into our company-sponsored, Phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in acute graft-versus-host disease for THERAKOS Photopheresis. This study, if successful, is a part of our long-term label-expansion strategy in the U.S. 
Turning to drug development. We continue to have meaningful dialogue with the FDA on our special protocol assessment request for the pivotal Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter terlipressin trial and plan to initiate the study later this year. 
On the business development front, we continue to actively identify opportunities to add commercial and developmental assets to our portfolio. Our key areas of focus remain in Specialty Brands, including hospital, autoimmune and rare diseases and Specialty Generics. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we'll continue using the time-proven industry methods we know will build value. Based on the traction we see in key areas, we're confident we'll reach our goals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, first quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong both strategically and financially, and Specialty Brands results, fueled by our Acquire to Invest, volume-driven strategy were exceptionally robust. 
Net sales from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were $915 million versus $768 million in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, representing operational growth of 20.3%. We continue to make significant progress on further diversifying our portfolio as evidenced by the transaction we just closed for the 3 hemostasis products. By the end of fiscal 2016, assuming our current business mix and expected growth rates, we believe we will be within a few hundred basis points of achieving our goal to have no single product represent more than 1/3 of our overall operating income. And importantly, we believe we'll reach this goal even if we do no other business development this year, and any additional product acquisitions we might make would only accelerate this time frame.  As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are raising our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $7.85 to $8.30. 
First quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $543 million, representing operational growth of 46%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and also in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX and Therakos. Acthar posted good results in the quarter with $287 million in net sales over the prior year quarterly revenue of $266 million, a 7.6% increase, and we continue to believe that the next several quarters will be at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range. 
We continue to focus on commercial execution and are very pleased with steady volume increases and the overall performance of Acthar we've seen in the past few quarters. But in the context of our view for the full year, a few reminders may be in order. First, in every year, the first calendar quarter, our second fiscal quarter, is a challenging time to drive volume for Acthar as compared to other quarters due to benefit resets and seasonality. We expect the seasonality to continue in 2016 and anticipate this will impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our second quarter. And with the particularly strong performance of Acthar in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we also anticipate the third quarter of fiscal 2016 will be a tough comparison. Finally, the most significant impact of gross-to-net contracting pressure for Acthar is still ahead of us. Balancing all these factors, we believe we will likely remain at the low end of our long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar for the next several quarters. 
We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $111 million in net sales as compared to $96 million in the equivalent pro forma quarter last year, a 16% increase year-over-year. With this recent strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis. But based on historical performance, we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to continue to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
For Therakos, while it's still early, we continue to anticipate high single-digit revenue growth in coming quarters and beyond. It is important to note that the Therakos platform has a larger international component than most other Mallinckrodt Specialty Brands comparators. And thus, results should be considered excluding foreign currency fluctuations. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, though revenue did not keep pace due to inventory adjustments. With this demand, as Mark mentioned, we are even more confident that we will achieve year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by the reclassification of Methylphenidate ER and increasing competition across a number of categories. Both factors were reflected in the first quarter with net sales of $258 million versus $284 million, representing an 8% year-over-year operational decline. Note that we're likely to see the toughest comparisons for Specialty Generics over the next couple of quarters, and year-over-year comparison should start to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The tough comparisons in Specialty Generics will also be putting pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales, which is likely to be lower than we saw this quarter. 
Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $104 million compared with $102 million in the prior year. Though we were pleased with the stronger-than-normal net sales in this segment for the quarter, these results were driven by onetime orders, and we expect to return to historical growth rates in the second quarter and beyond. 
Total company adjusted gross profit was $680 million, up from $559 million, with adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 74% compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. The strength of Acthar sales, in particular, contributed to these results. Yet, as I noted earlier, I'd caution that we're not likely to see that level of impact over the next couple of quarters when combined with the anticipated tough comparables from Specialty Generics. 
Total Mallinckrodt R&D spending in the quarter came in at 7% of net sales overall, with spending in our Specialty Brands segments significantly higher. Given our current trajectory, we expect fiscal 2016 Specialty Brands R&D spend as a percentage of net sales to approach double digits, given our focus on broad programs to generate clinical and health economic and outcomes research and data across the portfolio. 
We've also made continued progress in reducing SG&A, investing strategically, while at the same time focusing on cost management. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved 100 basis points to 24.9% for the quarter. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $98 million compared to $49 million. While this number rose significantly, consistent with our 2016 guidance, we remain comfortable that our strong cash flow will easily accommodate multiple facets of our growth strategy. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17% compared to 20% in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated more than $0.25 billion in free cash flow. We use the strong cash generation and proceeds from the divestiture of CMDS to repurchase $275 million in stock and also reduced total debt by just under $70 million. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $522 million. Our liquidity position remains quite strong and resilient, and we remain prepared to allocate capital towards additional share repurchases and potentially business development. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

With regards to Acthar sales, we're very pleased, obviously, with the quarter that we delivered here, consistent, I think, with the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that we're driving Acthar sales volume consistently across the board. The real focus, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and the real growth drivers today are pulmonology and rheumatology, where we're seeing double-digit growth rates in both of those segments of the business. If you look at the mix of Acthar business, again, historically, it's been about 30% in each of neurology, nephrology and rheumatology. And that mix is still roughly the same. The remaining 10% being all other. But we are seeing again continued good strength in pulmonology as an emerging opportunity for Acthar. We're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing, particularly in areas like lupus and in rheum and also in RA, and we would expect, over the coming years, that that's where you're going to see growth continuing to be driven in rheumatology and pulmonology. But we are also encouraged in certain areas of neurology, for example, I mentioned infantile spasms, where we've put additional refocus on that particular indication, and we're seeing a significant positive rebound in prescribing trends. Likewise, we see the same thing happening in nephrology that we're seeing a rebound in prescribing trends. And again, that's the result of significant commercial execution in those areas. We're also quite pleased with the fact that we continue to generate significant data in support of Acthar, and that's both clinical data, which we referenced. It's not just the lupus data, but it's a variety of other clinical mechanism of action and other studies that we're -- we continue to invest in and publish. And also health economic data. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we had over 2 dozen publications in total, and about 2/3 of those publications were focused on Acthar. So we think it's this data generation. We think it's the commercial execution. And then of course, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in managed care with regards to access. We continue to make good progress in contracting and ensuring that the majority of Acthar covered lives over time will be under contract. So across the board, we're very pleased with Acthar growth."

And that's why we're very confident that, in fact, we're going to see revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016. It's possible it could happen sooner than that if these trends continue. With regards, though, to the revenue bit, it lags a little bit the volume growth simply because, throughout the course of 2015, we did see some inventory adjustments in the channel. And that's not surprising given the fact that volume was a bit variable in 2015. Now that we think we've got a consistent volume trajectory going forward, we believe we've got the right level of inventory in the channel."

That's one of the reasons why we raised the guidance range this morning. But I do think you bring up a great point that cannot be repeated often enough. The accounting reality of 454 accounting convention, which we are on, is that once every 5.6 years, we do get a leap week that we will be experiencing in this year's fourth quarter. We've talked about that. That will tend to, everything else being equal, help our year-over-year comparisons this year. But by the same token, it's going to put some mathematical year-over-year comparison issues in 2017 in the fourth quarter, and it's important to everyone take that into account when you look at 2017. The only other thing I'd say is that we talked very specifically at our Investor Day to try to get everyone a long-term idea of where we're managing the business from a growth standpoint. We absolutely think that we can drive organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and that we can use organic and financial leverage to leverage the earnings number beyond that. Having said that, I can tell you there are a couple of people out there who don't seem to have heard that message. We've got a couple of people that have earnings growth in the high teens in 2017. I hope we're able to make that number. We're not going to talk about it at this point, but I think given the pressure of that extra week, that's something that I want everyone to take into account when you're accounting for 2017."

I would argue that both on the Specialty Brands as well as Specialty Generics that some of the price points paid have been relatively high when compared with historical frame. This being said, if you look at 2 of our acquisitions, in particular the multiples we paid, that would be the Ikaria acquisition and the Acthar acquisition in particular, despite the competition, we were able to pay a relatively low multiple premiums for those assets. So we've shown an affinity to go after assets that really fits strategically and may not be as competitive as some of the other assets that have been sold over time. As it relates to Specialty Generics, I'd say couple of things. The first is there are a number of assets out there that are available. There are more specialty generic opportunities out there now than there have been over the last, say, 24, 36 months. Even though there has been some consolidation, we still see an array of opportunities there. The second is, is some of the players in the industry that are consolidating are highly levered, and that may slow them down from further consolidation. You may have seen on our website, we put a reconciliation out there of our net debt leverage, which is at 3.5 right now. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had over $500 million as we came out of December. So we're in an enviable position, I would say, from a liquidity viewpoint, to pursue targets."

With regards to INOMAX, yes, we're exceptionally pleased with the performance of INOMAX. Clearly, with the 16% growth in the first quarter, I think this is evidence of the fact that the commercial execution under Mallinckrodt's ownership is really starting to drive some benefits here. In terms of our contracting strategy, this is something that's really good for patients, it's really good for customers and it's good for the business. This is something that customers like because it gives them good predictability and visibility to their potential expenditure. It's obviously great for patients. Keep in mind that INOMAX today has about a 50% market share in the neonatal intensive care patient population that we treat. And it's a therapy that, compared to many of the alternatives, has significant benefits. So we think there's an opportunity to drive a lot more patient penetration here. And one of the barriers historically has been that for some of the less sick patients, physicians are faced with the choice of, ""Do they use INOMAX? Or do they you something else that may be less expensive but may have poorer outcomes?"" Now we contract in a way that enables accounts to really have unlimited usage so they don't -- it removes that decision about what type of patient can benefit from INOMAX. Any patient that can benefit from INOMAX now can have access to it with this contracting strategy. So again, we think it's great for us, great for the accounts and very, very good for patients. And you're seeing that impact now in the results here in the first quarter. Historically, this has been a business, as we've said, that's been in the mid-single digit growth rate. And you've heard Matt's comments. With the performance that we're currently seeing, it's obvious that we'll be delivering at a growth rate this year significantly higher than that mid-single-digit growth rate. Longer term remains to be seen, but based on historical frame, you would expect that we will have a long-term growth rate for INOMAX in the mid-single-digit range. But clearly, in 2016, we're going to drive something significantly higher than that."

As it relates to the gross profit or gross margin, it was an exceptionally strong quarter, without question. A lot of that had to do with the strength in the Specialty Brands business, which was able to mute the effect of the supply disruption we had in nuclear as well as the pressure we see in Specialty Generics. This being said, take my comments to note from the prepared remarks, we hit a high water mark, at least in the short term, for gross profit. We see significant pressure in the second and third quarter. In the second quarter, you've got 2 things really going on. We see genetics getting much more pressure than what we saw in the first quarter combined with Acthar seasonality and benefit resets. and then in the third quarter, we have a tough comp for Acthar. As you know, the third quarter last year was a real strong quarter for us, and then we also say significant pressure in generics. So while we were pleased with the results we saw in the first quarter, the pressure is in the future quarters. As it relates to SG&A, you're absolutely right. We have dropped pretty significantly over the last 2 to 3 years. Coming out of the gates, we were in the low 30s, as you know. So I was very happy to see that we came in at 25%. This being said, I'd -- the spend will pick up more than likely in the latter part of this year. That's because we're investing in the hemostasis products to launch those, and we're also reinvesting in Acthar and Specialty Brands. So I would say while we're very pleased with the results, it was unusually low in the quarter, but I really like the zone that we're in right now."

And let's recognize that we've been very specific and deliberate about how we build our portfolio.

And we also look for assets that have exceptional durability. So it makes good sense for us to invest in these assets and focus on driving volume growth. And that's been our strategy from the beginning, and that continues to be our strategy going forward. So whether it's 3% patient penetration rate for Acthar, whether it's 10% to 15% penetration in CTCL for Therakos, we think there's significant opportunity for our products to drive growth by driving volume. In terms of market shares and those types of things, the long-term trajectory that we've given is consistent with what we've said a couple of times now, most recently at our Investor Day, that our objective is to drive long-term revenue growth in the mid-single digits on an organic basis and that we would drive EPS at a rate higher than that.

And that's what our strategy, our contracting strategy is all about, is to make it more accessible and easier for accounts to use INOMAX in more patients that are eligible. And that's to the benefit of the patients. And we think, at least in the near term, the opportunity is through that opportunity to access more patients through our contracting. We believe that we have placements in the majority of the significant NICUs across the country. There may be some opportunities for us to drive additional volume and revenue with some indications, with some label expansion indications we have in markets outside the U.S. For example, we got CV vindication in both Japan and Australia. Those are relatively smaller markets, but there's an opportunity for us to drive revenue there. But longer term, we think there may be an opportunity to further expand INOMAX usage by expanding the label and potentially penetrating into lower-level NICUs. But the primary opportunity, we believe, over the long term, is just to make INOMAX more accessible to more patients and to drive that current 50% patient penetration rate that we have today significantly higher."

As it relates to debt, you'll see this in the details that we file in the Q shortly. We repurchased $26 million of our debt on the open market. We paid down the revolver to the tune of about $100 million, but we also drew on our AR securitization program, and that led to roughly a $70 million decrease in debt.

But for now, until we see some of that stabilizing, we think it's probably wiser to be conservative on this. And we continue to be internally. And we would want you to be as well. You're absolutely right. Everything else being equal, that extra week in the fourth quarter should give us a little bit of boost, so we might be a little bit better there.

We continued to believe very strongly that Acthar is an exceptionally durable product, and I can't emphasize enough how much we're playing the long game with Acthar in both our execution -- commercial execution strategy, our managed care strategy and our data generation strategy. We believe that this is a product that can grow consistently and steadily over the long term as a result of investing in this product. Again, as we've said before, we don't really know exactly what the pathway may be, or if there is a pathway for ANI to resurrect these dormant NDAs. It appears to be unprecedented.

So again, we haven't been particularly specific on price versus volume, but what we can say is that the majority of our growth is driven by volume. And certainly, as I mentioned earlier, this is what our strategy is all about. We've identified highly durable assets for underserved patient populations where the products currently have relatively low patient penetration. We invest in data. We invest in commercial resources. We invest in a variety of other arenas to drive that further patient penetration. So we actually believe that we're well positioned in the environment going forward, regardless of where pricing goes in the future. We think that the real winning strategy for the Mallinckrodt portfolio is primarily based on driving volume. And again, I think there's been some misunderstanding of our commercial model and our business model. That's why we've been really emphasizing the fact that we acquire and we invest and we look for opportunities to drive volume with highly durable assets. With regards to our business development strategy, again, we've been remarkably consistent, I think, since we spun in that we've looked for areas where there are underserved patient populations, unique assets that have a degree of complexity to them, where we have a certain capability, where we can take underserved patient populations with products with low patient penetration and drive volume. We think there's a lot of products out there. And as you can see, through our acquisition strategy, we've been very specific in the areas in which we chose to play. That's the hospital channel. We've now built about $1 billion hospital portfolio, well-diversified, unique assets that we think have a compelling volume and pharmacoeconomic proposition. We're in the autoimmune and rare disease space with an opportunity to build around specialties in rheumatology, pulmonology, nephrology and neurology. And we also like to highly specialize generic space. So we got 3 areas that we think are very attractive for the long term to continue to build out on acquisition strategy, build out the diversification of our portfolio and again focusing on durable assets. I want emphasize again our objective from the beginning is to have no single product be more than 1/3 of our operating income. And as you've heard Matt say in the prepared comments, we're getting very, very close to that objective. We can do that without any further business development, but we think there's a lot of assets here that fit our model, that are going to do very well in Mallinckrodt's hands, and we'll continue to be aggressive in seeking those."

I'm very pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered a strong first quarter and fiscal 2016, building on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter, and we're confident that our ongoing focus on execution will produce continued, steady progress throughout the remainder of the year. 
Net sales were up 20% for the quarter on an operational basis, with exceptional commercial execution driving continued, steady volume gains in the Specialty Brands portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was strong as well, as Cole mentioned, up nearly 17% for the quarter. This strong performance, particularly in key Specialty Brands products, clearly demonstrates both the effectiveness of our strategy to create near and long-term value for patients and shareholders and our ability to execute on our plans. Based on this, we also raised our adjusted EPS guidance range for the remainder of fiscal 2016, which Matt will cover in more detail later. 
We continue to move at a rapid pace on a number of strategic fronts and made great progress in the quarter. In December, we announced our plan to acquire 3 commercial-stage, global specialty hemostasis brands to further diversify our hospital growth platform. I'm happy to report we closed on this transaction yesterday and are already moving forward with the rapid integration of these assets. We plan to market RECOTHROM immediately through our OFIRMEV hospital-focused team and expect the U.S. launch of PreveLeak and RAPLIXA later in the second half of the year. Also, in December, we held an investor briefing to reinforce the diversity and durability of our growing portfolio and highlight the broad investments, primarily in the branded portfolio, that clearly demonstrate our strategy to grow the company both organically and inorganically long term. 
We hired top-tier industry veterans in key positions, which will be instrumental to our growth in 2016 and beyond. Ron Lloyd, with 30 years of experience, 15 of those in the hospital market, joined as President of our hospital business reporting to me. And Dr. Tunde Otulana has become our Chief Medical Officer, coming to us with broad experience as a senior pharmaceutical executive, pulmonologist and former FDA officer. Tunde will report to Steve Romano, our Chief Scientific Officer. 
We've continued to deliver on our Acquire to Invest business model, reporting data for more than 2 dozen presentations from both clinical and health economic studies, 2/3 of which was for Acthar to further define patient outcomes and strengthen and reinforce the value of our portfolio for the health care system. We finalized divestiture of the CMDS business, moving us another step forward in focusing the company on Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics. And last, but certainly not least, we executed on commercial priorities across our entire Specialty Brands segment to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth, enabling us to more than offset the ongoing market challenges we have in Specialty Generics. 
Simply stated, we know that the formula for continued success is to stick to our strategy of identifying and investing in under-resourced, highly durable assets, to expand patient access and accelerate volume growth and then maintain a laser focus on execution. And in the first quarter, we did just that. 
Now let's look at key products. Acthar delivered another solid quarter with net sales up nearly 8% in the period, well within our expected range of ongoing mid-single to low-double-digit growth. Quarterly performance was principally driven through volume growth in rheumatology and pulmonology, and we're also seeing a positive prescribing rebound in more mature Acthar indications, such as infantile spasms, where focused commercial execution is resulting in increased use in children with this devastating disease. 
And while it's still very early, we've seen strong physician interest in the lupus poster presented last fall at the American College of Rheumatology Conference. We expect that data to be published in the second half of this year, and when it is, believe that it will further reinforce Acthar's potential as a treatment for certain lupus patients with physicians and payers. Additionally, as you'll remember, a second open-label phase of this multisite trial have been ongoing, looking at both durability of patient response to Acthar and potential impact of Acthar treatment on reduction of steroid use in these patients. This phase of the study is now complete, and we're in the process of submitting it for potential presentation and publication later in the year. 
We continue to make good progress with regard to Acthar reimbursement. You'll remember that our long-term objective is to bring the majority of covered lives under contract. Today, Acthar commercial coverage stands at about 1/3 of the total eligible U.S. patient population under contract with key payers, and we continue to focus on expanding coverage with other major payers. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2016 and beyond, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to grow Acthar sales volume in key indications through focused activities like these. 
Now let me share a bit about INOMAX, our second-largest product. With integration fully complete, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter with net sales up 16% on a pro forma basis. This acceleration in historical growth rates reflects strong commercial execution and a focus on expanding our contracting model, which is beneficial to customers, and importantly, better ensures appropriate patients have ready access to INOMAX. 
Continuing with hospital products. In our first full quarter of ownership, we were also pleased with the performance of Therakos, and expects its historical high single-digit growth to continue near term as we more fully integrate the business into Mallinckrodt. Longer term, we see a number of strategic opportunities we can pursue to potentially accelerate that growth. 
Rounding out Specialty Brands. I'm happy to report that the first quarter saw continued volume recovery for OFIRMEV through strong execution by the commercial team and further penetration in key accounts. This makes us even more confident of the return to year-on-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016, driven by expanded OFIRMEV procedure penetration in existing accounts, coupled with new account gains and recapturing volume and formulary status in other key accounts. 
Now turning to science and technology. In the first quarter, we made significant incremental investments in our key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, all consistent with our acquire to invest model. The substantial R&D spend includes initiation of 3 new clinical trials and patient enrollment and others. 
Let me share a number of additional highlights for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the 44-week open-label extension of our Phase IV company-sponsored trial of Acthar and lupus is complete, and we're working towards presenting that research later this year. We're also pleased to note registration of an Acthar company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite, double-blind trial in a key note [ph] product syndrome condition called FSGS on clinicaltrials.gov. We expect to see first patient, first visit in this trial in the coming months. 
We have also just enrolled the first subject into our company-sponsored, Phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in acute graft-versus-host disease for THERAKOS Photopheresis. This study, if successful, is a part of our long-term label-expansion strategy in the U.S. 
Turning to drug development. We continue to have meaningful dialogue with the FDA on our special protocol assessment request for the pivotal Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter terlipressin trial, and plan to initiate the study later this year. 
On the business development front, we continue to actively identify opportunities to add commercial and developmental assets to our portfolio. Our key areas of focus remain in Specialty Brands, including hospital, autoimmune and rare diseases and Specialty Generics. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we'll continue using the time-proven industry methods we know will build value. Based on the traction we see in key areas, we're confident we'll reach our goals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, first quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong both strategically and financially, and Specialty Brands results, fueled by our acquire to invest volume-driven strategy were exceptionally robust.  Net sales from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were $915 million versus $768 million in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, representing operational growth of 20.3%. We continue to make significant progress on further diversifying our portfolio as evidenced by the transaction we just closed for the 3 hemostasis products. By the end of fiscal 2016, assuming our current business mix and expected growth rates, we believe we will be within a few hundred basis points of achieving our goal to have no single product represent more than 1/3 of our overall operating income. And importantly, we believe we'll reach this goal even if we do no other business development this year, and any additional product acquisitions we might make would only accelerate this time frame. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are raising our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $7.85 to $8.30. 
First quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $543 million, representing operational growth of 46%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and also in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX and Therakos. Acthar posted good results in the quarter with $287 million in net sales over the prior year quarterly revenue of $266 million, a 7.6% increase, and we continue to believe that the next several quarters will be at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range. 
We continue to focus on commercial execution, and are very pleased with steady volume increases and the overall performance of Acthar we've seen in the past few quarters, but in the context of our view for the full year, a few reminders may be in order. First, in every year, the first calendar quarter, our second fiscal quarter, is a challenging time to drive volume for Acthar as compared to other quarters due to benefit resets and seasonality. We expect the seasonality to continue in 2016 and anticipate this will impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our second quarter. And with the particularly strong performance of Acthar in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we also anticipate the third quarter of fiscal 2016 will be a tough comparison. Finally, the most significant impact of gross-to-net contracting pressure for Acthar is still ahead of us. Balancing all these factors, we believe we will likely remain at the low end of our long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar for the next several quarters. 
We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $111 million in net sales as compared to $96 million in the equivalent pro forma quarter last year, a 16% increase year-over-year. With this recent strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis. But based on historical performance, we continued to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to continue to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
For Therakos, while it's still early, we continue to anticipate high single-digit revenue growth in coming quarters and beyond. It is important to note that the Therakos platform has a larger international component than most other Mallinckrodt Specialty Brands comparators, and thus, results should be considered excluding foreign currency fluctuations. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, though revenue did not keep pace due to inventory adjustments. With this demand, as Mark mentioned, we are even more confident that we will achieve year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by the reclassification of Methylphenidate ER and increasing competition across a number of categories. Both factors were reflected in the first quarter with net sales of $258 million versus $284 million, representing an 8% year-over-year operational decline. Note that we're likely to see the toughest comparisons for Specialty Generics over the next couple of quarters, and year-over-year comparison should start to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The tough comparisons in Specialty Generics will also be putting pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales, which is likely to be lower than we saw this quarter. 
Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $104 million compared with $102 million in the prior year. Though we were pleased with the stronger-than-normal net sales in this segment for the quarter, these results were driven by onetime orders, and we expect to return to historical growth rates in the second quarter and beyond. Total company adjusted gross profit was $680 million, up from $559 million, with adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 74% compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. The strength of Acthar sales, in particular, contributed to these results. Yet, as I noted earlier, I'd caution that we're not likely to see that level of impact over the next couple of quarters when combined with the anticipated tough comparables from Specialty Generics. 
Total Mallinckrodt R&D spending in the quarter came in at 7% of net sales overall, with spending in our Specialty Brands segments significantly higher. Given our current trajectory, we expect fiscal 2016 Specialty Brands R&D spend as a percentage of net sales to approach double digits, given our focus on broad programs to generate clinical and health economic and outcomes research data across the portfolio. We've also made continued progress in reducing SG&A, investing strategically, while at the same time focusing on cost management. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved 100 basis points to 24.9% for the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $98 million compared to $49 million. While this number rose significantly, consistent with our 2016 guidance, we remain comfortable that our strong cash flow will easily accommodate multiple facets of our growth strategy. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17% compared to 20% in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated more than $0.25 billion in free cash flow. We use the strong cash generation and proceeds from the divestiture of CMDS to repurchase $275 million in stock, and also reduced total debt by just under $70 million. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $522 million. Our liquidity position remains quite strong and resilient, and we remain prepared to allocate capital towards additional share repurchases and potentially business development. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

With regards to Acthar sales, we're very pleased, obviously, with the quarter that we delivered here, consistent, I think, with the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that we're driving Acthar sales volume consistently across the board. The real focus, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, and the real growth drivers today are pulmonology and rheumatology, where we're seeing double-digit growth rates in both of those segments of the business. If we look at the mix of Acthar business, again, historically, it's been about 30% in each of neurology, nephrology and rheumatology, and that mix is still roughly the same. The remaining 10% being all other. But we are seeing again continued good strength in pulmonology as an emerging opportunity for Acthar. We're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing, particularly in areas like lupus and in rheum and also in RA, and we would expect, over the coming year that that's where you're going to see growth continuing to be driven in rheumatology and pulmonology, but we're also encouraged in certain areas of neurology, for example. I mentioned infantile spasms, where we've put additional refocus on that particular indication, and we're seeing a significant positive rebound in prescribing trends. Likewise, we see the same thing happening in nephrology that we're seeing a rebound in prescribing trends. And again, that's the result of significant commercial execution in those areas. We're also quite pleased with the fact that we continue to generate significant data in support of Acthar, and that's both clinical data, which we referenced. It's not just the lupus data, but it's a variety of other clinical mechanism of action and other studies that we're -- continue to invest in and publish, and also health economic data. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we had over 2 dozen publications in total, and about 2/3 of those publications were focused on Acthar. So we think it's this data generation. We think it's the commercial execution. And then of course, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in managed care with regards to access. We continue to make good progress in contracting and ensuring that the majority of Acthar covered lives over time will be under contract. So across the board, we're very pleased with Acthar growth."

It's possible it could happen sooner than that if these trends continue. With regards, though, to the revenue bid, it lags a little bit the volume growth simply because throughout the course of 2015, we did see some inventory adjustments in the channel, and that's not surprising given the fact that volume was a bit variable in 2015. Now that we think we've got a consistent volume trajectory, going forward, we believe we've got the right level of inventory in the channel."

That's one of the reasons why we raised the guidance range this morning. But I do think you bring up a great point that cannot be repeated often enough. The accounting reality of a 454 accounting convention, which we are on, is that once every 5.6 years, we do get a leap week that we will be experiencing in this year's fourth quarter. We've talked about that. That will tend to, everything else being equal, help our year-over-year comparisons this year. But by the same token, it's going to put some mathematical year-over-year comparison issues in 2017 in the fourth quarter, and it's important that everyone take that into account when you look at 2017. The only other thing I'd say is that we talked very specifically at our Investor Day to try to give everyone a long-term idea of where we're managing the business from a growth standpoint. We absolutely think that we can drive organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and that we can use organic and financial leverage to leverage the earnings number beyond that. Having said that, I can tell you there are a couple of people out there who don't seem to have heard that message. We've got a couple of people that have earnings growth in the high teens in 2017. I hope we're able to make that number. We're not going to talk about it at this point, but I think given the pressure of that extra week, that's something that I want everyone to take into account when you're accounting for 2017."

And again, very pleased with what we're seeing from a commercial execution standpoint. Very pleased with what we're seeing from a data generation standpoint and a market access standpoint. Let's keep in mind that we believe quite strongly that Acthar will continue to be in the range of mid-single to low double-digit growth. We believe that we're playing a long game here with a very durable asset, a highly durable asset, with currently low penetration. And we think the strategy that we're employing of investing in this asset, executing against the data that we're generating and being very strong in the work that we're doing with managed care is the right long-term strategy to ensure long-term access for Acthar, long-term growth for Acthar and benefit for patients."

I would argue that both on the Specialty Brands side as well as Specialty Generics that some of the price points paid have been relatively high when compared with historical frame. This being said, if you look at 2 of our acquisitions, in particular and the multiples we paid, that would be the Ikaria acquisition and the Acthar acquisition, in particular. Despite the competition, we were able to pay relatively low multiple premiums for those assets. So we've shown an affinity to go after assets that really fits strategically and may not be as competitive as some of the other assets that have been sold over time. As it relates to Specialty Generics, I'd say a couple of things. The first is there are a number of assets out there that are available. There are more specialty generic opportunities out there now than there have been over the last, say, 24, 36 months. Even though there has been some consolidation, we still see an array of opportunities there. The second is, is some of the players in the industry that are consolidating are highly levered, and that may slow them down from further consolidation. You may have seen on our website, we put a reconciliation out there of our net debt leverage, which is at 3.5 right now, and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had over $500 million as we came out of December. So we're in an enviable position, I would say, from a liquidity viewpoint, to pursue targets."

With regards to INOMAX, yes, we're exceptionally pleased with the performance of INOMAX. Clearly, with 16% growth in the first quarter, I think this is evidence of the fact that the commercial execution under Mallinckrodt's ownership is really starting to drive some benefits here. In terms of our contracting strategy, this is something that's really good for patients. It's really good for customers and it's good for the business. This is something that customers like because it gives them good predictability and visibility to their potential expenditure. It's obviously great for patients. Keep in mind that INOMAX today has about a 50% market share in the neonatal intensive care patient population that we treat, and it's a therapy that, compared to many of the alternatives, has significant benefits. So we think there's an opportunity to drive a lot more patient penetration here. And one of the barriers historically has been that for some of the less sick patients, physicians are faced with the choice of, ""Do they use INOMAX or do they use something else that may be less expensive but may have poorer outcomes?"" Now we contract in a way that enables accounts to really have unlimited usage so they don't -- it removes that decision about what type of patient can benefit from INOMAX. Any patient that can benefit from INOMAX now can have access to it with this contracting strategy. So again, we think it's great for us, great for the accounts and very, very good for patients, and you're seeing that impact now in the results here in the first quarter. Historically, this has been a business, as we've said, that's been in the mid-single-digit growth rate, and you've heard Matt's comments. With the performance that we're currently seeing, it's obvious that we'll be delivering at a growth rate this year significantly higher than that mid-single-digit growth rate. Longer term remains to be seen, but based on historical frame, you would expect that we will have a long-term growth rate for INOMAX in the mid-single-digit range. But clearly, in 2016, we're going to drive something significantly higher than that."

And a lot of that reinvestment, as Mark mentioned earlier, is going into Acthar. So that's putting a fair bit of pressure on the operating income for that particular product. This being said, we're also investing in Therakos, INOMAX, so there's a lot of reinvestment going on as well."

As it relates to the gross profit or gross margin, it was an exceptionally strong quarter without question. A lot of that had to do with the strength in the Specialty Brands business, which was able to mute the effect of the supply disruption we had in nuclear, as well as the pressure we see in Specialty Generics. This being said, take my comments to note from the prepared remarks, we hit a high water mark, at least, in the short term, for gross profit. We see significant pressure in the second and third quarter. In the second quarter, you've got 2 things really going on. We see genetics getting much more pressure than what we saw in the first quarter combined with Acthar seasonality and benefit resets. and then in the third quarter, we have a tough comp for Acthar. As you know, the third quarter last year was a real strong quarter for us, and then we also see significant pressure in generics. So while we were pleased with the results we saw in the first quarter, the pressure is in the future quarters. As it relates to SG&A, you're absolutely right. We have dropped pretty significantly over the last 2 to 3 years. Coming out of the gates, we were in the low-30s, as you know. So I was very happy to see that we came in at 25%. This being said, I'd -- the spend will tick up more than likely in the latter part of this year. That's because we're investing in the hemostasis products to launch those, and we're also reinvesting in Acthar and Specialty Brands. So I would say, while we're very pleased with the results, it was unusually low in the quarter, but I really like the zone that we're in right now."

Again, I think this goes back to the business model that we've been describing, which is our acquire to invest business model, and let's recognize that we've been very specific and deliberate about how we built our portfolio. We've looked for assets that serve underserved patient populations, typically, where our products currently have low-patient penetrations. So there's a long-term volume play here, and we also look for assets that have exceptional durability. So it makes good sense for us to invest in these assets and focus on driving volume growth, and that's been our strategy from the beginning, and that continues to be our strategy going forward. So whether it's 3% patient penetration rate for Acthar, whether it's 10% to 15% penetration in CTCL for Therakos, we think there's a significant opportunity for our products to drive growth by driving volume. In terms of market shares and those types of things, the long-term trajectory that we've given is consistent with what we've said a couple of times now, most recently, at our Investor Day, that our objective is to drive long-term revenue growth in the mid-single digits on an organic basis, and that we would drive EPS at a rate higher than that, and that's our objective. That's how we're focused. And the way we're going to go about doing that is through the acquire to invest strategy, driving volume in underserved patient populations with highly durable assets."

So yes, the story for INOMAX is, again, I think a very straightforward and simple one. We think there's tremendous opportunity to drive utilization in more patients that can benefit from INOMAX. And that's what our strategy, our contracting strategy is all about, is to make it more accessible and easier for accounts to use INOMAX in more patients that are eligible. That's to the benefit of the patients, and we think, at least, in the near term, the opportunity is through that opportunity to access more patients through our contracting. We believe that we have placements in the majority of the significant NICUs around the country. There may be some opportunities for us to drive additional volume and revenue with some indications, some label expansion indications we have in markets outside the U.S. For example, we got a CV indication in both Japan and Australia. Those are relatively smaller markets, but there's an opportunity for us to drive revenue there. But longer term, we think there may be an opportunity to further expand INOMAX usage by expanding the label, and potentially penetrating into lower-level NICUs. But the primary opportunity, we believe, over the long term, is to just make INOMAX more accessible to more patients, and to drive that current 50% patient penetration rate that we have today significantly higher."

So hydrocodone in our first quarter last year was relatively low when compared with future quarters. Part of that was some timing advent as the conversion took place in the marketplace from C3 to C2. So the comps are going to get particularly tough as we move forward because those were the quarters where we saw exceptional growth in hydrocodone. On oxycodone, really, what we're seeing here is a significant amount of competition, which we've been talking about now for a good 9, 10 months. And so you can see, while it's still generating good revenue around $30 million at a good margin, we certainly aren't seeing that pressure, and it's really volume."

So the share repurchases certainly are a very attractive vehicle to return value to shareholders right now. This being said, there are assets in the business development area that are of interest, and we are always -- and we'll continue to look, it's kind of an evergreen process here, to see what we can bring into the portfolio. As it relates to debt, you'll see this in the details that we file in the Q shortly. We repurchased $26 million of our debt on the open market. We paid down the revolver to the tune of about $100 million, but we also drew on our AR securitization program, and that led to roughly a $70 million decrease in debt. So those are the mechanics of it. The reason that was not specifically mentioned in the release is -- you're absolutely right.

And then with regards to our strategy regarding the durability of Acthar, we're looking at a whole variety of different approaches across the board of -- that range from manufacturing to intellectual property, the whole variety of other issues. This would be -- this is something that we will do regardless of whatever happens with the ANI situation."

So again, we haven't been particularly specific on price versus volume, but what we can say is that the majority of our growth is driven by volume. And certainly, as I mentioned earlier, this is what our strategy is all about. We've identified highly durable assets for underserved patient populations, where the products currently have relatively low patient penetration. We invest in data. We invest in commercial resources. We invest in a variety of other arenas to drive that further patient penetration. So we actually believe that we're well positioned in the environment going forward, regardless of where pricing goes in the future. We think the real winning strategy for the Mallinckrodt portfolio is primarily based on driving volume. And again, I think there's been some misunderstanding of our commercial model and our business model. That's why we've been really emphasizing the fact that we acquire and we invest and we look for opportunities to drive volume with highly durable assets. With regards to our business development strategy, again, we've been remarkably consistent, I think, since we spun in that we've looked for areas where there are underserved patient populations, unique assets that have a degree of complexity to them, where we have a certain capability, where we can take underserved patient populations with products with low patient penetration and drive volume. We think there's a lot of products out there. And as you can see, through our acquisition strategy, we've been very specific in the areas in which we chose to play. That's the hospital channel. We've now built about $1 billion hospital portfolio, well-diversified, unique assets that we think have a compelling volume and pharmacoeconomic proposition. We're in the autoimmune and rare disease space with an opportunity to build around specialties in rheumatology, pulmonology, nephrology and neurology, and we also like the highly specialized generic space. So we got 3 areas that we think are very attractive for the long term to continue to build out an acquisition strategy, build out the diversification of our portfolio, and again, focusing on durable assets. I want emphasize again our objective from the beginning is to have no single product be more than 1/3 of our operating income. And as you heard Matt say in the prepared comments, we're getting very, very close to that objective. We can do that without any further business development, but we think there's a lot of assets here that fit our model, that are going to do very well in Mallinckrodt's hands, and we'll continue to be aggressive in seeking those."

I'm very pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered a strong first quarter and fiscal 2016, building on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter, and we're confident that our ongoing focus on execution will produce continued, steady progress throughout the remainder of the year. 
Net sales were up 20% for the quarter on an operational basis, with exceptional commercial execution driving continued, steady volume gains in the Specialty Brands portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was strong as well, as Cole mentioned, up nearly 17% for the quarter. This strong performance, particularly in key Specialty Brands products, clearly demonstrates both the effectiveness of our strategy to create near and long-term value for patients and shareholders and our ability to execute on our plans. Based on this, we also raised our adjusted EPS guidance range for the remainder of fiscal 2016, which Matt will cover in more detail later. 
We continue to move at a rapid pace on a number of strategic fronts and made great progress in the quarter. In December, we announced our plan to acquire 3 commercial-stage, global specialty hemostasis brands to further diversify our hospital growth platform. I'm happy to report we closed on this transaction yesterday and are already moving forward with the rapid integration of these assets. We plan to market RECOTHROM immediately through our OFIRMEV hospital-focused team and expect the U.S. launch of PreveLeak and RAPLIXA later in the second half of the year. Also, in December, we held an investor briefing to reinforce the diversity and durability of our growing portfolio and highlight the broad investments, primarily in the branded portfolio, that clearly demonstrate our strategy to grow the company both organically and inorganically long term. 
We hired top-tier industry veterans in key positions, which will be instrumental to our growth in 2016 and beyond. Ron Lloyd, with 30 years of experience, 15 of those in the hospital market, joined as President of our hospital business reporting to me. And Dr. Tunde Otulana has become our Chief Medical Officer, coming to us with broad experience as a senior pharmaceutical executive, pulmonologist and former FDA officer. Tunde will report to Steve Romano, our Chief Scientific Officer. 
We've continued to deliver on our Acquire to Invest business model, reporting data for more than 2 dozen presentations from both clinical and health economic studies, 2/3 of which was for Acthar to further define patient outcomes and strengthen and reinforce the value of our portfolio for the health care system. We finalized divestiture of the CMDS business, moving us another step forward in focusing the company on Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics. And last, but certainly not least, we executed on commercial priorities across our entire Specialty Brands segment to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth, enabling us to more than offset the ongoing market challenges we have in Specialty Generics. 
Simply stated, we know that the formula for continued success is to stick to our strategy of identifying and investing in under-resourced, highly durable assets, to expand patient access and accelerate volume growth and then maintain a laser focus on execution. And in the first quarter, we did just that. 
Now let's look at key products. Acthar delivered another solid quarter with net sales up nearly 8% in the period, well within our expected range of ongoing mid-single to low-double-digit growth. Quarterly performance was principally driven through volume growth in rheumatology and pulmonology, and we're also seeing a positive prescribing rebound in more mature Acthar indications, such as infantile spasms, where focused commercial execution is resulting in increased use in children with this devastating disease. 
And while it's still very early, we've seen strong physician interest in the lupus poster presented last fall at the American College of Rheumatology Conference. We expect that data to be published in the second half of this year, and when it is, believe that it will further reinforce Acthar's potential as a treatment for certain lupus patients with physicians and payers. Additionally, as you'll remember, a second open-label phase of this multisite trial have been ongoing, looking at both durability of patient response to Acthar and potential impact of Acthar treatment on reduction of steroid use in these patients. This phase of the study is now complete, and we're in the process of submitting it for potential presentation and publication later in the year. 
We continue to make good progress with regard to Acthar reimbursement. You'll remember that our long-term objective is to bring the majority of covered lives under contract. Today, Acthar commercial coverage stands at about 1/3 of the total eligible U.S. patient population under contract with key payers, and we continue to focus on expanding coverage with other major payers. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2016 and beyond, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to grow Acthar sales volume in key indications through focused activities like these. 
Now let me share a bit about INOMAX, our second-largest product. With integration fully complete, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter with net sales up 16% on a pro forma basis. This acceleration in historical growth rates reflects strong commercial execution and a focus on expanding our contracting model, which is beneficial to customers, and importantly, better ensures appropriate patients have ready access to INOMAX. 
Continuing with hospital products. In our first full quarter of ownership, we were also pleased with the performance of Therakos, and expects its historical high single-digit growth to continue near term as we more fully integrate the business into Mallinckrodt. Longer term, we see a number of strategic opportunities we can pursue to potentially accelerate that growth. 
Rounding out Specialty Brands. I'm happy to report that the first quarter saw continued volume recovery for OFIRMEV through strong execution by the commercial team and further penetration in key accounts. This makes us even more confident of the return to year-on-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016, driven by expanded OFIRMEV procedure penetration in existing accounts, coupled with new account gains and recapturing volume and formulary status in other key accounts. 
Now turning to science and technology. In the first quarter, we made significant incremental investments in our key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, all consistent with our acquire to invest model. The substantial R&D spend includes initiation of 3 new clinical trials and patient enrollment in others. 
Let me share a number of additional highlights for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the 44-week open-label extension of our Phase IV company-sponsored trial of Acthar and lupus is complete, and we're working towards presenting that research later this year. We're also pleased to note registration of an Acthar company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite, double-blind trial in a key note [ph] product syndrome condition called FSGS on clinicaltrials.gov. We expect to see first patient, first visit in this trial in the coming months. 
We have also just enrolled the first subject into our company-sponsored, Phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in acute graft-versus-host disease for THERAKOS Photopheresis. This study, if successful, is a part of our long-term label-expansion strategy in the U.S. 
Turning to drug development. We continue to have meaningful dialogue with the FDA on our special protocol assessment request for the pivotal Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter terlipressin trial, and plan to initiate the study later this year. 
On the business development front, we continue to actively identify opportunities to add commercial and developmental assets to our portfolio. Our key areas of focus remain in Specialty Brands, including hospital, autoimmune and rare diseases and Specialty Generics. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we'll continue using the time-proven industry methods we know will build value. Based on the traction we see in key areas, we're confident we'll reach our goals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, first quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong both strategically and financially, and Specialty Brands results, fueled by our acquire to invest volume-driven strategy were exceptionally robust.  Net sales from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were $915 million versus $768 million in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, representing operational growth of 20.3%. We continue to make significant progress on further diversifying our portfolio as evidenced by the transaction we just closed for the 3 hemostasis products. By the end of fiscal 2016, assuming our current business mix and expected growth rates, we believe we will be within a few hundred basis points of achieving our goal to have no single product represent more than 1/3 of our overall operating income. And importantly, we believe we'll reach this goal even if we do no other business development this year, and any additional product acquisitions we might make would only accelerate this time frame. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are raising our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $7.85 to $8.30. 
First quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $543 million, representing operational growth of 46%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and also in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX and Therakos. Acthar posted good results in the quarter with $287 million in net sales over the prior year quarterly revenue of $266 million, a 7.6% increase, and we continue to believe that the next several quarters will be at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range. 
We continue to focus on commercial execution, and are very pleased with steady volume increases and the overall performance of Acthar we've seen in the past few quarters, but in the context of our view for the full year, a few reminders may be in order. First, in every year, the first calendar quarter, our second fiscal quarter, is a challenging time to drive volume for Acthar as compared to other quarters due to benefit resets and seasonality. We expect the seasonality to continue in 2016 and anticipate this will impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our second quarter. And with the particularly strong performance of Acthar in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we also anticipate the third quarter of fiscal 2016 will be a tough comparison. Finally, the most significant impact of gross-to-net contracting pressure for Acthar is still ahead of us. Balancing all these factors, we believe we will likely remain at the low end of our long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar for the next several quarters. 
We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $111 million in net sales as compared to $96 million in the equivalent pro forma quarter last year, a 16% increase year-over-year. With this recent strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis. But based on historical performance, we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to continue to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
For Therakos, while it's still early, we continue to anticipate high single-digit revenue growth in coming quarters and beyond. It is important to note that the Therakos platform has a larger international component than most other Mallinckrodt Specialty Brands comparators, and thus, results should be considered excluding foreign currency fluctuations. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, though revenue did not keep pace due to inventory adjustments. With this demand, as Mark mentioned, we are even more confident that we will achieve year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2016. 
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by the reclassification of Methylphenidate ER and increasing competition across a number of categories. Both factors were reflected in the first quarter with net sales of $258 million versus $284 million, representing an 8% year-over-year operational decline. Note that we're likely to see the toughest comparisons for Specialty Generics over the next couple of quarters, and year-over-year comparison should start to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The tough comparisons in Specialty Generics will also be putting pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales, which is likely to be lower than we saw this quarter. 
Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $104 million compared with $102 million in the prior year. Though we were pleased with the stronger-than-normal net sales in this segment for the quarter, these results were driven by onetime orders, and we expect to return to historical growth rates in the second quarter and beyond. Total company adjusted gross profit was $680 million, up from $559 million, with adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 74% compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. The strength of Acthar sales, in particular, contributed to these results. Yet, as I noted earlier, I'd caution that we're not likely to see that level of impact over the next couple of quarters when combined with the anticipated tough comparables from Specialty Generics. 
Total Mallinckrodt R&D spending in the quarter came in at 7% of net sales overall, with spending in our Specialty Brands segments significantly higher. Given our current trajectory, we expect fiscal 2016 Specialty Brands R&D spend as a percentage of net sales to approach double digits, given our focus on broad programs to generate clinical and health economic and outcomes research data across the portfolio. We've also made continued progress in reducing SG&A, investing strategically, while at the same time focusing on cost management. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved 100 basis points to 24.9% for the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $98 million compared to $49 million. While this number rose significantly, consistent with our 2016 guidance, we remain comfortable that our strong cash flow will easily accommodate multiple facets of our growth strategy. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17% compared to 20% in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated more than $0.25 billion in free cash flow. We use the strong cash generation and proceeds from the divestiture of CMDS to repurchase $275 million in stock, and also reduced total debt by just under $70 million. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $522 million. Our liquidity position remains quite strong and resilient, and we remain prepared to allocate capital towards additional share repurchases and potentially business development. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

With regards to Acthar sales, we're very pleased, obviously, with the quarter that we delivered here, consistent, I think, with the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that we're driving Acthar sales volume consistently across the board. The real focus, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, and the real growth drivers today are pulmonology and rheumatology, where we're seeing double-digit growth rates in both of those segments of the business. If we look at the mix of Acthar business, again, historically, it's been about 30% in each of neurology, nephrology and rheumatology, and that mix is still roughly the same. The remaining 10% being all other. But we are seeing again continued good strength in pulmonology as an emerging opportunity for Acthar. We're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing, particularly in areas like lupus and in rheum and also in RA, and we would expect, over the coming year that that's where you're going to see growth continuing to be driven in rheumatology and pulmonology, but we're also encouraged in certain areas of neurology, for example. I mentioned infantile spasms, where we've put additional refocus on that particular indication, and we're seeing a significant positive rebound in prescribing trends. Likewise, we see the same thing happening in nephrology that we're seeing a rebound in prescribing trends. And again, that's the result of significant commercial execution in those areas. We're also quite pleased with the fact that we continue to generate significant data in support of Acthar, and that's both clinical data, which we referenced. It's not just the lupus data, but it's a variety of other clinical mechanism of action and other studies that we're -- continue to invest in and publish, and also health economic data. As I mentioned, in the quarter, we had over 2 dozen publications in total, and about 2/3 of those publications were focused on Acthar. So we think it's this data generation. We think it's the commercial execution. And then of course, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in managed care with regards to access. We continue to make good progress in contracting and ensuring that the majority of Acthar covered lives over time will be under contract. So across the board, we're very pleased with Acthar growth."

With regards, though, to the revenue bid, it lags a little bit, the volume growth, simply because throughout the course of 2015, we did see some inventory adjustments in the channel, and that's not surprising given the fact that volume was a bit variable in 2015. Now that we think we've got a consistent volume trajectory, going forward, we believe we've got the right level of inventory in the channel."

At some point in the future, we'll give more details on 2017. And let me add, although it's only the results in the first quarter, we're darn pleased with where we're looking for 2016. That's one of the reasons why we raised the guidance range this morning. But I do think you bring up a great point that cannot be repeated often enough. The accounting reality of a 454 accounting convention, which we are on, is that once every 5.6 years, we do get a leap week that we will be experiencing in this year's fourth quarter. We've talked about that. That will tend to, everything else being equal, help our year-over-year comparisons this year. But by the same token, it's going to put some mathematical year-over-year comparison issues in 2017 in the fourth quarter, and it's important that everyone take that into account when you look at 2017. The only other thing I'd say is that we talked very specifically at our Investor Day to try to give everyone a long-term idea of where we're managing the business from a growth standpoint. We absolutely think that we can drive organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and that we can use organic and financial leverage to leverage the earnings number beyond that. Having said that, I can tell you there are a couple of people out there who don't seem to have heard that message. We've got a couple of people that have earnings growth in the high teens in 2017. I hope we're able to make that number. We're not going to talk about it at this point, but I think given the pressure of that extra week, that's something that I want everyone to take into account when you're accounting for 2017."

And again, very pleased with what we're seeing from a commercial execution standpoint. Very pleased with what we're seeing from a data generation standpoint and a market access standpoint. Let's keep in mind that we believe quite strongly that Acthar will continue to be in the range of mid-single to low double-digit growth. We believe that we're playing a long game here with a very durable asset, a highly durable asset, with currently low penetration. And we think the strategy that we're employing of investing in this asset, executing against the data that we're generating and being very strong in the work that we're doing with managed care is the right long-term strategy to ensure long-term access for Acthar, long-term growth for Acthar and benefit for patients."

I would argue that both on the Specialty Brands side as well as Specialty Generics that some of the price points paid have been relatively high when compared with historical frame. This being said, if you look at 2 of our acquisitions, in particular and the multiples we paid, that would be the Ikaria acquisition and the Acthar acquisition, in particular. Despite the competition, we were able to pay relatively low multiple premiums for those assets. So we've shown an affinity to go after assets that really fits strategically and may not be as competitive as some of the other assets that have been sold over time. As it relates to Specialty Generics, I'd say a couple of things. The first is there are a number of assets out there that are available. There are more specialty generic opportunities out there now than there have been over the last, say, 24, 36 months. Even though there has been some consolidation, we still see an array of opportunities there. The second is, is some of the players in the industry that are consolidating are highly levered, and that may slow them down from further consolidation. You may have seen on our website, we put a reconciliation out there of our net debt leverage, which is at 3.5 right now, and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had over $500 million as we came out of December. So we're in an enviable position, I would say, from a liquidity viewpoint, to pursue targets."

With regards to INOMAX, yes, we're exceptionally pleased with the performance of INOMAX. Clearly, with 16% growth in the first quarter, I think this is evidence of the fact that the commercial execution under Mallinckrodt's ownership is really starting to drive some benefits here. In terms of our contracting strategy, this is something that's really good for patients. It's really good for customers and it's good for the business. This is something that customers like because it gives them good predictability and visibility to their potential expenditure. It's obviously great for patients. Keep in mind that INOMAX today has about a 50% market share in the neonatal intensive care patient population that we treat, and it's a therapy that, compared to many of the alternatives, has significant benefits. So we think there's an opportunity to drive a lot more patient penetration here. And one of the barriers historically has been that for some of the less sick patients, physicians are faced with the choice of, ""Do they use INOMAX or do they use something else that may be less expensive but may have poorer outcomes?"" Now we contract in a way that enables accounts to really have unlimited usage so they don't -- it removes that decision about what type of patient can benefit from INOMAX. Any patient that can benefit from INOMAX now can have access to it with this contracting strategy. So again, we think it's great for us, great for the accounts and very, very good for patients, and you're seeing that impact now in the results here in the first quarter. Historically, this has been a business, as we've said, that's been in the mid-single-digit growth rate, and you've heard Matt's comments. With the performance that we're currently seeing, it's obvious that we'll be delivering at a growth rate this year significantly higher than that mid-single-digit growth rate. Longer term remains to be seen, but based on historical frame, you would expect that we will have a long-term growth rate for INOMAX in the mid-single-digit range. But clearly, in 2016, we're going to drive something significantly higher than that."

A lot of that had to do with the strength in the Specialty Brands business, which was able to mute the effect of the supply disruption we had in nuclear, as well as the pressure we see in Specialty Generics. This being said, take my comments to note from the prepared remarks, we hit a high watermark, at least, in the short term, for gross profit. We see significant pressure in the second and third quarter. In the second quarter, you've got 2 things really going on. We see generics getting much more pressure than what we saw in the first quarter combined with Acthar seasonality and benefit resets. and then in the third quarter, we have a tough comp for Acthar. As you know, the third quarter last year was a real strong quarter for us, and then we also see significant pressure in generics. So while we were pleased with the results we saw in the first quarter, the pressure is in the future quarters. As it relates to SG&A, you're absolutely right. We have dropped pretty significantly over the last 2 to 3 years. Coming out of the gates, we were in the low-30s, as you know. So I was very happy to see that we came in at 25%. This being said, I'd -- the spend will tick up more than likely in the latter part of this year. That's because we're investing in the hemostasis products to launch those, and we're also reinvesting in Acthar and Specialty Brands. So I would say, while we're very pleased with the results, it was unusually low in the quarter, but I really like the zone that we're in right now."

Again, I think this goes back to the business model that we've been describing, which is our acquire to invest business model, and let's recognize that we've been very specific and deliberate about how we built our portfolio. We've looked for assets that serve underserved patient populations, typically, where our products currently have low-patient penetrations. So there's a long-term volume play here, and we've also looked for assets that have exceptional durability. So it makes good sense for us to invest in these assets and focus on driving volume growth, and that's been our strategy from the beginning, and that continues to be our strategy going forward. So whether it's 3% patient penetration rate for Acthar, whether it's 10% to 15% penetration in CTCL for Therakos, we think there's a significant opportunity for our products to drive growth by driving volume. In terms of market shares and those types of things, the long-term trajectory that we've given is consistent with what we've said a couple of times now, most recently, at our Investor Day, that our objective is to drive long-term revenue growth in the mid-single digits on an organic basis, and that we would drive EPS at a rate higher than that, and that's our objective.

That's to the benefit of the patients, and we think, at least, in the near term, the opportunity is through that opportunity to access more patients through our contracting. We believe that we have placements in the majority of the significant NICUs around the country. There may be some opportunities for us to drive additional volume and revenue with some indications, some label expansion indications we have in markets outside the U.S. For example, we got a CV indication in both Japan and Australia. Those are relatively smaller markets, but there's an opportunity for us to drive revenue there. But longer term, we think there may be an opportunity to further expand INOMAX usage by expanding the label, and potentially penetrating into lower-level NICUs. But the primary opportunity, we believe, over the long term, is to just make INOMAX more accessible to more patients, and to drive that current 50% patient penetration rate that we have today significantly higher."

On oxycodone, really, what we're seeing here is a significant amount of competition, which we've been talking about now for a good 9, 10 months.

So just to remind everyone, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $75 million, and that was a little under 1 million shares that we repurchased. And then we repurchased $275 million, about 3.9 million shares in the first quarter. And so we've been pretty aggressive. A lot of that had to do with the fact that we had a lot of cash flow that we were generating from the underlying business in addition to the proceeds from the divestiture of CMDS. So the share repurchases certainly are a very attractive vehicle to return value to shareholders right now. This being said, there are assets in the business development area that are of interest, and we are always -- and we'll continue to look, it's kind of an evergreen process here, to see what we can bring into the portfolio. As it relates to debt, you'll see this in the details that we file in the Q shortly. We repurchased $26 million of our debt on the open market. We paid down the revolver to the tune of about $100 million, but we also drew on our AR securitization program, and that led to roughly a $70 million decrease in debt. So those are the mechanics of it. The reason debt was not specifically mentioned in the release is -- you're absolutely right. Right now, the spreads are tight, and so from a value perspective, we can drive more value focusing on the other 2 levers. But if the credit spreads were to open up again and widen, we would certainly contemplate focusing on debt again."

So again, we haven't been particularly specific on price versus volume, but what we can say is that the majority of our growth is driven by volume. And certainly, as I mentioned earlier, this is what our strategy is all about. We've identified highly durable assets for underserved patient populations, where the products currently have relatively low patient penetration. We invest in data. We invest in commercial resources. We invest in a variety of other arenas to drive that further patient penetration. So we actually believe that we're well positioned in the environment going forward, regardless of where pricing goes in the future. We think the real winning strategy for the Mallinckrodt portfolio is primarily based on driving volume. And again, I think there's been some misunderstanding of our commercial model and our business model. That's why we've been really emphasizing the fact that we acquire and we invest and we look for opportunities to drive volume with highly durable assets. With regards to our business development strategy, again, we've been remarkably consistent, I think, since we spun in that we've looked for areas where there are underserved patient populations, unique assets that have a degree of complexity to them, where we have a certain capability, where we can take underserved patient populations with products with low patient penetration and drive volume. We think there's a lot of products out there. And as you can see, through our acquisition strategy, we've been very specific in the areas in which we chose to play. That's the hospital channel. We've now built about $1 billion hospital portfolio, well-diversified, unique assets that we think have a compelling volume and pharmacoeconomic proposition. We're in the autoimmune and rare disease space with an opportunity to build around specialties in rheumatology, pulmonology, nephrology and neurology, and we also like the highly specialized generic space. So we got 3 areas that we think are very attractive for the long term to continue to build out an acquisition strategy, build out the diversification of our portfolio, and again, focusing on durable assets. I want emphasize again our objective from the beginning is to have no single product be more than 1/3 of our operating income. And as you heard Matt say in the prepared comments, we're getting very, very close to that objective. We can do that without any further business development, but we think there's a lot of assets here that fit our model, that are going to do very well in Mallinckrodt's hands, and we'll continue to be aggressive in seeking those."

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our exp",1421,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our expectations both for this quarter and for the first half of fiscal 2016. We remain focused on company-wide execution, giving us confidence that we'll continue to make steady gains throughout the balance of the year. 
As Matt will cover in more detail later, we've raised our adjusted EPS guidance range today for the second time since giving initial guidance back in October. 
Net sales grew up nearly 13% in the second quarter, driven by robust financial performance in Specialty Brands, where we continue to see steady volume gains across the portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was notable as well, as Cole mentioned, up more than 18% for the quarter. This strong showing clearly demonstrates we are executing against our strategy to drive volume-based growth and create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders. 
Our accelerated pace on a number of strategic fronts was reflected in the progress we made in the quarter. Let me share just a couple of key highlights with you. We've continued to generate new clinical and health economic data, building on the growing body of evidence for our products. In the quarter, we had approximately 10 data presentations and publications, the majority of which were for Acthar and OFIRMEV, bringing the overall total of publications to roughly 40 in the first half of the year. And importantly, as I mentioned, we continue to execute against the key commercial levers we've identified to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth across the Specialty Brands segment. This enabled us to more than offset the ongoing challenges we faced in the Specialty Generics segment. We expect continued pressure in that business for the foreseeable future, consistent with previous guidance. 
Let me step back a moment to put our Specialty Brands performance into perspective. Growing volumes across the segment equate to expanded patient access to powerful, potentially life-changing therapies. Here are just a few examples. More surgical patients may benefit from receiving OFIRMEV as part of a multimodal approach to surgical pain management, potentially reducing their hospital stay and complications and thereby reducing health care system costs. We can reach more infants suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure who can benefit from INOMAX therapy. More lupus patients experiencing exacerbation of their disease can potentially achieve relief through Acthar treatment. Increased numbers of infants suffering from infantile spasms are able to receive Acthar therapy to treat their devastating symptoms. And we're enabling more patients suffering from skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to harness the power of their own immune systems to fight this condition through Therakos immunotherapy. These examples illustrate why we believe so strongly in our established, acquire-to-invest strategy, identifying under-resourced, highly durable assets with significant volume growth potential and investing in them to expand access to underserved patient populations. Our formula for continued growth is working well. And looking ahead, we remain focused on sustaining this performance. 
Now let's look at key products in Specialty Brands. Focus on commercial execution across all therapeutic categories delivered another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up nearly 9% in the period propelled predominantly by steady volume growth. Pulmonology and rheumatology, where we believe we're beginning to see positive prescriber response to our recently published lupus data, continued to demonstrate strong growth. We have also began to see a steady uptick in growth and market share for infantile spasms, where we're concentrating on further expanding access in this population of fragile patients. 
We're also very pleased that with our ongoing focus on expanding access to Acthar, we've continued to sign new payer agreements. At this point, we've reached our initial goal to have greater than 50% of covered commercialize under contract a bit earlier than expected. Market access for Acthar will remain an area of high focus for us. 
Now let me give you some color on INOMAX, our second-largest product. Once again, the business delivered another strong quarter with net sales up 14% on a pro forma basis as we continue to successfully execute on our contracting strategy. This business has now exceeded historical growth rates in each of the 3 full quarters we've owned the asset, driven by strong commercial execution as appropriate patients have greater access to INOMAX. Longer term, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates with growth closer to historical norms in the back half of the year. 
Still focused on hospital products, in our second full quarter of ownership, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Therakos platform with net sales growth of 13% on a pro forma basis on a constant-currency basis. While we're pleased with the strong initial performance, we expect to see growth going forward to be in the historical high single-digit range. 
Moving into the surgical space. I'm happy to report that we were able to achieve 4% revenue growth for OFIRMEV, a return to year-on-year growth earlier than we had expected. These results were principally driven by volume growth through strong execution by the commercial team. We remain confident this upward trajectory will continue in the second half of fiscal 2016, bolstered by recent presentations of additional health economic data and growing acceptance of the benefits that multimodal analgesia brings to patients in the health care system. 
Closing out Specialty Brands. We were pleased that our latest acquisitions in the hemostasis space also performed well, although it's still very early. We're investing in the commercialization of all of these products, leveraging our OFIRMEV sales organization to promote RECOTHROM in addition to the contracting model traditionally employed. As noted previously, we expect to launch PreveLeak and RAPLIXA late in the back half of this fiscal year. 
Turning to Specialty Generics. We continue to value the cash flow generated by this business and the benefits it provides to patients. But the business continues to face significant competitive headwinds that we've been anticipating for some time, with net sales down 27% for the quarter. Though this downward trajectory may level off slightly in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the challenges in this business will likely continue to be compounded by the impact of downstream consolidation of pharmacy providers and heightened competition. 
Touching on science and technology or S&T. We continue to invest in programs to support key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands. Among these investments, we expect the first patient to be enrolled in the coming weeks in our company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multisite, double-blind trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome condition called FSGS. We also continued to evaluate opportunities to conduct Acthar Phase IV controlled trials in other key disease areas and will update you when these decisions are made. Simultaneously, we continue to generate additional data sets for Acthar, including preclinical and clinical data, patient registries and health economic assessments as well as sponsoring investigator-initiated trials. 
Here are some key S&T highlights for other areas in the portfolio for the quarter. We engaged in productive discussions with the FDA regarding final comments on our special protocol assessment submission for the terlipressin registration trial, and I'm pleased to report we recently received approval for the Phase III protocol. We plan to start the trial later this fiscal year. 
We also saw continued progress in several OFIRMEV Phase IV clinical trials, with data expected on a portion of these later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're pursuing a robust program to develop health economic data for OFIRMEV, with a number of recent presentations highlighted in press releases that can be found on our website. 
Finally, our company-sponsored, Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing. 
On the business development front, our key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms of hospital and Autoimmune and Rare Diseases as well as Specialty Generics. We're actively assessing a robust set of highly attractive opportunities and expect to continue adding developmental and commercial assets to our portfolio in the coming quarters. 
As we look ahead to the second half of 2016, the message is simple. By continuing to execute on the time-proven, strategic methods that we know bring value to patients and shareholders, we're confident we'll reach our goals. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt?"
232036063,328901665,970394,"Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Mallinckrodt PLC","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, second quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, and Specialty Brands results fueled by our volume growth strategy were exceptionally robust. Net sales from contin",758,"Thanks, Mark. Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, second quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, and Specialty Brands results fueled by our volume growth strategy were exceptionally robust. Net sales from continuing operations were $918 million, representing growth of 13%. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are increasing our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $8.15 to $8.50. This raises the low end of the range by $0.30 per share and the upper end by $0.20. 
Second quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $535 million, representing growth of 60%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX, Therakos and the recent addition of RECOTHROM. Acthar outperformed our lower longer-range expectations in the quarter with $248 million in net sales, a 9% increase. As we've said, we continue to believe that this franchise will grow at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range for at least the next several quarters. We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $116 million in net sales, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. With this continued strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis, but we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $50 million, a 13% [ph] increase on a pro forma basis. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter with revenue growth of 4%. As Mark noted, we're pleased to have the hemostasis portfolio integrated into our hospital business, and we continue to stand by our long-term estimate of low double-digit growth driven substantially by the product launches late this fiscal year. 
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw the toughest comparisons yet in the second quarter with net sales of $264 million, representing a 27% decline over prior year and anticipate similar results next quarter. While we expect comparisons to ease somewhat in the fourth quarter, we believe we're likely to see continued tough competitive market dynamics into fiscal 2017. 
Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $102 million or 5% decline. This reflects the anticipated return to historical performance indicated on our first quarter earnings call. 
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined as anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics drove these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. 
While absolute R&D spending in the quarter was up slightly over prior year, this came in below our expectations. We're focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the second half of fiscal 2016 and beyond. R&D for the quarter came in at 6.4% of net sales overall with investment in our Specialty Brands segment higher. 
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined as we continued to achieve savings from restructuring. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect some additive SG&A expense related to normal business activities as well as launch costs around our 2 new hemostasis products, PreveLeak and RAPLIXA. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.7% compared to 20.2%. We expect some upward pressure on this percentage in the second half of the fiscal year due primarily to business mix. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow $186 million. We also repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock in the quarter, returning 225 million of cash to shareholders. Overall liquidity and leverage remain very manageable. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $341 million despite the outlays for the hemostasis acquisition and the aggressive share repurchases. Our net debt leverage ratio was a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. We continue to focus on free cash flow, combining excellent cash conversion from earnings with a vigilant eye on working capital management, and we expect our strong free cash flow to continue throughout 2016 and beyond. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

First, let me say that we're very pleased with the Acthar performance that we've seen in the first half of the year and certainly in this quarter. It's performed a bit stronger than we expected. In terms of the go-forward growth rate, again, we believe that this product will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range, kind of in the lower end for the next couple of quarters. And the rationale for that is pretty straightforward. I mean we were very pleased to announce today that we've continued to sign payer contracts to procure and secure longer-term access for Acthar within the managed care environment. Clearly, that has downward pressure on pricing for us. And again, while we feel very comfortable that Acthar will continue to grow on that mid-single to low double-digit range because of this dynamic, we would expect it will be towards the lower end of that range near term. We do expect longer term for the growth rate to accelerate over time. Now we're very pleased that we've achieved our initial goal of having the majority of commercial lives under contract now for Acthar, but we're not done.

Look, when we look at our overall portfolio, we are very pleased that we have a diversified portfolio. If you keep in mind, we have 3 platforms now, each of which are roughly $1 billion or more in revenue. And we like that diversification. The generics business for us specifically is a bit over $1 billion in annualized revenue. It generates great cash flow for us and clearly provides a lot of benefits to patients for the generic products that we supply in the markets in which we compete. There's no doubt that this is a challenging and very competitive market at the moment. The dynamics are such where we're seeing a lot more competition. We just saw some statistics recently where the rate of ANDA approvals through the FDA is accelerating, so there's certainly been more competition in our space and across the generics space. We're also seeing some consolidation. Certainly, on the customer side of things, which are driving prices down. And again, I think we're seeing some of our competitors in the space deliver some challenging results in the last couple of quarters. However, at the end of the day, this is a tremendous cash flow generating business for us, and we use that cash flow very effectively to build out our portfolio. We build out our portfolio in Specialty Brands by harvesting and leveraging the cash that's generated from generics. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to acquire assets to further diversify our portfolio. Longer term, the generics business, for us, is one that we want to have as a steady growth business. And so therefore, it may make sense for us to consider looking at alternatives to build out that business as well, and that's likely to come through acquisition. That will largely be augmenting our portfolio of both commercial products as well as developmental opportunities."

And while we will continue to develop new ANDAs for controlled substances, we're going to have a longer-term, more sustainable, potentially growth business. We're going to need to branch out a bit more into few other niches. And again, as Matt described, we're going to focus on those with lower competitive intensity."

It's been a bit stronger than we anticipated. And it's for a couple of reasons, I think. One is that the pulmonology business continues to grow substantially. And again, I think that's on the basis of much like many of the other indications that Acthar has, as we improve, enhance and modernize the data set, which we've been very aggressive in doing, that information then enables us to demonstrate the value of Acthar and the benefit that Acthar can bring to patients. And that's been very true in the pulmonology space where there's been an emerging body of evidence to come out here in recent months around Acthar's use in sarcoidosis, where there are very few alternatives for patients. We've also seen a continued strength across the rheumatology portfolio, but clearly, the lupus data is starting to gain some traction with many physicians. And again, we will be reporting on the open-label extension on the lupus trial that we reported on a little bit earlier. That open-label extension, we expect, will be able to report out that data towards the second half of this year. But again, we continue to invest in a variety of different data sets for Acthar, and those are the types of pieces of evidence that are helping us have appropriate conversations with physicians and with payers about the appropriate physician for Acthar across the portfolio. But we've also seen certainly a bit of a resurgence in the use of Acthar for infantile spasms. We've refocused some of our activities into child neurology. Keep in mind, Acthar has very, very strong data for the -- for use in infantile spasms. Again, this is a tremendously devastating disease for patients. And so we've seen now a steady uptick in the growth and market share for infantile spasms as a result of our reemphasis on that particular specialty and that particular indication."

We factored in a number of things as we were thinking about the guidance we provided in October. And I would say, from a volume perspective, the market, fortuitously for us, is probably pretty close to playing out as we expected it to. This being said, I think the market dynamics have changed materially over the last 6 to 9 months as we've seen more competition come in. We've seen channel consolidation downstream. And we've seen, as Mark mentioned earlier, the pace of ANDAs coming out of the agency from an approval perspective increasing, which led to our comments earlier around we see some of the challenges in this space continuing into 2017. As it relates to a divestiture or sale, we are very open as it relates to anything that makes good financial sense where we can drive our return on invested capital for the long haul. So in this market environment, if someone were to offer us a great premium for any asset in the portfolio, we would certainly take a look at it. We are very focused on our leverage ratio.

Price is increasingly less of a dynamic for Acthar on a go-forward basis. And certainly, in this quarter, the bulk of the growth on Acthar, the 9% growth that we demonstrated in this quarter was volume-related. With regards to the hub, again, this is kind of a continuous improvement-type project. So we will probably never be done with the hub. We're always looking to continually improve our efficiency in that particular aspect of our distribution chain. Keep in mind, though, that even if we were completely 100% perfect in the hub, which is our objective over time, that this is not necessarily a significant driver of Acthar volume. What really drives Acthar volume, frankly, are market access activities that we've done -- that we continue to report on. It's the generation of new data, which again we continue to make significant progress around, and it's our commercial and medical affairs activities that are really going to drive the volume growth for Acthar over time. In terms of number of patients on Acthar, again we're in that range of 10,000 to 11,000 patients or so in any given year on Acthar. And again, our objective is to create more access for Acthar longer term to drive that 3% to 4% patient penetration rate that we have certainly to something significantly higher than that over time. And the 2 levers to do that are securing access and managed care and generating new data. That's our primary strategy for Acthar over the long term. I'll ask Matt then to discuss a bit about the gross margin."

And going forward, you certainly will see continued pressure on this line. I would say, if you look at the earnings per share beep, [ph] if you will, from this morning, we continue to get great efficacy out of our restructuring. SG&A is probably better than external estimates. I was happy to see that. This being said, we do have some investments we need to do in the back half of the year. And then our share repurchases certainly also helped us from an earnings per share perspective. So it's very manageable. We're going to navigate through it.

We've -- we just started starting contracts now less than a year ago, and it will be in another few months where we actually see whether or not these contracts are performing or not. But clearly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for Acthar is significantly enhanced by having greater access in managed care and signing contracts and having the majority of covered lives -- covered commercial lives under contract, we believe, is a great opportunity for Acthar. And again, this opportunity is one that really just creates access, and then it's up to us to come in with the appropriate data. And that's why we're so focus on data generation. That's data generation across the spectrum of data sets, whether it's preclinical or clinical data, whether it's health economic assessments, whether it's patient registries. There's a variety of data modernization activities that we're undertaking. And again, that's why we have consistently described the fact that we believe that the long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar is in that mid-single to low double-digit range. We're doing a lot of the work upfront with managed care now to ensure access and then bringing the data in behind it. Yes, there are some gross-to-net reductions that are going on. And again, that's why we believe, going forward, the majority of Acthar growth in that range that we've described is likely to be predominantly, if not wholly, volume-driven. And that's our objective. That's our strategy across the board. We look for opportunities where we can drive volume. When there's lots of patient penetration opportunities in Acthar, really a classic example of that. So again, really pleased with the Acthar performance in the quarter, very pleased with the Acthar performance in the first half of the year. It's been a bit better and a bit stronger than we had anticipated, but we're very pleased that we're generating more data and creating more access in managed care through our contracting strategy."

So again, with regards to Acthar and having covered lives under contract, our objective is to get the majority of covered lives under contract. And you can argue that greater than 15% [ph] now, we've achieved that initial goal. But long term, we like to get that number to significantly higher than that. What's the ultimate number is hard to predict at this point. And again, when we signed contracts, it's not about signing contracts. We could get 100% covered lives under contract if we chose to. We want to sign contracts that are beneficial both for the business and for the plan and give us an opportunity to generate greater access for Acthar. So again, the numbers certainly longer term is higher than 50. We continue to engage very actively with managed care organizations to look for contracting opportunities. It's less than 100, so it's somewhere between 50 and 100 is our longer-term objective. With regards to INOMAX. We are very, very pleased with the performance that we've seen with INOMAX. Again, keep in mind, historically, this is a business that had grown in the mid-single-digit range. And since we've been the owners of this asset, we've clearly accelerated that now for 3 straight quarters. This is a result of a different approach to the marketplace from a commercial perspective where we contract primarily with major accounts to provide unlimited access and that's good for patients because more patients have access to this therapy, which can be life-changing. It typically takes price off the table for many accounts because you're contracting for unlimited use, so providers don't have to choose which patients get INOMAX and which don't. And we're essentially getting account certainty and what their budget is. So it's a significant advantage for our business as well, and you can clearly see that we've been able to accelerate the growth rate of that business now into the low double-digit range. And for 2016, it's clear that INOMAX will grow at a rate significantly higher than the traditional mid-single-digit growth rate. In any given year, the majority of our patients -- or majority of our customers are likely to be on some form of a contract. Again, the typical INOMAX model is they contract for the entire bucket of services, which includes the drug, the device, the training, all of the disposables. That's the type of model that we've established that it seems to be very appealing and very successful to the majority of our customers."

And again, that's been the primary driver in the first couple of quarters of this double-digit growth. Longer term, again, we would expect this business to be in that mid-single-digit range that it's been historically simply because of the fact that the number of -- the patient opportunity, if you will, would kind of continue to grow at the rate of population growth. So again, we've changed the dynamics here in 2016. We've given it a lift. But we would expect longer term for that business to return to more historical growth rates. And again, we're seeing the same type of dynamic with Therakos. First couple of quarters have clearly been a bit above what the historical growth rates have been, but we would expect the dynamics to return back to what they've been historically, again just based on patient opportunities and patient population. In terms of OFIRMEV, your second question, again, real pleased with OFIRMEV that we were able to demonstrate year-on-year growth.

Again, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the terlipressin registration trial. We have a single Phase III protocol where we've established an SPA with the FDA. We recently come to an agreement on that protocol, so both the company and the FDA are in complete agreement as to how the protocol will be structured. And we'll be starting that trial in the second half of this fiscal year. Terlipressin is a very interesting product for us. It's an orphan drug, but it's used outside the U.S. as standard of care for patients that have a very devastating condition called hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Life expectancy for patients that get diagnosed with this condition can be measured in weeks. This product is not available in the U.S., and it's one that we think fits very squarely within our strategic objectives and would be a very important hospital product for us.

And that's why we put in our remarks that we expect this pressure to continue into '17. I'd say from how it's unfolded for the first half of the year and how we're thinking about the back half of the year, it's been keeping with where thinking was late last year. And we started the discussion around the challenges in the Specialty Generics business in May of last year on our earnings call. Actually, we're at the anniversary of it. We highlighted it again in August. And so we've been talking about this for some time. And I'd say the near term from where we were in May and where we were in August is playing out in line with expectations, but I'd say, as we get into '17, it looks to be tough. I'd say the principal or the bigger challenge has been the amount of approvals that have been coming through for new ANDAs. Downstream consolidation has certainly occurred, but I'd say the competitive marketplace has gotten tougher, and that's where the lion's share of that pressure is coming from."

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our exp",1420,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our expectations, both for this quarter and for the first half of fiscal 2016. We remain focused on company-wide execution, giving us confidence that we'll continue to make steady gains throughout the balance of the year. 
As Matt will cover in more detail later, we've raised our adjusted EPS guidance range today for the second time since giving initial guidance back in October. 
Net sales grew up nearly 13% for the second quarter, driven by robust commercial performance in Specialty Brands, where we continue to see steady volume gains across the portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was notable as well, as Cole mentioned, up more than 18% for the quarter. This strong showing clearly demonstrates we are executing against our strategy to drive volume-based growth and create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders.
Our accelerated pace on a number of strategic fronts was reflected in the progress we made in the quarter. Let me share just a couple of key highlights with you. We've continued to generate new clinical and health economic data, building on the growing body of evidence for our products. In the quarter, we had approximately 10 data presentations and publications, the majority of which were for Acthar and OFIRMEV, bringing the overall total of publications to roughly 40 in the first half of the year. And importantly, as I mentioned, we continued to execute against the key commercial levers we've identified to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth across the Specialty Brands segment. This enabled us to more than offset the ongoing challenges we faced in the Specialty Generics segment. We expect continued pressure in that business for the foreseeable future, consistent with previous guidance. 
Let me step back a moment to put our Specialty Brands performance into perspective. Growing volumes across this segment equate to expanded patient access to powerful, potentially life-changing therapies. Here are just a few examples. More surgical patients may benefit from receiving OFIRMEV as part of a multimodal approach to surgical pain management, potentially reducing their hospital stay and complications and thereby reducing health care system costs. We can reach more infants suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure who can benefit from INOMAX therapy. More lupus patients experiencing an exacerbation of their disease can potentially achieve relief through Acthar treatment. Increased numbers of infants suffering from infantile spasms are able to receive Acthar therapy to treat their devastating symptoms. And we're enabling more patients suffering from skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to harness the power of their own immune systems to fight this condition through Therakos immunotherapy. These examples illustrate why we believe so strongly in our established, acquire-to-invest strategy, identifying under-resourced, highly durable assets with significant volume growth potential and investing in them to expand access to underserved patient populations. Our formula for continued growth is working well, and looking ahead, we remain focused on sustaining this performance. 
Now let's look at key products in Specialty Brands. Focus on commercial execution across all therapeutic categories delivered another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up nearly 9% in the period propelled predominantly by steady volume growth. Pulmonology and rheumatology, where we believe we're beginning to see positive prescriber response to our recently published lupus data, continued to demonstrate strong growth. We've also begun to see a steady uptick in growth and market share for infantile spasms, where we're concentrating on further expanding access in this population of fragile patients.
We're also very pleased that with our ongoing focus on expanding access to Acthar, we've continued to sign new payer agreements. At this point, we've reached our initial goal to have greater than 50% of covered commercialized under contract a bit earlier than expected. Market access for Acthar will remain an area of high focus for us.
Now let me give you some color on INOMAX, our second-largest product. Once again, the business delivered another strong quarter, with net sales up 14% on a pro forma basis as we continue to successfully execute on our contracting strategy. This business has now exceeded historical growth rates in each of the 3 full quarters we've owned the asset, driven by strong commercial execution as appropriate patients have greater access to INOMAX. Longer term, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates, with growth closer to historical norms in the back half of the year.
Still focused on hospital products, in our second full quarter of ownership, we continued to be very pleased by the performance of the Therakos platform, with net sales growth of 13% on a pro forma basis on a constant currency basis. While we're pleased with this strong initial performance, we expect to see growth going forward to be in the historical high single-digit range.
Moving into the surgical space. I'm happy to report that we were able to achieve 4% revenue growth for OFIRMEV, a return to year-on-year growth earlier than we had expected. These results were principally driven by volume growth through strong execution by the commercial team. We remain confident this upward trajectory will continue in the second half of fiscal 2016, bolstered by recent presentations of additional health economic data and growing acceptance of the benefits that multimodal analgesia brings to patients in the health care system.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We were pleased that our latest acquisitions in the hemostasis space also performed well, although it's still very early. We're investing in the commercialization of all of these products, leveraging our OFIRMEV sales organization to promote RECOTHROM, in addition to the contracting model traditionally employed. As noted previously, we expect to launch PreveLeak and RAPLIXA late in the back half of this fiscal year.
Turning to Specialty Generics. We continue to value the cash flow generated by this business and the benefits it provides to patients. But the business continues to face significant competitive headwinds that we've been anticipating for some time, with net sales down 27% for the quarter. Though this downward trajectory may level off slightly in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the challenges in this business will likely continue to be compounded by the impact of downstream consolidation of pharmacy providers and heightened competition. 
Touching on science and technology or S&T. We continue to invest in programs to support key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands. Among these investments, we expect the first patient to be enrolled in the coming weeks in our company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, double-blind trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome condition called FSGS. We also continued to evaluate opportunities to conduct Acthar Phase IV-controlled trials in other key disease areas, and we'll  update you when these decisions are made. Simultaneously, we continue to generate additional data sets for Acthar, including preclinical and clinical data, patient registries and health economic assessments as well as sponsoring investigator-initiated trials.
Here are some key S&T highlights for other areas in the portfolio for the quarter. We engaged in productive discussions with the FDA regarding final comments on our special protocol assessment submission for the terlipressin registration trial, and I'm pleased to report we recently received approval for the Phase III protocol. We plan to start the trial later this fiscal year. 
We also saw continued progress in several OFIRMEV Phase IV clinical trials, with data expected on a portion of these later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're pursuing a robust program to develop health economic data for OFIRMEV, with a number of recent presentations highlighted in press releases that can be found on our website.
Finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing.
On the business development front, our key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms of hospital and Autoimmune and Rare Diseases as well as Specialty Generics. We're actively assessing a robust set of highly attractive opportunities and expect to continue adding developmental and commercial assets to our portfolio in coming quarters.
As we look ahead to the second half of 2016, the message is simple. By continuing to execute on the time-proven strategic methods that we know bring value to patients and shareholders, we're confident we'll reach our goals.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt?"

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, second quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, and Specialty Brands results fueled by our volume growth strategy were exceptionally robust. Net sales from continuing operations were $918 million, representing growth of 13%. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are increasing our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $8.15 to $8.50. This raises the low end of the range by $0.30 per share and the upper end by $0.20.
Second quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $535 million, representing growth of 60%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX, Therakos and the recent addition of RECOTHROM. Acthar outperformed our lower -- longer-range expectations in the quarter, with $248 million in net sales, a 9% increase. As we've said, we continue to believe that this franchise will grow at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range for at least the next several quarters. We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $116 million in net sales, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. With this continued strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis, but we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to be in the mid-single-digit range.
The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $50 million, a 13% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 4%. As Mark noted, we're pleased to have the hemostasis portfolio integrated into our hospital business, and we continue to stand by our long-term estimate of low double-digit growth, driven substantially by the product launches late this fiscal year.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw the toughest comparisons yet in the second quarter with net sales of $264 million, representing a 27% decline over prior year and anticipate similar results next quarter. While we expect comparisons to ease somewhat in the fourth quarter, we believe we're likely to see continued tough competitive market dynamics in the fiscal 2017.
Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $102 million, a 5% decline. This reflects the anticipated return to historical performance indicated on our first quarter earnings call.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined as anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics drove these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance.
While absolute R&D spending in the quarter was up slightly over prior year, this came in below our expectations. We're focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the second half of fiscal 2016 and beyond. R&D for the quarter came in at 6.4% of net sales overall, with investment in our Specialty Brands segment higher. 
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined as we continued to achieve savings from restructuring. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect some additive SG&A expense related to normal business activities as well as launch costs around our 2 new hemostasis products, PreveLeak and RAPLIXA.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.7% compared to 20.2%. We expect some upward pressure on this percentage in the second half of the fiscal year due primarily to business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $186 million. We also repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock in the quarter, returning $225 million of cash to shareholders. Overall liquidity and leverage remain very manageable. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $341 million despite the outlays for the hemostasis acquisition and the aggressive share repurchases. Our net debt leverage ratio was a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. We continue to focus on free cash flow, combining excellent cash conversion from earnings with a vigilant eye on working capital management, and we expect our strong free cash flow to continue throughout 2016 and beyond.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

We will have that affecting us in our fiscal fourth quarter, the September quarter of this year, and that will give us 14 weeks of revenues and earnings that quarter versus our typical 13-week quarter. And of course, that will be a comparable that we'll have to compare against the next year. Hopefully, that addresses your question. Mark, do you want to address the [indiscernible]."

First of all, let me say that we're very pleased with the Acthar performance that we've seen in the first half of the year and certainly in this quarter. It's performed a bit stronger than we expected. In terms of the go-forward growth rate, again, we believe that this product will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range kind of on the lower end for the next couple of quarters, and the rationale for that is pretty straightforward. I mean, we were very pleased to announce today that we've continued to sign payer contracts to procure and secure longer-term access for Acthar within the managed care environment. Clearly, that has downward pressure on pricing for us. And again, while we feel very comfortable that Acthar will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range because of this dynamic, we would expect it will be towards the lower end of that range near term. We do expect longer term for the growth rate to accelerate over time. Now we're very pleased that we've achieved our initial goal of having the majority of commercial lives under contract now for Acthar, but we're not done. We want to continue to engage with payers, continue to drive access for Acthar over the long term."

So look -- and when we look at our overall portfolio, we are very pleased that we have a diversified portfolio. If you keep in mind, we have 3 platforms now, each of which are roughly $1 billion or more in revenue. And we like that diversification. The Generics business for us, specifically, is a bit over $1 billion in annualized revenue. It generates great cash flow for us and clearly provides a lot of benefits to patients for the generic products that we supply in the markets in which we compete. There's no doubt that this is a challenging and very competitive market at the moment. The dynamics are such where we're seeing a lot more competition. We just saw some statistics recently where the rate of ANDA approvals through the FDA is accelerating, so there's certainly been more competition in our space and across the Generics space. We're also seeing some consolidation, certainly, on the customer sides of things, which are driving prices down. And again, I think we've seen some of our competitors in the space deliver some challenging results in the last couple of quarters. However, at the end of the day, this is a tremendous cash flow generating business for us, and we use that cash flow very effectively to build out our portfolio. We build out our portfolio in Specialty Brands by harvesting and leveraging the cash that's generated from generics. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to acquire assets to further diversify our portfolio. Longer term, the Generics business, for us, is one that we want to have as a steady growth business. And so therefore, it may make sense for us to consider looking at alternatives to build out that business as well, and that's likely to come through acquisition and that would largely be augmenting our portfolio of both commercial products as well as developmental opportunities."

So certainly, that is an indication of how we're thinking about share repurchases. We did some modest debt reduction in the first quarter. We didn't do much in the second quarter, and that's because the spreads tightened pretty significantly. And from a return perspective -- from a return on invested capital perspective, we felt it made more sense to focus on share repurchases.

We're very pleased with the diversification that we have today, but we want to build on the commercial platforms that we've created. And you can see we're starting to build some momentum now from a research and development standpoint. When we buy things, we invest in them. We enhance the labels. We create more data. We bring new products to market in the case of terlipressin, if, in fact, we're successful with that development program.

But as it relates to the broader controlled substance business, for oxycodone, hydrocodone and so on, prices we're getting a lot of pressure. Price was down, for sure, for total Mallinckrodt in the second quarter. Fortuitously for us, we're able to offset that with volume, particularly in our Specialty Brands business, as Mark mentioned earlier. As it relates to supplementing the portfolio, I'd say we're agnostic to the therapeutic areas, but we're interested in products that have a limited amount of competitive intensity. So we intentionally call our segment Specialty Generics because we don't want to compete in broad generic businesses. We like more niche areas in the Specialty Generics space.

And again, I think that's on the basis of much like many of the other indications that Acthar has, as we improve, enhance and modernize the data set, which we've been very aggressive in doing, that information then enables us to demonstrate the value of Acthar and the benefit that Acthar can bring to patients. And that's been very true in the pulmonology space where there's been an emerging body of evidence to come out here in recent months around Acthar's use in sarcoidosis, where there are very few alternatives for patients. We've also seen a continued strength across the rheumatology portfolio, but clearly, the lupus data is starting to gain some traction with many physicians. And again, we will be reporting on the open-label extension on the lupus trial that we reported on a little bit earlier. That open-label extension, we expect, will be able to report out that data towards the second half of this year. But again, we continue to invest in a variety of different data sets for Acthar, and those are the types of pieces of evidence that are helping us have appropriate conversations with physicians and with payers about the appropriate position for Acthar across the portfolio. But we've also seen certainly a bit of a resurgence in the use of Acthar for infantile spasms. We've refocused some of our activities into child neurology. Keep in mind, Acthar has very, very strong data for the -- for use in infantile spasms. Again, this is a tremendously devastating disease for patients. And so we've seen now a steady uptick in the growth and market share for infantile spasms as a result of our reemphasis on that particular specialty and that particular indication."

This being said, I think the market dynamics have changed materially over the last 6 to 9 months as we've seen more competition come in. We've seen channel consolidation downstream. And we've seen, as Mark mentioned earlier, the pace of ANDAs coming out of the agency from an approval perspective increasing, which led to our comments earlier around we see some of the challenges in this space continuing into 2017.

With regards to the hub, again, this is kind of a continuous improvement type project. So we will probably never be done with the hub. We're always looking to continually improve our efficiency in that particular aspect of our distribution chain. Keep in mind though that even if we were completely 100% perfect in the hub, which is our objective over time, that this is not necessarily a significant driver of Acthar volume. What really drives Acthar volume, frankly, are market access activities that we've done -- that we continue to report on. It's the generation of new data, which, again, we continue to make significant progress around, and it's our commercial and medical affairs activities that are really going to drive the volume growth for Acthar over time. In terms of number of patients on Acthar, again, we're in that range of 10,000 to 11,000 patients or so in any given year on Acthar. And again, our objective is to create more access for Acthar longer term to drive that 3% to 4% patient penetration rate that we have certainly to something significantly higher than that over time. And the 2 levers to do that are securing access in managed care and generating new data, and that's our primary strategy for Acthar over the long term.

I would say, if you look at the earnings per share beat, [ph] if you will, from this morning, we continue to get great efficacy out of our restructuring. So our SG&A is probably better than external estimates. I was happy to see that. This being said, we do have some investments we need to do in the back half of the year, and then our share repurchases certainly also helped us from an earnings per share perspective. So it's very manageable. We're going to navigate through it. But I hope that people heard us very clearly on February 3 and are not expecting it to change dramatically as we move forward from where it is today."

My understanding is, as you guys kind of move towards this paper performance type of dynamic that we might be heading into a situation around this quarter and next quarter that there might be greater gross-to-net deductions and sort of a net impact on pricing, but it sounds to me like you're not getting any negative impact on pricing and you're getting the performance, I guess, aspirations or targets. They're growing without any pressure on price. So is it fair to assume now that this strategic shift to contracting is paying out as planned?"

We've -- we just started signing contracts now less than a year ago, and it will be in another few months where we actually see whether or not these contracts are performing or not. But clearly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for Acthar is significantly enhanced by having greater access in managed care and signing contracts and having the majority of covered lives -- covered commercial lives under contract, we believe, is a great opportunity for Acthar. And again, this opportunity is one that really just creates access, and then it's up to us to come in with the appropriate data. And that's why we're so focused on data generation. That's data generation across the spectrum of data sets, whether it's preclinical or clinical data, whether it's health economic assessments, whether it's patient registries, there's a variety of data modernization activities that we're undertaking. And again, that's why we have consistently described the fact that we believe that the long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar is in that mid-single to low double-digit range. We're doing a lot of the work upfront with managed care now to ensure access and then bringing the data in behind it. Yes, there are some gross-to-net reductions that are going on. And again, that's why we believe, going forward, the majority of Acthar growth in that range that we've described is likely to be predominantly, if not wholly volume-driven. And that's our objective. That's our strategy across the board. We look for opportunities where we can drive volume, where there's lots of patient penetration opportunities in Acthar is really a classic example of that. So again, we were real pleased with the Acthar performance in the quarter, very pleased with the Acthar performance in the first half of the year. It's been a bit better and a bit stronger than we had anticipated, but we're very pleased that we're generating more data and creating more access in managed care through our contracting strategy."

So again, with regards to Acthar and having covered lives under contract, our objective is to get the majority of covered lives under contract. Then you could argue that greater than 15% now, we've achieved that initial goal. But long term, we would",417,"Yes. So again, with regards to Acthar and having covered lives under contract, our objective is to get the majority of covered lives under contract. Then you could argue that greater than 15% now, we've achieved that initial goal. But long term, we would like to get that number to significantly higher than that. What's the ultimate number is hard to predict at this point. And again, when we sign contracts, it's not about signing contracts. We could get 100% covered lives under contract, if we chose to. We want to sign contracts that are beneficial, both for the business and for the plan and give us an opportunity to generate greater access for Acthar. So again, the number certainly longer term is higher than 50%. We continue to engage very actively with managed care organizations to look for contracting opportunities. It's less than 100, so it's somewhere between 50% and 100% is our longer-term objective. With regards to INOMAX. We are very, very pleased with the performance that we've seen with INOMAX. Again, keep in mind, historically, this is a business that had grown in the mid-single-digit range. And since we've been the owners of this asset, we've clearly accelerated that now for 3 straight quarters. This is a result of a different approach to the marketplace from a commercial perspective where we contract primarily with major accounts to provide unlimited access and that's good for patients because more patients have access to this therapy, which can be life-changing. It typically takes price off the table for many accounts because you're contracting for unlimited use. So providers don't have to choose which patients get INOMAX and which don't. And we're essentially giving account certainty and what their budget is. So it's a significant advantage for our business as well, and you can clearly see that we've been able to accelerate the growth rate of that business now into the low double-digit range. And for 2016, it's clear that INOMAX will grow at a rate significantly higher than the traditional mid-single-digit growth rate. In any given year, the majority of our patients -- majority of our customers are likely to be on some form of a contract. Again, the typical INOMAX model is the contract for the entire bucket of services, which includes the drug, the device, the training, all of the disposables. That's the type of model that we've established that it seems to be very appealing and very successful to the majority of our customers."

And so again, we've been able to go into a number of accounts and deliver some very appealing terms on unlimited use for INOMAX. And again, that's been the primary driver in the first couple of quarters of this double-digit growth. Longer term, again, we would expect this business to be in that mid-single-digit range that it's been historically, simply because of the fact that the number of -- the patient opportunity, if you will, would kind of continue to grow at the rate of population growth. So again, we've changed the dynamics here in 2016. We've given it a lift. But we would expect longer term for that business to return to more historical growth rates. And again, we're seeing the same type of dynamic with Therakos. First couple of quarters have clearly been a bit above what the historical growth rates have been, but we would expect the dynamics to return back to what they've been historically, again just based on patient opportunities and patient population. In terms of OFIRMEV, your second question, again, real pleased with OFIRMEV that we were able to demonstrate year-on-year growth. As we mentioned in the last quarter, we were expecting OFIRMEV to grow year-on-year in the second half of the fiscal year, and we were hopeful that we could accelerate that a bit into the second quarter and that's, in fact, what happened. Certainly, there was some destocking that went on in the previous quarter.

The return to historical growth rates over time is likely to be the result of some of the anniversary-ing of the contracts, again, over time. Let me just finish up on terlipressin. Again, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the terlipressin registration trial. We have a single Phase III protocol where we've established an SPA with the FDA. We've recently come to an agreement on that protocol. So both the company and the FDA are in complete agreement as to how the protocol will be structured, and we'll be starting that trial in the second half of this fiscal year. Terlipressin is a very interesting product for us. It's an orphan drug, but it's used outside the U.S. as standard of care for patients that have a very devastating condition called Hepato-Renal Syndrome Type 1. Life expectancy for patients that get diagnosed with this condition can be measured in weeks. This product is not available in the U.S., and it's one that we think fits very squarely within our strategic objectives and would be a very important hospital product for us. So this will take several years for us to develop this protocol, but we believe the opportunity is very attractive and very consistent with what we're trying to do strategically."

I'd say from how it's unfolded for the first half of the year and how we're thinking about the back half of the year, it's been keeping with where our thinking was late last year. And we started the discussion around the challenges in the Specialty Generics business in May of last year on our earnings call. Actually, we're at the anniversary of it. We highlighted it again in August, and so we've been talking about this for some time. And I'd say the near term from where we were in May and where we were in August is playing out in line with expectations. But I'd say, as we get into '17, it looks to be tough.

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our exp",1420,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our expectations, both for this quarter and for the first half of fiscal 2016. We remain focused on company-wide execution, giving us confidence that we'll continue to make steady gains throughout the balance of the year. 
As Matt will cover in more detail later, we've raised our adjusted EPS guidance range today for the second time since giving initial guidance back in October. Net sales were up nearly 13% for the second quarter, driven by robust commercial performance in Specialty Brands, where we continue to see steady volume gains across the portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was notable as well, as Cole mentioned, up more than 18% for the quarter. This strong showing clearly demonstrates we are executing against our strategy to drive volume-based growth and create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders.
Our accelerated pace on a number of strategic fronts was reflected in the progress we made in the quarter. Let me share just a couple of key highlights with you. We've continued to generate new clinical and health economic data, building on the growing body of evidence for our products. In the quarter, we had approximately 10 data presentations and publications, the majority of which were for Acthar and OFIRMEV, bringing the overall total of publications to roughly 40 in the first half of the year. And importantly, as I mentioned, we continued to execute against the key commercial levers we've identified to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth across the Specialty Brands segment. This enabled us to more than offset the ongoing challenges we faced in the Specialty Generics segment. We expect continued pressure in that business for the foreseeable future, consistent with previous guidance. 
Let me step back a moment to put our Specialty Brands performance into perspective. Growing volumes across this segment equate to expanded patient access to powerful, potentially life-changing therapies. Here are just a few examples. More surgical patients may benefit from receiving OFIRMEV as part of a multimodal approach to surgical pain management, potentially reducing their hospital stay and complications and thereby reducing health care system costs. We can reach more infants suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure who can benefit from INOMAX therapy. More lupus patients experiencing an exacerbation of their disease can potentially achieve relief through Acthar treatments. Increased numbers of infants suffering from infantile spasms are able to receive Acthar therapy to treat their devastating symptoms. And we're enabling more patients suffering from skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to harness the power of their own immune systems to fight this condition through Therakos immunotherapy. These examples illustrate why we believe so strongly in our established, acquire-to-invest strategy, identifying under-resourced, highly durable assets with significant volume growth potential and investing in them to expand access to underserved patient populations. Our formula for continued growth is working well, and looking ahead, we remain focused on sustaining this performance. 
Now let's look at key products in Specialty Brands. Focus on commercial execution across all therapeutic categories delivered another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up nearly 9% in the period propelled predominantly by steady volume growth. Pulmonology and rheumatology, where we believe we're beginning to see positive prescriber response to our recently published lupus data, continued to demonstrate strong growth. We've also begun to see a steady uptick in growth and market share for infantile spasms, where we're concentrating on further expanding access in this population of fragile patients. We're also very pleased that with our ongoing focus on expanding access to Acthar, we've continued to sign new payer agreements. At this point, we've reached our initial goal to have greater than 50% of covered commercialized under contract a bit earlier than expected. Market access for Acthar will remain an area of high focus for us.
Now let me give you some color on INOMAX, our second-largest product. Once again, the business delivered another strong quarter, with net sales up 14% on a pro forma basis as we continue to successfully execute on our contracting strategy. This business has now exceeded historical growth rates in each of the 3 full quarters we've owned the asset, driven by strong commercial execution as appropriate patients have greater access to INOMAX. Longer term, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates, with growth closer to historical norms in the back half of the year. Still focused on hospital products, in our second full quarter of ownership, we continued to be very pleased by the performance of the Therakos platform, with net sales growth of 13% on a pro forma basis on a constant currency basis. While we're pleased with this strong initial performance, we expect to see growth going forward to be in the historical high single-digit range.
Moving into the surgical space. I'm happy to report that we were able to achieve 4% revenue growth for OFIRMEV, a return to year-on-year growth earlier than we had expected. These results were principally driven by volume growth through strong execution by the commercial team. We remain confident this upward trajectory will continue in the second half of fiscal 2016, bolstered by recent presentations of additional health economic data and growing acceptance of the benefits that multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We were pleased that our latest acquisitions in the hemostasis space also performed well, although it's still very early. We're investing in the commercialization of all of these products, leveraging our OFIRMEV sales organization to promote RECOTHROM, in addition to the contracting model traditionally employed. As noted previously, we expect to launch PreveLeak and RAPLIXA late in the back half of this fiscal year.
Turning to Specialty Generics. We continue to value the cash flow generated by this business and the benefits it provides to patients. But the business continues to face significant competitive headwinds that we've been anticipating for some time, with net sales down 27% for the quarter. Though this downward trajectory may level out slightly in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the challenges in this business will likely continue to be compounded by the impact of downstream consolidation of pharmacy providers and heightened competition. 
Touching on science and technology or S&T. We continue to invest in programs to support key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands. Among these investments, we expect the first patient to be enrolled in the coming weeks in our company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, double-blind trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome condition called FSGS. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to conduct Acthar Phase IV-controlled trials in other key disease areas, and we'll update you when these decisions are made. Simultaneously, we continue to generate additional data sets for Acthar, including preclinical and clinical data, patient registries and health economic assessments as well as sponsoring investigator-initiated trials.
Here are some key S&T highlights for other areas in the portfolio for the quarter. We engaged in productive discussions with the FDA regarding final comments on our special protocol assessment submission for the terlipressin registration trial, and I'm pleased to report we recently received approval for the Phase III protocol. We plan to start the trial later this fiscal year. We also saw continued progress in several OFIRMEV Phase IV clinical trials, with data expected on a portion of these later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're pursuing a robust program to develop health economic data for OFIRMEV, with a number of recent presentations highlighted in press releases that can be found on our website. Finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing.
On the business development front, our key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms of hospital and Autoimmune and Rare Diseases as well as Specialty Generics. We're actively assessing a robust set of highly attractive opportunities and expect to continue adding developmental and commercial assets to our portfolio in coming quarters. As we look ahead to the second half of 2016, the message is simple. By continuing to execute on the time-proven strategic methods that we know bring value to patients and shareholders, we're confident we'll reach our goals.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt?"

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, second quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, and Specialty Brands results fueled by our volume growth strategy were exceptionally robust. Net sales from continuing operations were $918 million, representing growth of 13%. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are increasing our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $8.15 to $8.50. This raises the low end of the range by $0.30 per share and the upper end by $0.20.
Second quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $535 million, representing growth of 60%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX, Therakos and the recent addition of RECOTHROM. Acthar outperformed our lower -- longer-range expectations in the quarter, with $248 million in net sales, a 9% increase. As we've said, we continue to believe that this franchise will grow at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range for at least the next several quarters. We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $116 million in net sales, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. With this continued strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis, but we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to be in the mid-single-digit range. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $50 million, a 13% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 4%. As Mark noted, we're pleased to have the hemostasis portfolio integrated into our hospital business, and we continue to stand by our long-term estimate of low double-digit growth, driven substantially by the product launches late this fiscal year.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw the toughest comparisons yet in the second quarter with net sales of $264 million, representing a 27% decline over prior year and anticipate similar results next quarter. While we expect comparisons to ease somewhat in the fourth quarter, we believe we're likely to see continued tough competitive market dynamics in the fiscal 2017. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $102 million, a 5% decline. This reflects the anticipated return to historical performance indicated on our first quarter earnings call. 
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined as anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics drove these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. While absolute R&D spending in the quarter was up slightly over prior year, this came in below our expectations. We're focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the second half of fiscal 2016 and beyond. R&D for the quarter came in at 6.4% of net sales overall, with investment in our Specialty Brands segment higher.  Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined as we continued to achieve savings from restructuring. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect some additive SG&A expense related to normal business activities as well as launch costs around our 2 new hemostasis products, PreveLeak and RAPLIXA. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.7% compared to 20.2%. We expect some upward pressure on this percentage in the second half of the fiscal year due primarily to business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $186 million. We also repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock in the quarter, returning $225 million of cash to shareholders. Overall liquidity and leverage remain very manageable. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $341 million, despite the outlays for the hemostasis acquisition and the aggressive share repurchases. Our net debt leverage ratio was a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. We continue to focus on free cash flow, combining excellent cash conversion from earnings with a vigilant eye on working capital management, and we expect our strong free cash flow to continue throughout 2016 and beyond.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

But as you noted, and as you've heard us talk about, and I'm going to take this opportunity to remind you, one of the things that happens with this accounting convention is every 5 to 6 years, there's a 1-week catch-up period. We will have that affecting us in our fiscal fourth quarter, the September quarter of this year, and that will give us 14 weeks of revenues and earnings that quarter versus our typical 13-week quarter.

In terms of the go-forward growth rate, again, we believe that this product will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range kind of on the lower end for the next couple of quarters, and the rationale for that is pretty straightforward. I mean, we were very pleased to announce today that we've continued to sign payer contracts to procure and secure longer-term access for Acthar within the managed care environment. Clearly, that has downward pressure on pricing for us. And again, while we feel very comfortable that Acthar will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range because of this dynamic, we would expect it'll be towards the lower end of that range near term. We do expect longer term for the growth rate to accelerate over time. Now we're very pleased that we've achieved our initial goal of having the majority of commercial lives under contract now for Acthar, but we're not done.

So look -- and when we look at our overall portfolio, we are very pleased that we have a diversified portfolio. If you keep in mind, we have 3 platforms now, each of which are roughly $1 billion or more in revenue. And we like that diversification. The Generics business for us, specifically, is a bit over $1 billion in annualized revenue. It generates great cash flow for us and clearly provides a lot of benefits to patients for the generic products that we supply in the markets in which we compete. There's no doubt that this is a challenging and very competitive market at the moment. The dynamics are such where we're seeing a lot more competition. We just saw some statistics recently where the rate of ANDA approvals through the FDA is accelerating, so there's certainly been more competition in our space and across the Generics space. We're also seeing some consolidation, certainly, on the customer sides of things, which are driving prices down. And again, I think we've seen some of our competitors in the space deliver some challenging results in the last couple of quarters. However, at the end of the day, this is a tremendous cash flow generating business for us, and we use that cash flow very effectively to build out our portfolio. We build out our portfolio in Specialty Brands by harvesting and leveraging the cash that's generated from generics. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to acquire assets to further diversify our portfolio. Longer term, the Generics business, for us, is one that we want to have as a steady growth business. And so therefore, it may make sense for us to consider looking at alternatives to build out that business as well, and that's likely to come through acquisition and that would largely be augmenting our portfolio of both commercial products as well as developmental opportunities."

However, keep in mind that we're building a business for long-term value creation, and we believe very strongly that there are a tremendous number of assets out there that fit the businesses that we're trying to grow and develop. And that's -- we have a need to further diversify our overall portfolio, both commercially and developmentally. We're very pleased with the diversification that we have today, but we want to build on the commercial platforms that we've created. And you can see we're starting to build some momentum now from a research and development standpoint. When we buy things, we invest in them. We enhance the labels. We create more data. We bring new products to market in the case of terlipressin, if, in fact, we're successful with that development program. We want to continue to add to both our commercial portfolio as well as our development portfolio because we think that's the recipe for success to driving long-term value."

We finished the quarter at $341 million, as you know, and I can tell you, we've been generating a ton of cash since then. And then in addition to that, we do have our revolver, of which we still have a $100 million in capacity there. Certainly, if we wanted to, we could likely increase the size of that revolver. So I would just say we don't feel constrained from the perspective of being able to accomplish business development and share repurchases. Keep in mind, we spent $175 million on the hemostasis products in early February. We repurchased $225 million in shares, and we ended the quarter with $341 million in cash. So fortuitously for us, the opportunity set for us is really being very careful on how we drive return on invested capital long term."

So that's how you should be thinking about it. And as we think about Q3, it's going to be a similar dynamic, and that's because we've got a number of competitors coming into the marketplace. The only exception to that would be Methylphenidate ER, which is the change in rating to Bx, which we've talked about now for a good 1.5 years. But as it relates to the broader controlled substance business, for oxycodone, hydrocodone and so on, price is where we're getting a lot of pressure. Price was down, for sure, for total Mallinckrodt in the second quarter. Fortuitously for us, we're able to offset that with volume, particularly in our Specialty Brands business, as Mark mentioned earlier. As it relates to supplementing the portfolio, I'd say we're agnostic to the therapeutic areas, but we're interested in products that have a limited amount of competitive intensity. So we intentionally call our segment Specialty Generics because we don't want to compete in broad generic businesses. We like more niche areas in the Specialty Generics space. And I'd be first to tell you, there's a number of opportunities out there. I think there's a viewpoint externally that there aren't a lot of opportunities from the business development front in the Specialty Generics landscape.

And again, I think that's on the basis of much like many of the other indications that Acthar has, as we improve, enhance and modernize the data set, which we've been very aggressive in doing, that information then enables us to demonstrate the value of Acthar and the benefit that Acthar can bring to patients. And that's been very true in the pulmonology space where there's been an emerging body of evidence to come out here in recent months around Acthar's use in sarcoidosis, where there are very few alternatives for patients. We've also seen a continued strength across the rheumatology portfolio, but clearly, the lupus data is starting to gain some traction with many physicians. And again, we will be reporting on the open-label extension on the lupus trial that we reported on a little bit earlier. That open-label extension, we expect, will be able to report out that data towards the second half of this year. But again, we continue to invest in a variety of different data sets for Acthar, and those are the types of pieces of evidence that are helping us have appropriate conversations with physicians and with payers about the appropriate positioning for Acthar across the portfolio. But we've also seen certainly a bit of a resurgence in the use of Acthar for infantile spasms. We've refocused some of our activities into child neurology. Keep in mind, Acthar has very, very strong data for the -- for use in infantile spasms. Again, this is a tremendously devastating disease for patients. And so we've seen now a steady uptick in the growth and market share for infantile spasms as a result of our reemphasis on that particular specialty and that particular indication."

And I would say, from a volume perspective, the market, fortuitously for us, is probably pretty close to playing out as we expected it to. This being said, I think the market dynamics have changed materially over the last 6 to 9 months as we've seen more competition come in. We've seen channel consolidation downstream. And we've seen, as Mark mentioned earlier, the pace of ANDAs coming out of the agency from an approval perspective increasing, which led to our comments earlier around we see some of the challenges in this space continuing into 2017. As it relates to a divestiture or sale, we are very open as it relates to anything that makes good financial sense where we can drive our return on invested capital for the long haul. So in this market environment, if someone were to offer us a great premium for any asset in the portfolio, we would certainly take a look at it. We are very focused on our leverage ratio.

With regards to the hub, again, this is kind of a continuous improvement type project. So we will probably never be done with the hub. We're always looking to continually improve our efficiency in that particular aspect of our distribution chain. Keep in mind though that even if we were completely 100% perfect in the hub, which is our objective over time, that this is not necessarily a significant driver of Acthar volume. What really drives Acthar volume, frankly, are our market access activities that we've done -- that we continue to report on. It's the generation of new data, which, again, we continue to make significant progress around, and it's our commercial and medical affairs activities that are really going to drive the volume growth for Acthar over time. In terms of number of patients on Acthar, again, we're in that range of 10,000 to 11,000 patients or so in any given year on Acthar. And again, our objective is to create more access for Acthar longer term to drive that 3% to 4% patient penetration rate that we have certainly to something significantly higher than that over time. And the 2 levers to do that are securing access in managed care and generating new data, and that's our primary strategy for Acthar over the long term.

And principally, what was driving that comment back on February 3 and what you see today is what has happened in the Specialty Generics business, which is in line with what we were thinking back then and line with what we're thinking back in October. And going forward, you certainly will see continued pressure on this line. I would say, if you look at the earnings per share beat, if you will, from this morning, we continue to get great efficacy out of our restructuring. So our SG&A is probably better than external estimates. I was happy to see that. This being said, we do have some investments we need to do in the back half of the year, and then our share repurchases certainly also helped us from an earnings per share perspective. So it's very manageable. We're going to navigate through it. But I hope that people heard us very clearly on February 3 and are not expecting it to change dramatically as we move forward from where it is today."

We've -- we just started signing contracts now less than a year ago, and it'll be in another few months where we actually see whether or not these contracts are performing or not. But clearly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for Acthar is significantly enhanced by having greater access in managed care and signing contracts and having the majority of covered lives -- covered commercial lives under contract, we believe, is a great opportunity for Acthar. And again, this opportunity is one that really just creates access, and then it's up to us to come in with the appropriate data. And that's why we're so focused on data generation. That's data generation across the spectrum of data sets, whether it's preclinical or clinical data, whether it's health economic assessments, whether it's patient registries, there's a whole variety of data modernization activities that we're undertaking. And again, that's why we have consistently described the fact that we believe that the long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar is in that mid-single to low double-digit range. We're doing a lot of the work upfront with managed care now to ensure access and then bringing the data in behind it. Yes, there are some gross-to-net reductions that are going on. And again, that's why we believe, going forward, the majority of Acthar growth in that range that we've described is likely to be predominantly, if not wholly volume-driven. And that's our objective. That's our strategy across the board. We look for opportunities where we can drive volume, where there's lots of patient penetration opportunities, and Acthar is really a classic example of that. So again, we were real pleased with the Acthar performance in the quarter, very pleased with the Acthar performance in the first half of the year. It's been a bit better and a bit stronger than we had anticipated, but we're very pleased that we're generating more data and creating more access in managed care through our contracting strategy."

But you could argue that greater than 15% now, we've achieved that initial goal. But long term, we would like to get that number to significantly higher than that. What's the ultimate number is hard to predict at this point. And again, when we sign contracts, it's not about signing contracts. We could get 100% covered lives under contract, if we chose to. We want to sign contracts that are beneficial, both for the business and for the plan and give us an opportunity to generate greater access for Acthar. So again, the number certainly longer term is higher than 50%. We continue to engage very actively with managed care organizations to look for contracting opportunities. It's less than 100%, so it's somewhere between 50% and 100% is our longer-term objective. With regards to INOMAX. We are very, very pleased with the performance that we've seen with INOMAX. Again, keep in mind, historically, this is a business that had grown in the mid-single-digit range. And since we've been the owners of this asset, we've clearly accelerated that now for 3 straight quarters. This is a result of a different approach to the marketplace from a commercial perspective where we contract primarily with major accounts to provide unlimited access and that's good for patients because more patients have access to this therapy, which can be life-changing. It typically takes price off the table for many accounts because you're contracting for unlimited use. So providers don't have to choose which patients get INOMAX and which don't. And we're essentially giving accounts certainty and what their budget is. So it's a significant advantage for our business as well, and you can clearly see that we've been able to accelerate the growth rate of that business now into the low double-digit range. And for 2016, it's clear that INOMAX will grow at a rate significantly higher than the traditional mid-single-digit growth rate. In any given year, the majority of our patients -- majority of our customers are likely to be on some form of a contract. Again, the typical INOMAX model is the contract for the entire bucket of services, which includes the drug, the device, the training, all of the disposables. That's the type of model that we've established that it seems to be very appealing and very successful to the majority of our customers."

And so again, we've been able to go into a number of accounts and deliver some very appealing terms on unlimited use for INOMAX. And again, that's been the primary driver in the first couple of quarters of this double-digit growth. Longer term, again, we would expect this business to be in that mid-single-digit range that it's been historically, simply because of the fact that the number of -- the patient opportunity, if you will, would kind of continue to grow at the rate of population growth. So again, we've changed the dynamics here in 2016. We've given it a lift. But we would expect longer term for that business to return to more historical growth rates. And again, we're seeing the same type of dynamic with Therakos. First couple of quarters have clearly been a bit above what the historical growth rates have been, but we would expect the dynamics to return back to what they've been historically, again just based on patient opportunities and patient population. In terms of OFIRMEV, your second question, again, real pleased with OFIRMEV that we were able to demonstrate year-on-year growth. As we mentioned in the last quarter, we were expecting OFIRMEV to grow year-on-year in the second half of the fiscal year, and we were hopeful that we could accelerate that a bit into the second quarter and that's, in fact, what happened. Certainly, there was some destocking that went on in the previous quarter. Some of that has continued in the second quarter, and we would expect that now by the back half of the year, most of that effect has moved out."

The return to historical growth rates over time is likely to be the result of some of the anniversary-ing of the contracts, again, over time. Let me just finish up on terlipressin. Again, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the terlipressin registration trial. We have a single Phase III protocol where we've established an SPA with the FDA. We've recently come to an agreement on that protocol. So both the company and the FDA are in complete agreement as to how the protocol will be structured, and we'll be starting that trial in the second half of this fiscal year. Terlipressin is a very interesting product for us. It's an orphan drug, but it's used outside the U.S. as standard of care for patients that have a very devastating condition called Hepato-Renal Syndrome Type 1. Life expectancy for patients that get diagnosed with this condition can be measured in weeks. This product is not available in the U.S., and it's one that we think fits very squarely within our strategic objectives and would be a very important hospital product for us. So this will take several years for us to develop this protocol, but we believe the opportunity is very attractive and very consistent with what we're trying to do strategically."

I'd say from how it's unfolded for the first half of the year and how we're thinking about the back half of the year, it's in keeping with where our thinking was late last year. And we started the discussion around the challenges in the Specialty Generics business in May of last year on our earnings call. Actually, we're at the anniversary of it. We highlighted it again in August, and so we've been talking about this for some time. And I'd say the near term from where we were in May and where we were in August is playing out in line with expectations. But I'd say, as we get into '17, it looks to be tough. I'd say the principal or the bigger challenge has been the amount of approvals that have been coming through for new ANDAs. Downstream consolidation has certainly occurred, but I'd say the competitive marketplace has gotten tougher, and that's where the lion's share of that pressure is coming from."

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another excellent quarter, driven by strong performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio. The business performed ahead of our expectations, both for this quarter and for the first half of fiscal 2016. We remain focused on company-wide execution, giving us confidence that we'll continue to make steady gains throughout the balance of the year. 
As Matt will cover in more detail later, we've raised our adjusted EPS guidance range today for the second time since giving initial guidance back in October. Net sales were up nearly 13% for the second quarter, driven by robust commercial performance in Specialty Brands, where we continue to see steady volume gains across the portfolio. Adjusted EPS growth was notable as well, as Cole mentioned, up more than 18% for the quarter. This strong showing clearly demonstrates we are executing against our strategy to drive volume-based growth and create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders.
Our accelerated pace on a number of strategic fronts was reflected in the progress we made in the quarter. Let me share just a couple of key highlights with you. We've continued to generate new clinical and health economic data, building on the growing body of evidence for our products. In the quarter, we had approximately 10 data presentations and publications, the majority of which were for Acthar and OFIRMEV, bringing the overall total of publications to roughly 40 in the first half of the year. And importantly, as I mentioned, we continued to execute against the key commercial levers we've identified to drive volume in both top and bottom line growth across the Specialty Brands segment. This enabled us to more than offset the ongoing challenges we faced in the Specialty Generics segment. We expect continued pressure in that business for the foreseeable future, consistent with previous guidance. 
Let me step back a moment to put our Specialty Brands performance into perspective. Growing volumes across this segment equate to expanded patient access to powerful, potentially life-changing therapies. Here are just a few examples. More surgical patients may benefit from receiving OFIRMEV as part of a multimodal approach to surgical pain management, potentially reducing their hospital stay and complications and thereby reducing health care system costs. We can reach more infants suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure who can benefit from INOMAX therapy. More lupus patients experiencing an exacerbation of their disease can potentially achieve relief through Acthar treatments. Increased numbers of infants suffering from infantile spasms are able to receive Acthar therapy to treat their devastating symptoms. And we're enabling more patients suffering from skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to harness the power of their own immune systems to fight this condition through Therakos immunotherapy. These examples illustrate why we believe so strongly in our established, acquire-to-invest strategy, identifying under-resourced, highly durable assets with significant volume growth potential and investing in them to expand access to underserved patient populations. Our formula for continued growth is working well, and looking ahead, we remain focused on sustaining this performance. 
Now let's look at key products in Specialty Brands. Focus on commercial execution across all therapeutic categories delivered another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up nearly 9% in the period propelled predominantly by steady volume growth. Pulmonology and rheumatology, where we believe we're beginning to see positive prescriber response to our recently published lupus data, continued to demonstrate strong growth. We've also begun to see a steady uptick in growth and market share for infantile spasms, where we're concentrating on further expanding access in this population of fragile patients. We're also very pleased that with our ongoing focus on expanding access to Acthar, we've continued to sign new payer agreements. At this point, we've reached our initial goal to have greater than 50% of covered commercialized under contract a bit earlier than expected. Market access for Acthar will remain an area of high focus for us.
Now let me give you some color on INOMAX, our second-largest product. Once again, the business delivered another strong quarter, with net sales up 14% on a pro forma basis as we continue to successfully execute on our contracting strategy. This business has now exceeded historical growth rates in each of the 3 full quarters we've owned the asset, driven by strong commercial execution as appropriate patients have greater access to INOMAX. Longer term, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates, with growth closer to historical norms in the back half of the year. Still focused on hospital products, in our second full quarter of ownership, we continued to be very pleased by the performance of the Therakos platform, with net sales growth of 13% on a pro forma basis on a constant currency basis. While we're pleased with this strong initial performance, we expect to see growth going forward to be in the historical high single-digit range.
Moving into the surgical space. I'm happy to report that we were able to achieve 4% revenue growth for OFIRMEV, a return to year-on-year growth earlier than we had expected. These results were principally driven by volume growth through strong execution by the commercial team. We remain confident this upward trajectory will continue in the second half of fiscal 2016, bolstered by recent presentations of additional health economic data and growing acceptance of the benefits that multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We were pleased that our latest acquisitions in the hemostasis space also performed well, although it's still very early. We're investing in the commercialization of all of these products, leveraging our OFIRMEV sales organization to promote RECOTHROM, in addition to the contracting model traditionally employed. As noted previously, we expect to launch PreveLeak and RAPLIXA late in the back half of this fiscal year.
Turning to Specialty Generics. We continue to value the cash flow generated by this business and the benefits it provides to patients. But the business continues to face significant competitive headwinds that we've been anticipating for some time, with net sales down 27% for the quarter. Though this downward trajectory may level out slightly in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the challenges in this business will likely continue to be compounded by the impact of downstream consolidation of pharmacy providers and heightened competition. 
Touching on science and technology or S&T. We continue to invest in programs to support key inline and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands. Among these investments, we expect the first patient to be enrolled in the coming weeks in our company-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, double-blind trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome condition called FSGS. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to conduct Acthar Phase IV-controlled trials in other key disease areas, and we'll update you when these decisions are made. Simultaneously, we continue to generate additional data sets for Acthar, including preclinical and clinical data, patient registries and health economic assessments as well as sponsoring investigator-initiated trials.
Here are some key S&T highlights for other areas in the portfolio for the quarter. We engaged in productive discussions with the FDA regarding final comments on our special protocol assessment submission for the terlipressin registration trial, and I'm pleased to report we recently received approval for the Phase III protocol. We plan to start the trial later this fiscal year. We also saw continued progress in several OFIRMEV Phase IV clinical trials, with data expected on a portion of these later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're pursuing a robust program to develop health economic data for OFIRMEV, with a number of recent presentations highlighted in press releases that can be found on our website. Finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing.
On the business development front, our key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms of hospital and Autoimmune and Rare Diseases as well as Specialty Generics. We're actively assessing a robust set of highly attractive opportunities and expect to continue adding developmental and commercial assets to our portfolio in coming quarters. As we look ahead to the second half of 2016, the message is simple. By continuing to execute on the time-proven strategic methods that we know bring value to patients and shareholders, we're confident we'll reach our goals.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt?"

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. As Mark said, second quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, and Specialty Brands results fueled by our volume growth strategy were exceptionally robust. Net sales from continuing operations were $918 million, representing growth of 13%. As noted in the press release issued this morning, we are increasing our fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on a full year basis to a range of $8.15 to $8.50. This raises the low end of the range by $0.30 per share and the upper end by $0.20.
Second quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $535 million, representing growth of 60%, achieved through ongoing focus on driving volume across the portfolio and in part through the inclusion and positive performance of INOMAX, Therakos and the recent addition of RECOTHROM. Acthar outperformed our lower -- longer-range expectations in the quarter, with $248 million in net sales, a 9% increase. As we've said, we continue to believe that this franchise will grow at the lower end of the mid-single to low double-digit range for at least the next several quarters. We're pleased to report that INOMAX generated $116 million in net sales, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. With this continued strong performance, it's clear that the growth rate for INOMAX will be higher for fiscal 2016 on a full year basis, but we continue to believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate for INOMAX is likely to be in the mid-single-digit range. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $50 million, a 13% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 4%. As Mark noted, we're pleased to have the hemostasis portfolio integrated into our hospital business, and we continue to stand by our long-term estimate of low double-digit growth, driven substantially by the product launches late this fiscal year.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which continues to be challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw the toughest comparisons yet in the second quarter with net sales of $264 million, representing a 27% decline over prior year and anticipate similar results next quarter. While we expect comparisons to ease somewhat in the fourth quarter, we believe we're likely to see continued tough competitive market dynamics in the fiscal 2017. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging for the quarter were $102 million, a 5% decline. This reflects the anticipated return to historical performance indicated on our first quarter earnings call. 
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined as anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics drove these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. While absolute R&D spending in the quarter was up slightly over prior year, this came in below our expectations. We're focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the second half of fiscal 2016 and beyond. R&D for the quarter came in at 6.4% of net sales overall, with investment in our Specialty Brands segment higher. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined as we continued to achieve savings from restructuring. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect some additive SG&A expense related to normal business activities as well as launch costs around our 2 new hemostasis products, PreveLeak and RAPLIXA. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 15.7% compared to 20.2%. We expect some upward pressure on this percentage in the second half of the fiscal year due primarily to business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $186 million. We also repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock in the quarter, returning $225 million of cash to shareholders. Overall liquidity and leverage remain very manageable. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $341 million, despite the outlays for the hemostasis acquisition and the aggressive share repurchases. Our net debt leverage ratio was a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. We continue to focus on free cash flow, combining excellent cash conversion from earnings with a vigilant eye on working capital management, and we expect our strong free cash flow to continue throughout 2016 and beyond.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

We will have that affecting us in our fiscal fourth quarter, the September quarter of this year, and that will give us 14 weeks of revenues and earnings that quarter versus our typical 13-week quarter.

In terms of the go-forward growth rate, again, we believe that this product will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range kind of on the lower end for the next couple of quarters, and the rationale for that is pretty straightforward. I mean, we were very pleased to announce today that we've continued to sign payer contracts to procure and secure longer-term access for Acthar within the managed care environment. Clearly, that has downward pressure on pricing for us. And again, while we feel very comfortable that Acthar will continue to grow in that mid-single to low double-digit range because of this dynamic, we would expect it'll be towards the lower end of that range near term. We do expect longer term for the growth rate to accelerate over time.

So look -- and when we look at our overall portfolio, we are very pleased that we have a diversified portfolio. If you keep in mind, we have 3 platforms now, each of which are roughly $1 billion or more in revenue. And we like that diversification. The Generics business for us, specifically, is a bit over $1 billion in annualized revenue. It generates great cash flow for us and clearly provides a lot of benefits to patients for the generic products that we supply in the markets in which we compete. There's no doubt that this is a challenging and very competitive market at the moment. The dynamics are such where we're seeing a lot more competition. We just saw some statistics recently where the rate of ANDA approvals through the FDA is accelerating, so there's certainly been more competition in our space and across the Generics space. We're also seeing some consolidation, certainly, on the customer sides of things, which are driving prices down. And again, I think we've seen some of our competitors in the space deliver some challenging results in the last couple of quarters. However, at the end of the day, this is a tremendous cash flow generating business for us, and we use that cash flow very effectively to build out our portfolio. We build out our portfolio in Specialty Brands by harvesting and leveraging the cash that's generated from generics. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to acquire assets to further diversify our portfolio. Longer term, the Generics business, for us, is one that we want to have as a steady growth business. And so therefore, it may make sense for us to consider looking at alternatives to build out that business as well, and that's likely to come through acquisition and that would largely be augmenting our portfolio of both commercial products as well as developmental opportunities."

We didn't do much in the second quarter, and that's because the spreads tightened pretty significantly.

But as it relates to the broader controlled substance business, for oxycodone, hydrocodone and so on, price is where we're getting a lot of pressure. Price was down, for sure, for total Mallinckrodt in the second quarter. Fortuitously for us, we're able to offset that with volume, particularly in our Specialty Brands business, as Mark mentioned earlier. As it relates to supplementing the portfolio, I'd say we're agnostic to the therapeutic areas, but we're interested in products that have a limited amount of competitive intensity. So we intentionally call our segment Specialty Generics because we don't want to compete in broad generic businesses. We like more niche areas in the Specialty Generics space.

And that's been very true in the pulmonology space where there's been an emerging body of evidence to come out here in recent months around Acthar's use in sarcoidosis, where there are very few alternatives for patients. We've also seen a continued strength across the rheumatology portfolio, but clearly, the lupus data is starting to gain some traction with many physicians. And again, we will be reporting on the open-label extension on the lupus trial that we reported on a little bit earlier. That open-label extension, we expect, will be able to report out that data towards the second half of this year. But again, we continue to invest in a variety of different data sets for Acthar, and those are the types of pieces of evidence that are helping us have appropriate conversations with physicians and with payers about the appropriate positioning for Acthar across the portfolio. But we've also seen certainly a bit of a resurgence in the use of Acthar for infantile spasms. We've refocused some of our activities into child neurology. Keep in mind, Acthar has very, very strong data for the -- for use in infantile spasms. Again, this is a tremendously devastating disease for patients. And so we've seen now a steady uptick in the growth and market share for infantile spasms as a result of our reemphasis on that particular specialty and that particular indication."

So in this market environment, if someone were to offer us a great premium for any asset in the portfolio, we would certainly take a look at it. We are very focused on our leverage ratio. Obviously, our preference if someone were to buy pieces of the portfolio, we would want to get cash for those assets, so that we could continue to navigate our balance sheet. This being said, we feel that our balance sheet is very manageable at this point."

It's predominantly volume, and we would expect it to be volume going forward. Price is increasingly less of a dynamic for Acthar on a go-forward basis. And certainly, in this quarter, the bulk of the growth on Acthar, the 9% growth that we demonstrated in this quarter was volume-related. With regards to the hub, again, this is kind of a continuous improvement type project. So we will probably never be done with the hub. We're always looking to continually improve our efficiency in that particular aspect of our distribution chain. Keep in mind though that even if we were completely 100% perfect in the hub, which is our objective over time, that this is not necessarily a significant driver of Acthar volume. What really drives Acthar volume, frankly, are our market access activities that we've done -- that we continue to report on. It's the generation of new data, which, again, we continue to make significant progress around, and it's our commercial and medical affairs activities that are really going to drive the volume growth for Acthar over time. In terms of number of patients on Acthar, again, we're in that range of 10,000 to 11,000 patients or so in any given year on Acthar. And again, our objective is to create more access for Acthar longer term to drive that 3% to 4% patient penetration rate that we have certainly to something significantly higher than that over time. And the 2 levers to do that are securing access in managed care and generating new data, and that's our primary strategy for Acthar over the long term. I'll ask Matt then to discuss a bit about the gross margin."

I would encourage you to go back and reflect on what we said on February 3, where we did say our gross profit, gross margin was going to be light. And principally, what was driving that comment back on February 3 and what you see today is what has happened in the Specialty Generics business, which is in line with what we were thinking back then and line with what we're thinking back in October. And going forward, you certainly will see continued pressure on this line. I would say, if you look at the earnings per share beat, if you will, from this morning, we continue to get great efficacy out of our restructuring. So our SG&A is probably better than external estimates. I was happy to see that. This being said, we do have some investments we need to do in the back half of the year, and then our share repurchases certainly also helped us from an earnings per share perspective. So it's very manageable. We're going to navigate through it. But I hope that people heard us very clearly on February 3 and are not expecting it to change dramatically as we move forward from where it is today."

We've -- we just started signing contracts now less than a year ago, and it'll be in another few months where we actually see whether or not these contracts are performing or not. But clearly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for Acthar is significantly enhanced by having greater access in managed care and signing contracts and having the majority of covered lives -- covered commercial lives under contract, we believe, is a great opportunity for Acthar. And again, this opportunity is one that really just creates access, and then it's up to us to come in with the appropriate data. And that's why we're so focused on data generation. That's data generation across the spectrum of data sets, whether it's preclinical or clinical data, whether it's health economic assessments, whether it's patient registries, there's a whole variety of data modernization activities that we're undertaking. And again, that's why we have consistently described the fact that we believe that the long-term normalized growth rate for Acthar is in that mid-single to low double-digit range. We're doing a lot of the work upfront with managed care now to ensure access and then bringing the data in behind it. Yes, there are some gross-to-net reductions that are going on. And again, that's why we believe, going forward, the majority of Acthar growth in that range that we've described is likely to be predominantly, if not wholly volume-driven. And that's our objective. That's our strategy across the board. We look for opportunities where we can drive volume, where there's lots of patient penetration opportunities, and Acthar is really a classic example of that. So again, we were real pleased with the Acthar performance in the quarter, very pleased with the Acthar performance in the first half of the year. It's been a bit better and a bit stronger than we had anticipated, but we're very pleased that we're generating more data and creating more access in managed care through our contracting strategy."

So again, with regards to Acthar and having covered lives under contract, our objective is to get the majority of covered lives under contract. But you could argue that greater than 15% now, we've achieved that initial goal. But long term, we would like to get that number to significantly higher than that. What's the ultimate number is hard to predict at this point. And again, when we sign contracts, it's not about signing contracts. We could get 100% covered lives under contract, if we chose to. We want to sign contracts that are beneficial, both for the business and for the plan and give us an opportunity to generate greater access for Acthar. So again, the number certainly longer term is higher than 50%. We continue to engage very actively with managed care organizations to look for contracting opportunities. It's less than 100%, so it's somewhere between 50% and 100% is our longer-term objective. With regards to INOMAX. We are very, very pleased with the performance that we've seen with INOMAX. Again, keep in mind, historically, this is a business that had grown in the mid-single-digit range. And since we've been the owners of this asset, we've clearly accelerated that now for 3 straight quarters. This is a result of a different approach to the marketplace from a commercial perspective where we contract primarily with major accounts to provide unlimited access and that's good for patients because more patients have access to this therapy, which can be life-changing. It typically takes price off the table for many accounts because you're contracting for unlimited use. So providers don't have to choose which patients get INOMAX and which don't. And we're essentially giving accounts certainty and what their budget is. So it's a significant advantage for our business as well, and you can clearly see that we've been able to accelerate the growth rate of that business now into the low double-digit range. And for 2016, it's clear that INOMAX will grow at a rate significantly higher than the traditional mid-single-digit growth rate. In any given year, the majority of our patients -- majority of our customers are likely to be on some form of a contract. Again, the typical INOMAX model is the contract for the entire bucket of services, which includes the drug, the device, the training, all of the disposables. That's the type of model that we've established that it seems to be very appealing and very successful to the majority of our customers."

And again, that's been the primary driver in the first couple of quarters of this double-digit growth. Longer term, again, we would expect this business to be in that mid-single-digit range that it's been historically, simply because of the fact that the number of -- the patient opportunity, if you will, would kind of continue to grow at the rate of population growth. So again, we've changed the dynamics here in 2016. We've given it a lift. But we would expect longer term for that business to return to more historical growth rates. And again, we're seeing the same type of dynamic with Therakos. First couple of quarters have clearly been a bit above what the historical growth rates have been, but we would expect the dynamics to return back to what they've been historically, again just based on patient opportunities and patient population. In terms of OFIRMEV, your second question, again, real pleased with OFIRMEV that we were able to demonstrate year-on-year growth.

Again, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the terlipressin registration trial. We have a single Phase III protocol where we've established an SPA with the FDA. We've recently come to an agreement on that protocol. So both the company and the FDA are in complete agreement as to how the protocol will be structured, and we'll be starting that trial in the second half of this fiscal year. Terlipressin is a very interesting product for us. It's an orphan drug, but it's used outside the U.S. as standard of care for patients that have a very devastating condition called Hepato-Renal Syndrome Type 1. Life expectancy for patients that get diagnosed with this condition can be measured in weeks. This product is not available in the U.S., and it's one that we think fits very squarely within our strategic objectives and would be a very important hospital product for us. So this will take several years for us to develop this protocol, but we believe the opportunity is very attractive and very consistent with what we're trying to do strategically."

I would say crystal balls tend to get less robust the longer you're figuring out the long term. And so I would say, Doug, to your question, the dynamics in Specialty Generics have changed, and they've gotten a bit tougher. And that's why we put in our prepared remarks that we expect this pressure to continue into '17. I'd say from how it's unfolded for the first half of the year and how we're thinking about the back half of the year, it's in keeping with where our thinking was late last year. And we started the discussion around the challenges in the Specialty Generics business in May of last year on our earnings call. Actually, we're at the anniversary of it. We highlighted it again in August, and so we've been talking about this for some time. And I'd say the near term from where we were in May and where we were in August is playing out in line with expectations. But I'd say, as we get into '17, it looks to be tough. I'd say the principal or the bigger challenge has been the amount of approvals that have been coming through for new ANDAs. Downstream consolidation has certainly occurred, but I'd say the competitive marketplace has gotten tougher, and that's where the lion's share of that pressure is coming from."

In fact, the strength of some of our other branded businesses, particularly INOMAX and Therakos, growing as fast as they are, very good margin businesses, certainly helps us in that objective. But longer term, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we want to continue to diversify our business around the 3 platforms that we have.

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another very strong quarter, driven by outstanding performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio and a more moderate decline than we expected for Specialty Generics. Our excellent performance reflects an ongoing focus on execution, especially in our Specialty Brands commercial and scientific organizations as we continue to generate compelling new data and clinical evidence for key brands and where to bring this data to new physicians and patients, clear evidence that our acquire to invest strategy is creating performance momentum. 
Net sales were up 11% for the third quarter, led by steady volume increases across the Specialty Brands segment which, as a whole, was up 32%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 9% for the quarter. This volume-based performance in Specialty Brands continues the trend established over the past several quarters, and looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to drive volume growth in this segment. Our strong showing here clearly demonstrates that we are executing against our strategy by investing in our Specialty Brands to create near and long-term value for patients and shareholders. 
In Specialty Generics, the decline in the quarter was somewhat less steep than we had anticipated, and this segment continues to generate solid cash flow. But while this quarter's performance was more positive, our expectations remain consistent with those we described a year ago and we foresee pressure on this segment for at least the next several quarters. Our focus on execution across the business is contributing to our progress as we continue to make strategic investments to build our brand assets and grow volumes in areas of high unmet medical need. Let me illustrate that further. 
We're building on the growing body of evidence for our products by generating new clinical and health economic data. In the quarter, we had approximately 40 data presentations and publications including nearly 20 for Acthar and more than a dozen for INOMAX, bringing our overall year-to-date total to roughly 80 publications and presentations. More than 1/4 of these have focused on quantifying health economic outcomes, and we anticipate this overall level of data generation to continue. Perhaps, most importantly, in fiscal 2016, we've initiated 6 company-sponsored randomized controlled clinical trials for our products and in coming quarters expect to initiate several additional new studies including a number for Acthar. I'll provide a bit more detail on some of our R&D programs in just a moment. 
Now let me turn to Specialty Brands and give you some additional perspective on our performance. As in previous periods, publications of new data, combined with commercial and medical affairs focus, contributed to another other strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up 11% in the period, driven entirely by volume. This volume growth was propelled by solid demand, increased contracting and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis as well as more mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome. 
We're particularly encouraged that our efforts are beginning to reach a whole new generation of physicians, providing them strong data on the benefits of this tried-and-true medication to treat patients suffering from complex and often devastating conditions such as infantile spasms and lupus. In infantile spasms, renewed focus has resulted in substantial share growth, improving reach to this fragile patient population. In the past several months, we believe recently published data on Acthar used in lupus patients has continued to help a new cohort of physicians better understand the value Acthar can provide to appropriate patients afflicted with this devastating disease. We're also seeing strong ongoing adoption in other indications as well, particularly steady increases in pulmonology prescribing as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. 
In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second-largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales of 24% [ph] on a pro forma basis, reflecting both a favorable contracting cycle and an increase in demand. Utilization of nitric oxide has also been supported by treatment guidelines recently published jointly by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society. While we believe this business is likely to see near-term growth rates higher than historical norms, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates longer term. 
I'm happy to report we achieved 14% revenue growth for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result of commercial execution bolstered by recent presentations of health economic data and a growing acceptance of the benefits multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system. We remain confident the growth for OFIRMEV will continue, allowing us to further expand patient reach. 
We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Therakos, with net sales growth of 16% on a pro forma basis and are especially pleased that this performance is the results of increased demand and significant growth across multiple geographies. Since acquiring the business nearly a year ago, we advanced the service component of Therakos to better align with that of INOMAX, and we're evaluating various commercial models to reach the best value proposition for customers and expand patient access. Longer term, we expect Therakos growth to settle more in the historical high single-digit range. 
Closing out Specialty Brands, we recently begun the launch cycle for PreveLeak, expanding our U.S. Hemostasis portfolio and remain on track to launch RAPLIXA later this year. As we said previously, this portfolio is expected to see double-digit growth longer term over its 2016 base of $40 million to $45 million, largely driven by the planned launches of these new products. 
Turning to Specialty Generics. Net sales were down 14% versus last year's historical high. Despite these results, this business generates valuable cash flow and provides benefits to patients and the health care system with safe cost-effective medicines. Many factors are contributing to the market volatility in this sector, and we still expect the business to face significant headwinds for at least the next several quarters. 
Providing some additional detail on science and technology, we continue to invest heavily in programs to support key in line and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, and in the quarter, announced the first patient enrolled in our company-sponsored trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome called FSGS, the largest trial yet undertaken for this condition. In other areas of the portfolio, we completed preparations for the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, began recruiting patients and saw the first patient treated last month. 
We completed our company-sponsored controlled pharmacokinetic study evaluating the interaction profile of OFIRMEV given with IV morphine compared to oral acetaminophen given with IV morphine, and we expect to report the data in coming months. And we're pleased to report the first patient has entered our company-sponsored Phase IV study comparing OFIRMEV with oral acetaminophen in total knee replacement. Recruitment in the study is ongoing. As announced, we submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA for the study of Synacthen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and continue to drive developments of this product. 
And finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is proceeding to plan. On a the development front, we continue to be very active in optimizing our commercial and development portfolio. Key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands' growth platforms as well as the Specialty Generics business. We're assessing attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and developmental, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our proven strategy to bring value to patients and shareholders.

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. You've seen that third quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales from continuing operations were $971 million, representing growth of 11%. Third quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $589 million, representing growth of 32%, reflecting especially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter with $298 million in net sales, an 11% increase. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $121 million in net sales, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis. This was exceptional for INOMAX, and we believe the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term, but we also anticipate that longer range, INOMAX performance will be closer to historical growth levels in the mid-single digits. 
Turning to OFIRMEV. We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 14%. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $53 million, a 16% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter, though challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $263 million, representing a 14% decline over prior year. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging were $104 million, a 5% decline. Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly less than anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics continued to drive these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. We're very pleased to report R&D spending in the quarter was up over prior year at 7.8% of net sales overall. We continue to be focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and beyond. In the third quarter, investment in our Specialty Brands segment was well above that spend level, with particular focus on Acthar. Adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18.6% compared to 16.8% affected primarily by business mix. 
In transitioning from a Specialty Generics and Imaging business to one dominated by Specialty Brands, Mallinckrodt has undergone significant organizational change in the last 3 years, and we expect this transformation to continue and even accelerate near term, though it will eventually level off. Accordingly, our original 3-year restructuring program was completed in the fiscal third quarter, and our board has authorized new restructuring in the amount of $100 million to $125 million to continue to refine our cost structure. 
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $412 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $861 million. Given the strong cash position in the quarter, we elected to pay $150 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At the same time we returned $100 million in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total shares repurchased under our authorized program in the past 4 quarters to $675 million or 9.9 million shares, 8.3% of total fully diluted shares outstanding. Despite these actions, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $522 million and very manageable liquidity and leverage, with the net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.5, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Notably, in July, we utilized cash to pay off the remaining balance of $250 million on our revolving credit facility. We will continue this focus on working capital management, and while not anticipated at the levels achieved in the third quarter, we expect continued strong free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2016 and beyond. A robust cash position continues to provide us significant flexibility as we consider additional business development opportunities. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole who will take us into Q&A."

That happens through this combination of efforts, and for a variety of our products, we focused on generating new data. Some of that data is in the form of clinical studies. Some of that data is in the form of health economics studies but there are many other forms of data. It's that combination of data generation with the commercial activities that we believe is driving the execution across the board.

And again, our strategy around Acthar and driving growth opportunities for Acthar I think has been quite clear since and the beginning. We said from the very beginning that our belief with this product is, one, that it's a very durable asset. It's a very durable asset that also has relatively low patient penetration. Those 2 things combined enabled us to start to invest in that product, and we have been investing significantly in data generation activities around Acthar, and our belief is that we can drive long-term volume growth and greater patient penetration through a combination of market access activities as well as data generation. The way we think about it is market access kind of gives us the opportunity to drive data into new patients -- or sorry, new physicians and new patients and we're seeing that type of momentum being created. So if we think about our objective, our objective in managed care was to ensure that we had open access to the indication set that we have for Acthar, which is extensive, as you know, with 19 separate indications, and our focus in managed care was and continues to be ensuring that we have this open access. So the approach there has been to contract our covered lives, particularly in the commercial sector. And our stated objective was to ensure that Acthar was under some form of a contract for open access in the majority of covered commercial lives. And when we started that proposition, when we acquired the product in 2014, Acthar was covered under contract by -- the proportion of covered lives under contract for Acthar was essentially 0. So over the course of the last 2 years or so, we have moved that from 0 to now greater than 50%, and we've reported a couple of times on the progress that we've made. And so we've been able to get the commercialized contract -- the commercialized under contract through, I believe, some very attractive approaches in the managed care arena. Our objective longer term would be to continue to drive even greater access. We don't anticipate that we'll ever get to 100%, but we want to continue to ensure that Acthar has long-term access in managed care because as we generate more data, it gives us a greater opportunity to further drive that product's volume growth longer term."

I would start by saying we're nowhere near out of the woods yet in the Specialty Generics business, and that's why we were cautious in our comments. What we're seeing, though, obviously, is that the Specialty Brands business performance has been so strong that it has been able to mitigate the impact of Specialty Generics. I would also highlight that the Specialty Generics segment is 27% of the revenue of Mallinckrodt. So and coming out of the gates, kind of going back to David [indiscernible] question earlier, it was nearly 50% of spend. And so one of the ways we've been able to mute the risks and the challenges in the Specialty Generics business is the robust growth and the additions that we made to the portfolio in Specialty Brands. So generally, what I would say is we were pleased with the performance in this quarter, but I would say really the weakness in the Generics business is likely to be similar to what we expected earlier in the year. And this recent strength is really just going to be pushed out, and so we do for see more challenges. But again, with it now being 27% of the revenue, that enabled us to increase guidance this morning as well because we're able to mitigate that risk."

I think we've continued to diversify our portfolio. If you look at our hospital business now, for example, you have a business that now is comprised of roughly 6 different brands, and that total portfolio of products is about $1 billion. So if you look at our overall portfolio, we're roughly $1 billion of Acthar, $1 billion of hospital, $1 billion of generics and a few other things. So we actually think we have a quite diversified portfolio. And again, we're quite pleased with the growth that we're seeing in the hospital business between OFIRMEV, the outstanding performance of INOMAX, the strong performance of Therakos. These products are growing in the double-digit range across the board, and so we're quite pleased with the diversification of that portfolio. And then in addition now, we're launching additional products and we've got a late-stage development asset in terlipressin which will also add to this portfolio over time. And so we think the diversification of our portfolio is actually quite strong now, but we're not done and we want to continue to enhance, develop, deepen our portfolio, both commercial assets as well as developmental assets, and we'll continue to do that through business development. If you look at our business in autoimmune and rare diseases, which today is primarily Acthar, we really have a presence commercial and scientific presence now in at least 4 or 5 different therapeutic areas. Our objective long term would be to build diversified businesses around those therapeutic areas and then continue to further expand our platform in the hospital, which is really a channel strategy and it enables us to bring in a variety of different unique assets, all of which serve the hospitalized patients. So we like the strategy that we set up. We believe we have 2 very scalable platforms in ARD and hospital. We believe there are some very, very attractive assets out there both commercial as well as developmental assets, and we want to continue to use our strong cash flow that you saw demonstrated in this quarter to go out and acquire those assets to diversify ourselves so that we have a well-diversified portfolio, even more so than today on both commercial and developmental assets. Our long-term objective for this business is to have a well-diversified portfolio that can grow organically in the mid-single digits, and we believe we're well on our way to achieving that objective."

Keep in mind, that this a business when we bought it a little over a year ago that had been growing in the mid-single-digit range for a number of years. And we're very pleased that we've been able to fairly dramatically accelerate that growth rate over the last several quarters and we think that's a combination of effects. One is that we've clearly been able to contract effectively 2 -- we're clearly seeing additional demand. And as you may recall, in our primary indication for INOMAX, which is for neonates in the NICU, we believe we had about a 50% patient penetration rate. And we believe as a result of our contracting strategy, we're able to significantly now enhance that penetration rate, and that's certainly leading to some of the volume increases that we're seeing. We believe, again, this is a very durable asset. We've got intellectual property and patent protection for this asset both on the drug side as well as the device side that go out well into the late 2020s and into the 2030s. And you may have noticed that we actually just posted 3 additional new patents around this particular asset. We're also very pleased that we prevailed in the kind of the first round of the IPR activities, particularly on 4 out of the 5 drug patents. And keep in mind, in order to keep our exclusivity out into the late 2020s around the drug side, we only need to prevail on one of the claims in one of the patents, and there are multiple claims across multiple patents. So we feel quite strongly about this and we'll continue to generate more intellectual property and patent estate, as you've just seen us do, as we go forward. So again, we think it's a very, very durable asset. In terms of a generic entry coming in, we think that's a highly unlikely proposition, certainly not before the late 2020s at this point."

Again, 16% growth in the quarter, significantly higher than the historical growth rate than we had seen with this product before we've acquired it roughly a year ago. Our hypothesis was that we could use some of the elements of the INOMAX approach and apply those to Therakos. And certainly, on the service side, the back office side, we've already done that integration, and we believe that some of the enhanced growth that we're seeing in Therakos is the result of some of those synergies that we've been able to capture from the INOMAX model. We think there are also opportunities longer term for us to look at other commercial ways that we can further provide greater patient access to Therakos therapy. By looking at the INOMAX model, although recognizing that the sales organizations are separate, given the sales approach in INOMAX is really into the neonatal population and in the Therakos cases a bit more into the adult population. We believe that the opportunities are significantly -- significant in CTCL for the simple reason that patient penetration rates there for appropriate patients are only in the order of about 10% to 15%, and we believe that the growth opportunities is primarily in that space near term. Obviously, we are also conducting additional work for Therakos to further expand the label and our study in pediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we would expect, assuming that, that trial is positive, that, that could potentially lead to an expansion in the Therakos label, which again would give us greater volume growth opportunities longer term."

So the way the back office piece of it works is very simple in the sense that these are both INOMAX and Therakos are drug device combinations which adds to their exclusivity, if you will, and durability as assets. And as such, there's a certain amount of training and a certain amount of service that goes along with any kind of a device drug combination, and that approach was finally honed in the INOMAX case. And so we've used that service and training approach with Therakos, a capability that wasn't quite as well developed. And again, we're seeing that benefit, we think, in the access to the accounts as a result of that streamlined sales and service model -- or primarily service and training model that we have from the INOMAX side. In terms of acute graft-versus-host disease, this is a study that will weed out probably in the next 2 to 3 years. So again, this is a longer-term opportunity for Therakos, and we believe that near term, there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive patient penetration and volume in CTCL."

We're in the process right now, as you know, of essentially wrapping up some of the trials that had been initiated under previous ownership. But we're also dramatically and significantly increasing our investment across the board in Acthar data generation including a number of clinical trials. As you saw each quarter, we've been reporting on the number of data sets that read out. A lot of the data that we've been generating that's new, if you will, is on the health economics side because, as you might imagine, there's a wealth of data available in the marketplace for this product that just needs to be analyzed, quantified and presented. And so we'll focus near term on using that information and bringing it to the marketplace. And we believe that's certainly having an impact on a variety of different physicians and managed care organizations as we really now quantify the pretty significant data set that currently exist for Acthar. On the clinical side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've initiated 6 clinical trials this year. We plan to initiate several more. That's across our branded portfolio and several of these will be in the Acthar arena. We already gave you some insight into the fact that we're going to be doing another trial in lupus significantly larger than we had done initially or had been done initially which we would consider to be a pilot trial, and we were very pleased with the outcome of that pilot trial which gives us very good confidence to go ahead and invest further in lupus. But there are other areas in the Acthar label that we believe could give us significant opportunities through additional controlled clinical trials. And as we finalize the details of those trials, we'll be reporting on those. But those trials are now just initiating and so they will typically take a couple of years before they read out. The way I think about this, though, is much like we did in the lupus arena, we want to focus on the controlled clinical data, particularly that of which is either active control or placebo-controlled inpatient subpopulations like we did in the lupus arena, which is particularly standard way that one would go about generating clinical data for indications that you already have on label. Again, our focus will be primarily on generating data for on-label indications. And we will continue to look for other opportunities to drive Acthar growth through data generation in the coming years."

Infantile spasms, for example, we're seeing significant growth in market share as we refocus the neurology sales force into this area, and that's certainly a significant benefit for patients. And as you know, we have very, very strong data for Acthar's use in infantile spasms. We're seeing a lot of growth in the rheumatology arena again across the board. And we believe, based on market resurge, that the lupus data up that was presented in 2 tranches for Acthar, both the controlled phase as well as the open-label phase, is starting to open up to a whole new cohort of physicians, a further opportunity for those physicians to provide benefit to their lupus patients. We're seeing significant growth in the area of sarcoidosis as data was presented earlier this year which shows Acthar's utility in that space where there are really very, very few options for these very, very sick patients. So across pulmonology, rheumatology, certainly in infantile spasms, these are the areas that are continuing to drive growth. In terms of sales force, I think that we have a significant and appropriately sized sales organization. Keep in mind that each one of our sales forces really focused primarily on a given therapeutic area, which means that each one of these sales forces is highly specialized. And I think while of the sales force certainly is having an impact, it's really the intersection of the activities that we're generating between market access, the sales organization and then really the generation of significant additional data, particularly on the health economics side, which, together, these 3 things I believe are really starting to open up a whole new group of physicians and their interest in Acthar and the prescribing and the volume that we're seeing as a result of the combination of factors."

Or do you feel like the growth of the assets that you've already acquired in the past couple of years are doing great and it's more important to buy an asset that's in the pipeline versus commercialized assets? And how does your priorities match up with what you're seeing out there?"

So I would say that our objective is to enhance the portfolio, further diversify it both on the commercial side as well as the development side with our objective, again, being -- having a well-diversified portfolio that can grow organically over time in that mid-single-digit range. So all else being equal, we would be quite interested in enhancing our Specialty Brands portfolio, whether it's in the ARD arena or in the hospital arena, and we like both commercialized assets, but we have a significant need to further enhance our development portfolio. And so we're happy to bring in assets that do both of those things or either of those things and an asset like we did with the Ikaria acquisition, for example, is a very good one. We bring in a great commercialized assets in INOMAX and a late-stage development asset in terlipressin. So we would love to do those types of acquisitions. And we see plenty of opportunities out there that are both accessible and will make very good strategic sense in the areas of focus that we have, which is hospital and ARD. On the Specialty Generics aside, we're certainly very opportunistic there as well, and I think in particular, being able to further enhance the stable of ANDAs that we have in our portfolio would make very good sense. So again, across our portfolio, with some primary focus on the Specialty Brands side and more opportunistic focus on the Generics side, we're quite happy to bring in both commercial and developmental assets."

As we said quite clearly, we expect that INOMAX growth in the near term will be higher than it has been historically, but longer term, it's probably going to migrate closer to what it has been historically in the mid-single-digit range. We believe that the enhanced growth for INOMAX, and keep in mind, we've been growing INOMAX since we acquired it at multiples over the historical growth rate, we think that has to do, one, with enhanced contracting strategy. And again, this is good for the accounts, it's good for the business, and it's good for the patients. And our contracting strategy is pretty straightforward in that we offer INOMAX in an unlimited use fashion, which then enables physicians, particularly in the NICU, not to have to make a choice between a patient that's very sick and another one that's not quite as sick in terms of whether they get INOMAX or not. And we believe that is likely to drive additional patient penetration in appropriate patients in the NICU. We also, we believe, have benefited a bit from the guidelines about the use of nitric oxide that were recently published in the last year or so jointly by the American Heart Association -- or American Hospital Association and the American Thoracic Society which advocate the use of nitric oxide earlier in patients to provide additional benefit. So we believe that it's the combination of those factors plus a significantly enhanced set of commercial activities that we've been driving to take advantage of the contracting strategy that are leading to this enhanced performance. Again, longer term, we would expect that because we've been benefiting up front from significant contracting activities that, that's going to level out over time, which is why we're projecting that the growth rates is likely to settle in longer term to that historical growth rate. So again, very pleased with INOMAX, very pleased with the things that we've been able to do with it in the last year or so to enhance the growth rate and we'll continue to invest in this product to provide benefit for more patients."

As you know, Anthony, particularly when we brought Acthar into the portfolio, we were able to get our net debt leverage down pretty significantly in a quick period. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that we've focused on buying assets that had good LTMs and had very strong cash flow. As you saw in the release this morning, we are at 3.5 from a net debt leverage perspective. The difference between here and there was back then, we were generating $150 million to $200 million in cash flow. And here we are a few years out, we're generating $1 billion, as you saw with our performance in the third quarter. It puts us in great shape to deliver on that, as I said earlier. So we haven't really given a specific number on net debt leverage, but if we take it up, we delever relatively quickly. We haven't seen any material impact from the guidelines on the business. Typically, these types of guidelines, you can see them coming for miles. And so yes, there's pressure, yes, there's downward pressure on controlled substances in this country. And so that's factored into all of our guidance and all the thinking that we provided this time last year, quite frankly, on the earnings call. As it relates to oxycodone and hydrocodone, I would say they were better than what we were expecting in this quarter, and that's why we're forecasting more challenges as we move into future quarters."

I've been pretty clear to say that we believe that there are a number of very attractive assets available in the marketplace that are accessible that we think meet our strategic and financial objectives. We don't feel constrained at all, frankly, in our ability to acquire those assets primarily because of the fantastic cash flow that we have. But as Matt said, if there's an opportunity that's out there that requires us to take on some debt, we will do that, but we will pay it down quickly. As we've done, as you've seen us do even in this quarter, we've paid down our debt dramatically. So again, we would look for things that make great financial sense, great strategic sense. And again, if our net debt leverage goes up for a bit, we want to make sure that we can delever very quickly, as Matt said. And the bottom line is we don't feel constrained at all in our ability to acquire very good assets, and we believe a number of those are out there."

While, theoretically, anything is possible and we fully would expect competition over time to Acthar, enhanced competition over time because there's a lot of competition to Acthar today, we would expect that, that type of competition, particularly in the [indiscernible] area, is likely to come through the NDA route. And if it doesn't come to an NDA route it's likely going to be a fairly complex process to get there. We continue to believe that the likelihood of a AB-rated generic Acthar is very, very low. Again, this is a product that today is a complex mixture of a variety of active naturally derived agents. It's significantly more complex than Lovenox. Lovenox is essentially a single peptide, and we believe that the opportunity as it exists today for an AB-rated generic is exceptionally low because a pathway currently doesn't exist. The active agents in Acthar are very complex, only some of which are fully characterized, and we just believe that this pathway is highly unlikely. Although anything is theoretically possible, we think this is perhaps the least likely area in the near term and perhaps in the long term for future Acthar competition."

We believe we'll be able to continue to drive volume growth for OFIRMEV going forward primarily because of the fact that this is a product that we continue to demonstrate has significant -- both clinical utility as well as has a very positive pharmacoeconomic proposition. And in the quarter and in this past year, we've consistently been posting a number of different data sets, highlighting the pharmacoeconomic benefits of Acthar -- or of OFIRMEV. So again, very pleased with the performance, and we think we can continue to drive growth. The other piece of it I think is that it clearly looks like a multimodal analgesia is the approach that many institutions are now moving towards in the management of pain associated with surgery, and OFIRMEV fits very squarely in that type of a protocol.

But I think it's a good point to remind people that because of our 4 5 4 accounting structure that we've talked about ad nauseam, in the September quarter that we're in right now, we're going to have an extra week. We've talked about that, and clearly, it means the September quarter is probably going to look pretty good on the revenue side of things. It's going to look pretty good on the margin side of things. I would note that -- and I salute the sole site out there because if you look at the cadence of estimates that are out there, it looks like you guys have already pretty much taken into account the fact that we got an extra week in September. And so it certainly shows that way when you look at the cadence of numbers throughout the year. Obviously, in the June quarter, we had very, very strong fundamentals that you just saw. In the September quarter, we've got that extra week going for us. The reason why I bring that up is, once we get into the December quarter, we should be back to a much more normal kind of run rate again. And I think it's important you take that into account when you're comparing the quantitative numbers, both the really good numbers that you saw that we announced this morning as well as the probable pretty good numbers that you're going to see in the September quarter.

This morning, we provided an adjusted diluted earnings guidance range for calendar year 2016, the 53-week period ending December 30, 2016, of $8.50 to $8.80 per share. We also noted that we now expect results from fiscal year 2016, the period ending September 30, 2016, to come in above the high end of the previously provided range of $8.15 to $8.50 per share. For the June quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.79. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings came in at $2.20 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who'll go into more detail on the third quarter results. Mark?"

And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another very strong quarter, driven by outstanding performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio and a more moderate decline than we expected for Specialty Generics. Our excellent performance reflects an ongoing focus on execution, especially in our Specialty Brands commercial and scientific organizations, as we continue to generate compelling new data and clinical evidence for key brands and work to bring this data to new physicians and patients, clear evidence that our Acquire to Invest strategy is creating performance momentum.
Net sales were up 11% for the third quarter, led by steady volume increases across the Specialty Brands segment which as a whole was up 32%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 9% for the quarter. This volume-based performance in Specialty Brands continues the trend established over the past several quarters. And looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to drive volume growth in this segment. Our strong showing here clearly demonstrates that we are executing against our strategy by investing in our specialty brands to create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders. In Specialty Generics, the decline in the quarter was somewhat less steep than we had anticipated, and this segment continues to generate solid cash flow. But while this quarter's performance was more positive, our expectations remain consistent with those we described a year ago, and we foresee pressure on this segment for at least the next several quarters.
Our focus on execution across the business is contributing to our progress as we continue to make strategic investments to build our brand assets and grow volumes in areas of high unmet medical need. Let me illustrate that further.
We're building on the growing body of evidence for our products by generating new clinical and health economic data. In the quarter, we had approximately 40 data presentations and publications, including nearly 20 for Acthar and more than a dozen for INOMAX, bringing our overall year-to-date total to roughly 80 publications and presentations. More than 1/4 of these have focused on quantifying health economic outcomes, and we anticipate this overall level of data generation to continue. Perhaps most importantly, in fiscal 2016, we have initiated 6 company-sponsored, randomized controlled clinical trials for our products; and in coming quarters expect to initiate several additional new studies, including a number for Acthar. I'll provide a bit more detail on some of our R&D programs in just a moment.
Now let me turn to Specialty Brands and give you some additional perspective on our performance. As in previous periods, publication of new data, combined with commercial and medical affairs focus, contributed to another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up 11% in the period driven entirely by volume. This volume growth was propelled by solid demand, increased contracting and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis as well as more mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome. We're particularly encouraged that our efforts are beginning to reach a whole new generation of physicians, providing them strong data on the benefits of this tried-and-true medication to treat patients suffering from complex and often devastating conditions such as infantile spasms and lupus. In infantile spasms, renewed focus has resulted in substantial share growth, improving reach to this fragile patient population. In the past several months, we believe recently published data on Acthar used in lupus patients has continued to help a new cohort of physicians better understand the value Acthar can provide to appropriate patients afflicted with this devastating disease. We're also seeing strong ongoing adoption in other indications as well, particularly steady increases in pulmonology prescribing as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 24% on a pro forma basis, reflecting both a favorable contracting cycle and an increase in demand. Utilization of nitric oxide has also been supported by treatment guidelines recently published jointly by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society. While we believe this business is likely to see near-term growth rates higher than historical norms, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates longer term.
I'm happy to report we achieved 14% revenue growth for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result of commercial execution bolstered by recent presentations of health economic data and a growing acceptance of the benefits multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system. We remain confident that growth for OFIRMEV will continue, allowing us to further expand patient reach.
We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Therakos, with net sales growth of 16% on a pro forma basis; and are especially pleased that this performance is the result of increased demand and significant growth across multiple geographies. Since acquiring the business nearly a year ago, we've advanced the service component of Therakos to better align with that of INOMAX. And we're evaluating various commercial models to reach the best value proposition for customers and expand patient access. Longer term, we expect Therakos' growth to settle more in the historical high single-digit range.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We've recently begun the launch cycle for PreveLeak, expanding our U.S. hemostasis portfolio; and remain on track to launch Raplixa later this year. As we've said previously, this portfolio is expected to see double-digit growth longer term over its 2016 base of $40 million to $45 million, largely driven by the planned launches of these new products.
Turning to Specialty Generics. Net sales were down 14% versus last year's historical high. Despite these results, this business generates valuable cash flow and provides benefits to patients and the health care system with safe, cost-effective medicines. Many factors are contributing to the market volatility in this sector, and we still expect the business to face significant headwinds for at least the next several quarters.
Providing some additional detail on science and technology. We continue to invest heavily in programs that support key in-line and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands; and in the quarter, announced the first patient enrolled in our company-sponsored trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome called FSGS, the largest trial yet undertaken for these conditions. In other areas of the portfolio, we completed preparations for the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, began recruiting patients and saw the first patient treated last month. We completed our company-sponsored controlled pharmacokinetic study evaluating the interaction profile of OFIRMEV given with IV morphine compared to oral acetaminophen given with IV morphine, and we expect to report the data in coming months. And we're pleased to report the first patient has entered our company-sponsored Phase IV study comparing OFIRMEV with oral acetaminophen in total knee replacement. Recruitment in the study is ongoing. As announced, we submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA for the study of Synacthen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and continue to drive developments of this product. And finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is proceeding to plan.
On the business development front, we continue to be very active in optimizing our commercial and development portfolio. Key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms as well as the Specialty Generics business. We're assessing attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and developmental; and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our proven strategy to bring value to patients and shareholders.

232036063,367067633,1021501,"Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Mallinckrodt PLC","Executives","Thanks, Mark.Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials.

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. You've seen that third quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales from continuing operations were $971 million, representing growth of 11%.
Third quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $589 million, representing growth of 32%, reflecting especially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter with $298 million in net sales, an 11% increase. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $121 million in net sales, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis. This was exceptional for INOMAX. And we believe the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term, but we also anticipate that, longer range, INOMAX performance will be closer to historical growth levels in the mid-single digits. Turning to OFIRMEV: We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 14%. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $53 million, a 16% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter, though challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $263 million, representing a 14% decline over prior year. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging were $104 million, a 5% decline.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly less than anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics continued to drive these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. We're very pleased to report R&D spending in the quarter was up over prior year at 7.8% of net sales overall. We continue to be focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and beyond. In the third quarter, investment in our Specialty Brands segment was well above that spend level, with particular focus on Acthar.
Adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18.6% compared to 16.8%, affected primarily by business mix.
In transitioning from a Specialty Generics and imaging business to one dominated by Specialty Brands, Mallinckrodt has undergone significant organizational change in the last 3 years. And we expect this transformation to continue and even accelerate near term, though it will eventually level off. Accordingly, our original 3-year restructuring program was completed in the fiscal third quarter, and our board has authorized new restructuring in the amount of $100 million to $125 million to continue to refine our cost structure.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $412 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $861 million. Given the strong cash position in the quarter, we elected to pay $150 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At the same time, we returned $100 million in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total shares repurchased under our authorized program in the past 4 quarters to $675 million or 9.9 million shares, 8.3% of total fully diluted shares outstanding. Despite these actions, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $522 million and very manageable liquidity and leverage, with a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.5, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Notably, in July, we utilized cash to pay off the remaining balance of $250 million on our revolving credit facility.
We will continue this focus on working capital management. And while not anticipated at the levels achieved in the third quarter, we expect continued strong free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2016 and beyond. A robust cash position continues to provide us significant flexibility as we consider additional business development opportunities.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

And if you noticed, in our prepared comments we did highlight the fact that it's this combination of factors. We've been very clear to say that we believe that we have a product portfolio that has significant volume-upside opportunities, and we're demonstrating volume-driven growth across our Specialty Brands portfolio. That happens through this combination of efforts. And for a variety of our products, we've focused on generating new data. Some of that data is in the form of clinical studies. Some of that data is in the form of health economics studies, but there are many other forms of data. It's that combination of data generation with the commercial activities that we believe is driving the execution across the board. From an organizational standpoint, we do operate our brands business in a fairly focused manner in the sense that we have an organization that focuses specifically in the hospital area and another organization that focuses specifically in the autoimmune area. That enables us to have sufficient firepower and focus on those businesses and those customers to ensure that we execute our volume-based strategy going forward."

And again, our strategy around Acthar and driving growth opportunities for Acthar, I think, has been quite clear since the beginning. We said from the very beginning that our belief with this product is, one, that it's a very durable asset. It's a very durable asset that also has relatively low patient penetration. Those 2 things combined enabled us to start to invest in that product, and we have been investing significantly in data-generation activities around Acthar. And our belief is that we can drive long-term volume growth and greater patient penetration through a combination of market access activities as well as data generation. The way we think about it is market access kind of gives us the opportunity to drive data into new patients -- or sorry, new physicians and new patients, and we're seeing that type of momentum being created. So if we think about our objective, our objective in managed care was to ensure that we had open access to the indication set that we have for Acthar, which is extensive, as you know, with 19 separate indications. And our focus in managed care was and continues to be ensuring that we have this open access, so the approach there has been to contract for covered lives, particularly in the commercial sector. And our stated objective was to ensure that Acthar was under some form of a contract for open access in the majority of covered commercial lives. And when we started that proposition, when we acquired the product in 2014, Acthar was covered under contract by -- the proportion of covered lives under contract for Acthar was essentially 0, so over the course of the last 2 years or so, we have moved that from 0 to now greater than 50%. And we have reported a couple of times on the progress that we've made. And so we've been able to get the commercial lives contract that we -- commercial lives under contract through, I believe, some very attractive approaches in the managed care arena. Our objective longer term would be to continue to drive even greater access. We don't anticipate that we'll ever get to 100%, but we want to continue to ensure that Acthar has long-term access in managed care because, as we generate more data, it gives us a greater opportunity to further drive that product's volume growth longer term."

What we're seeing, though, obviously is that the Specialty Brands business performance has been so strong that it has been able to mitigate the impact of Specialty Generics. I would also highlight that the Specialty Generics segment is 27% of the revenue of Mallinckrodt, so -- and coming out of the gates, kind of going back to David Maris' question earlier, it was nearly 50% of spend. And so one of the ways we've been able to mute the risks and the challenges in the Specialty Generics business is the robust growth and the additions that we've made to the portfolio in Specialty Brands. So generally, what I would say is we were pleased with the performance in this quarter, but I would say really the weakness in the generics business is likely to be similar to what we expected earlier in the year. And this recent strength is really just going to be pushed out, and so we do foresee more challenges. But again, with it now being 27% of the revenue, that enabled us to increase guidance this morning as well because we're able to mitigate that risk."

If you look at our hospital business now, for example, you have a business that now is comprised of roughly 6 different brands, and that total portfolio of products is about $1 billion.

And again, we're quite pleased with the growth that we're seeing in that hospital business between OFIRMEV, the outstanding performance of INOMAX, the strong performance of Therakos. These products are growing in the double-digit range across the board, and so we're quite pleased with the diversification in that portfolio.

Our objective long term would be to build diversified businesses around those therapeutic areas and then continue to further expand our platform in the hospital, which is really a channel strategy. And it enables us to bring in a variety of different unique assets, all of which serve the hospitalized patients. So we like the strategy that we've set up. We believe we have 2 very scalable platforms in ARD and hospital. We believe there are some very, very attractive assets out there, both commercial as well as developmental assets.

Keep in mind that this was business, when we bought it a little over a year ago, that had been growing in the mid-single-digit range for a number of years. And we're very pleased that we've been able to fairly dramatically accelerate that growth rate over the last several quarters, and we think that's a combination of effects. One is that we've clearly been able to contract effectively. Two, we're clearly seeing additional demand. And as you may recall, in our primary indication for INOMAX, which is for neonates in the NICU, we believe we had about a 50% patient penetration rate. And we believe, as a result of our contracting strategy, we're able to significantly now enhance that penetration rate, and that's certainly leading to some of the volume increases that we're seeing. We believe, again, this is a very durable asset. We've got intellectual property and patent protection for this asset both on the drug side as well as the device side that go out well into the late 2020s and into the 2030s. And you may have noticed that we actually just posted 3 additional new patents around this particular asset. We were also very pleased that we prevailed in the kind of the first round of the IPR activities, particularly on 4 out of the 5 drug patents. And keep in mind, in order to keep our exclusivity out into the late 2020s around the drug side, we only need to prevail on one of the claims in 1 of the patents. And there are multiple claims across multiple patents, so we feel quite strongly about this. And we'll continue to generate more intellectual property and patent estate, as you've just seen us do, as we go forward. So again, we think it's a very, very durable asset. In terms of a generic entry coming in, we think that's a highly unlikely proposition, certainly not before the late 2020s, at this point."

Again, 16% growth in the quarter, significantly higher than the historical growth rate that we had seen with this product before we've acquired it roughly a year ago. Our hypothesis was that we could use some of the elements of the INOMAX approach and apply those to Therakos. And certainly, on the service side, the back-office side, we've already done that integration. And we believe that some of the enhanced growth that we're seeing in Therakos is the result of some of those synergies that we've been able to capture from the INOMAX model. We think there are also opportunities longer term for us to look at other commercial ways that we can further provide greater patient access to Therakos therapy by looking at the INOMAX model, although recognizing that the sales organizations are separate given that the sales approach in INOMAX is really into the neonatal population and in the Therakos case it's a bit more into the adult population. We believe that the opportunities are significantly -- significant in CTCL for the simple reason that patient penetration rates there for appropriate patients are only on the order of about 10% to 15%. And we believe that the growth opportunities is primarily in that space near term. Obviously, we are also conducting additional work for Therakos to further expand the label. And our study in pediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we would expect, assuming that, that trial is positive, that, that could potentially lead to an expansion in the Therakos label, which again would give us greater volume growth opportunities longer term."

And as such, there is a certain amount of training and a certain amount of service that goes along with any kind of a device-drug combination, and that approach was finally honed in the INOMAX case. And so we've used that service and training approach with Therakos, a capability that wasn't quite as well developed. And again, we're seeing that benefit, we think, in the access to the accounts as a result of that streamlined sales and service model -- or primarily service and training model that we have from the INOMAX side. In terms of acute graft-versus-host disease, this is a study that will read out probably in the next 2 to 3 years. So again, this is a longer-term opportunity for Therakos. And we believe that near term there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive patient penetration and volume in CTCL."

And again, given the durability of this asset, we believe the investments on the clinical side are very important and are likely to continue to drive Acthar volume long term. We're in the process right now, as you know, of essentially wrapping up some of the trials that had been initiated under previous ownership, but we're also dramatically and significantly increasing our investment across-the-board in Acthar data generation, including a number of clinical trials. As you saw, each quarter, we've been reporting on the number of data sets that read out. A lot of the data that we've been generating that's new, if you will, is on the health economics side because, as you might imagine, there is a wealth of data available in the marketplace for this product that just needs to be analyzed, quantified and presented. And so we will focus near term on using that information and bringing it to the marketplace. And we believe that's certainly having an impact on a variety of different physicians and managed care organizations, as we really now quantify that -- the pretty significant data set that currently exists for Acthar. On the clinical side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've initiated 6 clinical trials this year. We plan to initiate several more. That's across our branded portfolio, and several of these will be in the Acthar arena. We already gave you some insight into the fact that we're going to be doing another trial in lupus significantly larger than we had done initially or had been done initially which we would consider to be a pilot trial. And we were very pleased with the outcome of that pilot trial, which gives us very good confidence to go ahead and invest further in lupus, but there are other areas in the Acthar label that we believe could give us significant opportunities through additional controlled clinical trials. And as we finalize the details of those trials, we'll be reporting on those, but those trials are now just initiating. And so they will typically take a couple of years before they read out. The way I'd think about this, though, is much like we did in the lupus arena, we want to focus the controlled clinical data, particularly that's -- that of which is either active control or placebo control, in patient subpopulations, like we did in the lupus arena, which is a particularly standard way that one would go about generating clinical data for indications that you already have on label. Again, our focus will be primarily on generating data for on-label indications, and we will continue to look for other opportunities to drive Acthar growth through data generation in the coming years."

Infantile spasms, for example, we're seeing significant growth in market share as we refocus the neurology sales force into this area. And that's certainly a significant benefit for patients. And as you know, we have very, very strong data for Acthar's use in infantile spasms. We're seeing a lot of growth in the rheumatology arena again across-the-board. And we believe, based on market research, that the lupus data that was presented in 2 tranches for Acthar, both the controlled phase as well as the open-label phase, is starting to open up to a whole new cohort of physicians, a further opportunity for those physicians to provide benefit to their lupus patients. We're seeing significant growth in the area of sarcoidosis, as data was presented earlier this year which shows Acthar's utility in that space where there are really very, very few options for these very, very sick patients. So across pulmonology, rheumatology, certainly in infantile spasms, these are the areas that are continuing to drive growth. In terms of sales force, I think that we have a significant and appropriately sized sales organization. Keep in mind that each one of our sales forces is really focused primarily on a given therapeutic area, which means that each one of these sales forces is highly specialized. And I think, while the sales force certainly is having an impact, it's really the intersection of the activities that we're generating between market access; the sales organization; and then really the generation of significant additional data, particularly on the health economics side, which together these 3 things, I believe, are really starting to open up a whole new group of physicians and their interest in Acthar and the prescribing and the volume that we're seeing as a result of that combination of factors."

As we said quite clearly, we expect that INOMAX growth in the nearer term will be higher than it has been historically, but longer term, it's probably going to migrate closer to what it has been historically in the mid-single-digit range. We believe that -- the enhanced growth for INOMAX, and keep in mind we have been growing INOMAX since we acquired it at multiples over the historical growth rate, we think that has to do, one, with the enhanced contracting strategy. And again, this is good for the accounts. It's good for the business, and it's good for the patients. And our contracting strategy is pretty straightforward in that we offer INOMAX in an unlimited-use fashion, which then enables physicians, particularly in the NICU, not to have to make a choice between a patient that's very sick and another one that's not quite as sick in terms of whether they get INOMAX or not. And we believe that is likely to drive additional patient penetration in appropriate patients in the NICU. We've also, we believe, have benefited a bit from the guidelines around the use of nitric oxide that were recently published in the last year or so jointly by the American heart -- or American Hospital Association and the American Thoracic Society, which advocate the use of nitric oxide earlier in patients to provide additional benefit. So we believe that it's the combination of those factors, plus a significantly enhanced set of commercial activities that we've been driving to take advantage of the contracting strategy, that are leading to this enhanced performance. Again longer term, we would expect that -- because we've been benefiting upfront from significant contracting activities, that, that's going to level out over time, which is why we're projecting that the growth rate is likely to settle in longer term to that historical growth rate. So again, very pleased with INOMAX, very pleased with the things that we've been able to do with it in the last year or so to enhance the growth rate. And we will continue to invest in this product to provide benefit for more patients."

As you know, Anthony, particularly when we brought Acthar into the portfolio, we were able to get our net debt leverage down pretty significantly in a quick period. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that we've focused on buying assets that had good LTMs and had very strong cash flow. As you saw in the release this morning, we are at 3.5 from a net debt leverage perspective. The difference between here and there was, back then, we were generating $150 million to $200 million in cash flow, and here we are. A few years out, we're generating $1 billion, as you saw with our performance in the third quarter. It puts us in great shape to deliver on that, as I said earlier. So we haven't really given a specific number on net debt leverage, but if we take it up, we delever relatively quickly. We haven't seen any material impact from the guidelines on the business. Typically, these types of guidelines, you can see them coming for miles. And so yes, there's pressure. Yes, there's downward pressure on controlled substances in this country. And so that's factored into all of our guidance and all of the thinking that we provided this time last year, quite frankly, on the earnings call. As it relates to oxycodone and hydrocodone, I would say they were better than what we were expecting in this quarter, and that's why we're forecasting more challenges as we move into future quarters."

We don't feel constrained at all, frankly, in our ability to acquire those assets primarily because of the fantastic cash flow that we have, but as Matt said, if there's an opportunity that's out there that requires us to take on some debt, we will do that but we will pay it down quickly, as we've done, as you've seen us do. Even in this quarter, we paid down our debt dramatically. So again, we would look for things that make great financial sense, great strategic sense.

While theoretically anything is possible, and we fully would expect competition over time to Acthar, enhanced competition over time because there's a lot of competition to Acthar today, we would expect that, that type of competition, particularly in the [indiscernible] area, is likely to come through the NDA route. And if it does come through an NDA route, it's likely going to be a fairly complex process to get there. We continue to believe that the likelihood of a AB-rated generic Acthar is very, very low. Again, this is a product that today is a complex mixture of a variety of active, naturally derived agents. It's significantly more complex than Lovenox [ph]. Lovenox [ph] is essentially a single peptide. And we believe that the opportunity, as it exists today, for an AB-rated generic is exceptionally low because a pathway currently doesn't exist. The active agents in Acthar are very complex, only some of which are fully characterized. And we just believe that this pathway is highly unlikely. Although anything is theoretically possible, we think this is perhaps the least likely area in the near term and perhaps in the long term for future Acthar competition."

We believe we'll be able to continue to drive volume growth for OFIRMEV going forward primarily because of the fact that this is a product that we continue to demonstrate has significant both clinical utility as well as has a very positive pharmacoeconomic proposition. And in the quarter and in this past year, we've consistently been posting a number of different data sets highlighting the pharmacoeconomic benefits of Acthar -- or of OFIRMEV. So again, very pleased with the performance and we think we can continue to drive growth. The other piece of it, I think, is that it clearly looks like a multimodal analgesia is the approach that many institutions are now moving towards in the management of pain associated with surgery, and OFIRMEV fits very squarely in that type of a protocol. So we think the factors are moving in the right direction to continue to support the volume growth of OFIRMEV going forward."

We've talked about that. And clearly, it means the September quarter is probably going to look pretty good on the revenue side of things. It's going to look pretty good on the margin side of things. I would note that -- and I salute the sell side out there because, if you look at the cadence of estimates that are out there, it looks like you guys have already pretty much taken into account the fact that we've got the extra week in September. And so it certainly shows that way when you look at the cadence of numbers throughout the year. Obviously, in the June quarter, we had very, very strong fundamentals that you just saw. In the September quarter, we've got that extra week going for us. The reason why I bring that up is, once we get into the December quarter, we should be back to a much more normal kind of a run rate again. And I think it's important you take that into account when you're comparing the quantitative numbers, both the really good numbers that you saw that we announced this morning as well as the probable pretty good numbers that you're going to see in the September quarter.

Please note we assume no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. We ask you to please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
We'll also provide some non-GAAP adjusted financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to GAAP is detailed in our earnings release and its related financial tables, which can be found on our website, mallinckrodt.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations page of our website for such information. As noted in our press release, unless otherwise specified, all comparisons of quarterly performance are to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition, the revenue growth ranges we will be discussing are on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted.
This morning, we provided an adjusted diluted earnings guidance range for calendar year 2016, the 53-week period ending December 30, 2016, of $8.50 to $8.80 per share. We also noted that we now expect results from fiscal year 2016, the period ending September 30, 2016, to come in above the high end of the previously provided range of $8.15 to $8.50 per share. For the June quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.79. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings came in at $2.20 per share.

And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another very strong quarter, driven by outstanding performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio and a more moderate decline than we expected for Specialty Generics. Our excellent performance reflects an ongoing focus on execution, especially in our Specialty Brands commercial and scientific organizations, as we continue to generate compelling new data and clinical evidence for key brands and work to bring this data to new physicians and patients, clear evidence that our Acquire to Invest strategy is creating performance momentum.
Net sales were up 11% for the third quarter, led by steady volume increases across the Specialty Brands segment which as a whole was up 32%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 9% for the quarter. This volume-based performance in Specialty Brands continues the trend established over the past several quarters. And looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to drive volume growth in this segment. Our strong showing here clearly demonstrates that we are executing against our strategy by investing in our specialty brands to create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders. In Specialty Generics, the decline in the quarter was somewhat less steep than we had anticipated, and this segment continues to generate solid cash flow. But while this quarter's performance was more positive, our expectations remain consistent with those we described a year ago, and we foresee pressure on this segment for at least the next several quarters.
Our focus on execution across the business is contributing to our progress as we continue to make strategic investments to build our brand assets and grow volumes in areas of high unmet medical need. Let me illustrate that further.
We're building on the growing body of evidence for our products by generating new clinical and health economic data. In the quarter, we had approximately 40 data presentations and publications, including nearly 20 for Acthar and more than a dozen for INOMAX, bringing our overall year-to-date total to roughly 80 publications and presentations. More than 1/4 of these have focused on quantifying health economic outcomes and we anticipate this overall level of data generation to continue. Perhaps most importantly, in fiscal 2016, we have initiated 6 company-sponsored, randomized controlled clinical trials for our products and, in coming quarters, expect to initiate several additional new studies, including a number for Acthar. I'll provide a bit more detail on some of our R&D programs in just a moment.
Now let me turn to Specialty Brands and give you some additional perspective on our performance. As in previous periods, publication of new data, combined with commercial and medical affairs focus, contributed to another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up 11% in the period driven entirely by volume. This volume growth was propelled by solid demand, increased contracting and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis as well as more mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome. We're particularly encouraged that our efforts are beginning to reach a whole new generation of physicians, providing them strong data on the benefits of this tried-and-true medication to treat patients suffering from complex and often devastating conditions such as infantile spasms and lupus. In infantile spasms, renewed focus has resulted in substantial share growth, improving reach to this fragile patient population. In the past several months, we believe recently published data on Acthar used in lupus patients has continued to help a new cohort of physicians better understand the value Acthar can provide to appropriate patients afflicted with this devastating disease. We're also seeing strong ongoing adoption in other indications as well, particularly steady increases in pulmonology prescribing as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 24% on a pro forma basis, reflecting both a favorable contracting cycle and an increase in demand. Utilization of nitric oxide has also been supported by treatment guidelines recently published jointly by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society. While we believe this business is likely to see near-term growth rates higher than historical norms, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates longer term.
I'm happy to report we achieved 14% revenue growth for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result of commercial execution bolstered by recent presentations of health economic data and a growing acceptance of the benefits multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system. We remain confident that growth for OFIRMEV will continue, allowing us to further expand patient reach.
We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Therakos, with net sales growth of 16% on a pro forma basis, and are especially pleased that this performance is the result of increased demand and significant growth across multiple geographies. Since acquiring the business nearly a year ago, we have advanced the service component of Therakos to better align with that of INOMAX and we're evaluating various commercial models to reach the best value proposition for customers and expand patient access. Longer term, we expect Therakos' growth to settle more in the historical high single-digit range.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We've recently begun the launch cycle for PreveLeak, expanding our U.S. hemostasis portfolio, and remain on track to launch Raplixa later this year. As we've said previously, this portfolio is expected to see double-digit growth longer term over its 2016 base of $40 million to $45 million, largely driven by the planned launches of these new products.
Turning to Specialty Generics. Net sales were down 14% versus last year's historical high. Despite these results, this business generates valuable cash flow and provides benefits to patients and the health care system with safe, cost-effective medicines. Many factors are contributing to the market volatility in this sector and we still expect the business to face significant headwinds for at least the next several quarters.
Providing some additional detail on science and technology, we continue to invest heavily in programs to support key in-line and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, and in the quarter, announced the first patient enrolled in our company-sponsored trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome called FSGS, the largest trial yet undertaken for this condition. In other areas of the portfolio, we completed preparations for the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, began recruiting patients and saw the first patient treated last month. We completed our company-sponsored controlled pharmacokinetic study evaluating the interaction profile of OFIRMEV given with IV morphine compared to oral acetaminophen given with IV morphine, and we expect to report the data in coming months. And we're pleased to report the first patient has entered our company-sponsored Phase IV study comparing OFIRMEV with oral acetaminophen in total knee replacement. Recruitment in this study is ongoing. As announced, we submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA for the study of Synacthen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and continue to drive development of this product. And finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is proceeding to plan.
On the business development front, we continue to be very active in optimizing our commercial and development portfolio. Key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms as well as the Specialty Generics business. We're assessing attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and developmental, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our proven strategy to bring value to patients and shareholders.

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. You've seen that third quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales from continuing operations were $971 million, representing growth of 11%.
Third quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $589 million, representing growth of 32%, reflecting especially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter with $298 million in net sales, an 11% increase. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $121 million in net sales, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis. This was exceptional for INOMAX. And we believe the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term, but we also anticipate that, longer range, INOMAX performance will be closer to historical growth levels in the mid-single digits. Turning to OFIRMEV: We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 14%. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $53 million, a 16% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter, though challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $263 million, representing a 14% decline over prior year. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging were $104 million, a 5% decline.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly less than anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics continued to drive these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. We're very pleased to report R&D spending in the quarter was up over prior year at 7.8% of net sales overall. We continue to be focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and beyond. In the third quarter, investment in our Specialty Brands segment was well above that spend level, with particular focus on Acthar.
Adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18.6% compared to 16.8%, affected primarily by business mix.
In transitioning from a Specialty Generics and imaging business to one dominated by Specialty Brands, Mallinckrodt has undergone significant organizational change in the last 3 years, and we expect this transformation to continue and even accelerate, near term, though it will eventually level off. Accordingly, our original 3-year restructuring program was completed in the fiscal third quarter and our board has authorized new restructuring in the amount of $100 million to $125 million to continue to refine our cost structure.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $412 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $861 million. Given the strong cash position in the quarter, we elected to pay $150 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At the same time, we returned $100 million in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total shares repurchased under our authorized program in the past 4 quarters to $675 million or 9.9 million shares, 8.3% of total fully diluted shares outstanding. Despite these actions, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $522 million and very manageable liquidity and leverage, with a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.5, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Notably, in July, we utilized cash to pay off the remaining balance of $250 million on our revolving credit facility.
We will continue this focus on working capital management. And while not anticipated at the levels achieved in the third quarter, we expect continued strong free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2016 and beyond. Our robust cash position continues to provide us significant flexibility as we consider additional business development opportunities.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

And if you noticed, in our prepared comments, we did highlight the fact that it's this combination of factors. We've been very clear to say that we believe that we have a product portfolio that has significant volume-upside opportunities, and we're demonstrating volume-driven growth across our Specialty Brands portfolio. That happens through this combination of efforts. And for a variety of our products, we've focused on generating new data. Some of that data is in the form of clinical studies. Some of that data is in the form of health economics studies, but there are many other forms of data. It's that combination of data generation with the commercial activities that we believe is driving the execution across the board. From an organizational standpoint, we do operate our brands business in a fairly focused manner in the sense that we have an organization that focuses specifically in the hospital area and another organization that focuses specifically in the autoimmune area. That enables us to have sufficient firepower and focus on those businesses and those customers to ensure that we execute our volume-based strategy going forward."

And again, our strategy around Acthar and driving growth opportunities for Acthar, I think, has been quite clear since the beginning. We said from the very beginning that our belief with this product is, one, that it's a very durable asset. It's a very durable asset that also has relatively low patient penetration. Those 2 things combined enabled us to start to invest in that product, and we have been investing significantly in data-generation activities around Acthar. And our belief is that we can drive long-term volume growth and greater patient penetration through a combination of market access activities as well as data generation. The way we think about it is market access kind of gives us the opportunity to drive data into new patients -- or sorry, new physicians and new patients, and we're seeing that type of momentum being created. So if we think about our objective, our objective in managed care was to ensure that we had open access to the indication set that we have for Acthar, which is extensive, as you know, with 19 separate indications. And our focus in managed care was and continues to be ensuring that we have this open access, so the approach there has been to contract for covered lives, particularly in the commercial sector. And our stated objective was to ensure that Acthar was under some form of a contract for open access in the majority of covered commercial lives. And when we started that proposition, when we acquired the product in 2014, Acthar was covered under contract by -- the proportion of covered lives under contract for Acthar was essentially 0, so over the course of the last 2 years or so, we have moved that from 0 to now greater than 50%. And we have reported a couple of times on the progress that we've made. And so we've been able to get the commercial lives contract that we -- commercial lives under contract through, I believe, some very attractive approaches in the managed care arena. Our objective, longer term, would be to continue to drive even greater access. We don't anticipate that we'll ever get to 100%, but we want to continue to ensure that Acthar has long-term access in managed care because, as we generate more data, it gives us a greater opportunity to further drive that product's volume growth longer term."

What we're seeing though, obviously, is that the Specialty Brands business performance has been so strong that it has been able to mitigate the impact of Specialty Generics. I would also highlight that the Specialty Generics segment is 27% of the revenue of Mallinckrodt. So -- and coming out of the gates, kind of going back to David Maris' question earlier, it was nearly 50% at spin. And so one of the ways we've been able to mute the risks and the challenges in the Specialty Generics business is the robust growth and the additions that we've made to the portfolio in Specialty Brands. So generally, what I would say is we were pleased with the performance in this quarter, but I would say really the weakness in the generics business is likely to be similar to what we expected earlier in the year. And this recent strength is really just going to be pushed out, and so we do foresee more challenges. But again, with it now being 27% of the revenue, that enabled us to increase guidance this morning as well because we're able to mitigate that risk."

And again, we're quite pleased with the growth that we're seeing in the hospital business between OFIRMEV, the outstanding performance of INOMAX, the strong performance of Therakos. These products are growing in the double-digit range across the board, and so we're quite pleased with the diversification in that portfolio. And in addition, now we're launching additional products and we've got a late-stage development asset in terlipressin, which we'll also add to this portfolio over time.

And we want to continue to enhance, develop, deepen our portfolio, both commercial assets as well as developmental assets, and we'll continue to do that through business development. If you look at our business in Autoimmune and Rare Diseases, which today is primarily Acthar, we really have presence, commercial and scientific presence, now in at least 4 or 5 different therapeutic areas. Our objective long term would be to build diversified businesses around those therapeutic areas and then continue to further expand our platform in the hospital, which is really a channel strategy. And it enables us to bring in a variety of different unique assets, all of which serve the hospitalized patients. So we like the strategy that we've set up. We believe we have 2 very scalable platforms in ARD and hospital. We believe there are some very, very attractive assets out there, both commercial as well as developmental assets.

And we're very pleased that we've been able to fairly dramatically accelerate that growth rate over the last several quarters, and we think that's a combination of effects. One is that we've clearly been able to contract effectively. Two, we're clearly seeing additional demand. And as you may recall, in our primary indication for INOMAX, which is for neonates in the NICU, we believe we had about a 50% patient penetration rate. And we believe, as a result of our contracting strategy, we're able to significantly now enhance that penetration rate, and that's certainly leading to some of the volume increases that we're seeing. We believe, again, this is a very durable asset. We've got intellectual property and patent protection for this asset both on the drug side as well as the device side that go out well into the late 2020s and into the 2030s. And you may have noticed that we actually just posted 3 additional new patents around this particular asset. We were also very pleased that we prevailed in the kind of the first round of the IPR activities, particularly on 4 out of the 5 drug patents. And keep in mind, in order to keep our exclusivity out into the late 2020s around the drug side, we only need to prevail on one of the claims in 1 of the patents. And there are multiple claims across multiple patents, so we feel quite strongly about this. And we'll continue to generate more intellectual property and patent estate, as you've just seen us do, as we go forward. So again, we think it's a very, very durable asset.

Again, 16% growth in the quarter is significantly higher than the historical growth rate that we had seen with this product before we acquired it roughly a year ago. Our hypothesis was that we could use some of the elements of the INOMAX approach and apply those to Therakos. And certainly, on the service side, the back-office side, we've already done that integration. And we believe that some of the enhanced growth that we're seeing in Therakos is the result of some of those synergies that we've been able to capture from the INOMAX model. We think there are also opportunities, longer term, for us to look at other commercial ways that we can further provide greater patient access to Therakos therapy by looking at the INOMAX model, although recognizing that the sales organizations are separate given that the sales approach in INOMAX is really into the neonatal population and in the Therakos case is a bit more into the adult population. We believe that the opportunities are significantly -- significant in CTCL for the simple reason that patient penetration rates there for appropriate patients are only on the order of about 10% to 15%. And we believe that the growth opportunities [ph] is primarily in that space near term. Obviously, we are also conducting additional work for Therakos to further expand the label. And our study in pediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we would expect, assuming that, that trial is positive, that, that could potentially lead to an expansion in the Therakos label, which again would give us greater volume growth opportunities longer term."

And as such, there is a certain amount of training and a certain amount of service that goes along with any kind of a device-drug combination, and that approach was finally honed in the INOMAX case. And so we've used that service and training approach with Therakos, a capability that wasn't quite as well developed. And again, we're seeing that benefit, we think, in the access to the accounts as a result of that streamlined sales and service model -- or primarily service and training model that we have from the INOMAX side. In terms of acute graft-versus-host disease, this is a study that will read out probably in the next 2 to 3 years. So again, this is a longer-term opportunity for Therakos. And we believe that, near term, there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive patient penetration and volume in CTCL."

And again, given the durability of this asset, we believe the investments on the clinical side are very important and are likely to continue to drive Acthar volume long term. We're in the process right now, as you know, of essentially wrapping up some of the trials that had been initiated under previous ownership, but we're also dramatically and significantly increasing our investment across-the-board in Acthar data generation, including a number of clinical trials. As you saw, each quarter, we've been reporting on the number of data sets that read out. A lot of the data that we've been generating that's new, if you will, is on the health economics side because, as you might imagine, there is a wealth of data available in the marketplace for this product that just needs to be analyzed, quantified and presented. And so we'll focus near term on using that information and bringing it to the marketplace. And we believe that's certainly having an impact on a variety of different physicians and managed care organizations, as we really now quantify that -- the pretty significant data set that currently exists for Acthar. On the clinical side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've initiated 6 clinical trials this year. We plan to initiate several more. That's across our branded portfolio, and several of these will be in the Acthar arena. We already gave you some insight into the fact that we're going to be doing another trial in lupus significantly larger than we had done initially -- or had been done initially which we would consider to be a pilot trial. And we were very pleased with the outcome of that pilot trial, which gives us very good confidence to go ahead and invest further in lupus, but there are other areas in the Acthar label that we believe could give us significant opportunities through additional controlled clinical trials. And as we finalize the details of those trials, we'll be reporting on those, but those trials are now just initiating and so, they'll typically take a couple of years before they read out. The way I'd think about this, though, is much like we did in the lupus arena, we want to focus the controlled clinical data, particularly that's -- that of which, which is either active control or placebo control, in patient subpopulations, like we did in the lupus arena, which is a particularly standard way that one would go about generating clinical data for indications that you already have on label. Again, our focus will be primarily on generating data for on-label indications, and we will continue to look for other opportunities to drive Acthar growth through data generation in the coming years."

Infantile spasms, for example, we're seeing significant growth in market share as we refocus the neurology sales force into this area. And that's certainly a significant benefit for patients. And as you know, we have very, very strong data for Acthar's use in infantile spasms. We're seeing a lot of growth in the rheumatology arena, again, across-the-board. And we believe, based on market research, that the lupus data that was presented in 2 tranches for Acthar, both the controlled phase as well as the open-label phase, is starting to open up to a whole new cohort of physicians a further opportunity for those physicians to provide benefit to their lupus patients. We're seeing significant growth in the area of sarcoidosis, as data was presented earlier this year which shows Acthar's utility in that space, where there are really very, very few options for these very, very sick patients. So across pulmonology, rheumatology, certainly in infantile spasms, these are the areas that are continuing to drive growth. In terms of sales force, I think that we have a significant and appropriately sized sales organization. Keep in mind that each one of our sales forces is really focused primarily on a given therapeutic area, which means that each one of these sales forces is highly specialized. And I think, while the sales force certainly is having an impact, it's really the intersection of the activities that we're generating between market access, the sales organization and then really the generation of significant additional data, particularly on the health economics side, which together these 3 things, I believe, are really starting to open up a whole new group of physicians and their interest in Acthar and the prescribing and the volume that we're seeing as a result of that combination of factors."

As we said quite clearly, we expect that INOMAX growth in the near term will be higher than it has been historically, but longer term, it's probably going to migrate closer to what it has been historically in the mid-single-digit range. We believe that the enhanced growth for INOMAX, and keep in mind we have been growing INOMAX since we acquired it at multiples of the historical growth rate, we think that has to do, one, with the enhanced contracting strategy. And again, this is good for the accounts, it's good for the business, and it's good for the patients. And our contracting strategy is pretty straightforward in that we offer INOMAX in an unlimited-use fashion, which then enables physicians, particularly in the NICU, not to have to make a choice between a patient that's very sick and another one that's not quite as sick in terms of whether they get INOMAX or not. And we believe that is likely to drive additional patient penetration in appropriate patients in the NICU. We've also, we believe, have benefited a bit from the guidelines around the use of nitric oxide that were recently published in the last year or so jointly by the American heart -- or American Hospital Association and the American Thoracic Society, which advocate the use of nitric oxide earlier in patients to provide additional benefit. So we believe that it's the combination of those factors, plus a significantly enhanced set of commercial activities that we've been driving to take advantage of the contracting strategy, that are leading to this enhanced performance. Again longer term, we would expect that -- because we've been benefiting upfront from significant contracting activities that, that's going to level out over time, which is why we're projecting that the growth rate is likely to settle in longer term to that historical growth rate. So again, very pleased with INOMAX. We're very pleased with the things that we've been able to do with it in the last year or so to enhance the growth rate. And we will continue to invest in this product to provide benefit for more patients."

Particularly when we brought Acthar into the portfolio, we were able to get our net debt leverage down pretty significantly in a quick period. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that we've focused on buying assets that had good LTMs and had very strong cash flow. As you saw in the release this morning, we are at 3.5 from a net debt leverage perspective. The difference between here and there was, back then, we were generating $150 million to $200 million in cash flow, and here we are. A few years out, we're generating $1 billion, as you saw with our performance in the third quarter. It puts us in great shape to deliver on that, as I said earlier. So we haven't really given a specific number on net debt leverage, but if we take it up, we delever relatively quickly. Haven't seen any material impact from the guidelines on the business. Typically, these types of guidelines, you can see them coming for miles. And so yes, there's pressure. Yes, there's downward pressure on controlled substances in this country. And so that's factored into all of our guidance and all of the thinking that we provided this time last year, quite frankly, on the earnings call. As it relates to oxycodone and hydrocodone, I would say they were better than what we were expecting in this quarter, and that's why we're forecasting more challenges as we move into future quarters."

We don't feel constrained at all, frankly, in our ability to acquire those assets, primarily because of the fantastic cash flow that we have, but as Matt said, if there's an opportunity that's out there that requires us to take on some debt, we will do that but we will pay it down quickly, as we've done, as you've seen us do. Even in this quarter, we paid down our debt dramatically. So again, we would look for things that make great financial sense, great strategic sense.

We believe that Acthar is an exceptionally durable asset. While, theoretically, anything is possible, and we fully would expect competition over time to Acthar -- enhanced competition over time because there's a lot of competition to Acthar today. We would expect that, that type of competition, particularly in the corticotropin area, is likely to come through the NDA route. And if it does come through the NDA route, it's likely going to be a fairly complex process to get there. We continue to believe that the likelihood of an AB-rated generic Acthar is very, very low. Again, this is a product that today is a complex mixture of a variety of active, naturally derived agents. It's significantly more complex than Lovenox. Lovenox is essentially a single peptide. And we believe that the opportunity, as it exists today, for an AB-rated generic is exceptionally low because a pathway currently doesn't exist. The active agents in Acthar are very complex, only some of which are fully characterized. And we just believe that this pathway is highly unlikely. Although anything is theoretically possible, we think this is perhaps the least likely area in the near term and perhaps in the long term for future Acthar competition."

We believe we'll be able to continue to drive volume growth for OFIRMEV going forward primarily because of the fact that this is a product that we continue to demonstrate has significant both clinical utility as well as has a very positive pharmacoeconomic proposition. And in the quarter and in this past year, we've consistently been posting a number of different data sets highlighting the pharmacoeconomic benefits of Acthar -- or of OFIRMEV. So again, very pleased with the performance and we think we can continue to drive growth. The other piece of it, I think, is that it clearly looks like a multimodal analgesia is the approach that many institutions are now moving towards in the management of pain associated with surgery, and OFIRMEV fits very squarely in that type of a protocol. So we think the factors are moving in the right direction to continue to support the volume growth of OFIRMEV going forward."

And I think, as you know, we don't give specific gross margin guidance anyway, but I think it's a good point to remind people that, because of our 4-5-4 accounting structure that we've talked about ad nauseam, in the September quarter that we're in right now, we're going to have an extra week. We've talked about that. And clearly, it means the September quarter is probably going to look pretty good on the revenue side of things. It's going to look pretty good on the margin side of things. I would note that -- and I salute the sell side out there because, if you look at the cadence of estimates that are out there, it looks like you guys have already pretty much taken into account the fact that we've got the extra week in September. And so it certainly shows that way when you look at the cadence of numbers throughout the year. Obviously, in the June quarter, we had very, very strong fundamentals that you just saw. In the September quarter, we've got that extra week going for us. The reason why I bring that up is, once we get into the December quarter, we should be back to a much more normal kind of a run rate again. And I think it's important you take that into account when you're comparing the quantitative numbers, both the really good numbers that you saw that we announced this morning as well as the probable pretty good numbers that you're going to see in the September quarter.

And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another very strong quarter, driven by outstanding performance across the Specialty Brands portfolio and a more moderate decline than we expected for Specialty Generics. Our excellent performance reflects an ongoing focus on execution, especially in our Specialty Brands commercial and scientific organizations, as we continue to generate compelling new data and clinical evidence for key brands and work to bring this data to new physicians and patients, clear evidence that our Acquire to Invest strategy is creating performance momentum.
Net sales were up 11% for the third quarter, led by steady volume increases across the Specialty Brands segment which as a whole was up 32%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 9% for the quarter. This volume-based performance in Specialty Brands continues the trend established over the past several quarters. And looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to drive volume growth in this segment. Our strong showing here clearly demonstrates that we are executing against our strategy by investing in our specialty brands to create near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders. In Specialty Generics, the decline in the quarter was somewhat less steep than we had anticipated, and this segment continues to generate solid cash flow. But while this quarter's performance was more positive, our expectations remain consistent with those we described a year ago, and we foresee pressure on this segment for at least the next several quarters.
Our focus on execution across the business is contributing to our progress as we continue to make strategic investments to build our brand assets and grow volumes in areas of high unmet medical need. Let me illustrate that further.
We're building on the growing body of evidence for our products by generating new clinical and health economic data. In the quarter, we had approximately 40 data presentations and publications, including nearly 20 for Acthar and more than a dozen for INOMAX, bringing our overall year-to-date total to roughly 80 publications and presentations. More than 1/4 of these have focused on quantifying health economic outcomes and we anticipate this overall level of data generation to continue. Perhaps most importantly, in fiscal 2016, we have initiated 6 company-sponsored, randomized controlled clinical trials for our products and, in coming quarters, expect to initiate several additional new studies, including a number for Acthar. I'll provide a bit more detail on some of our R&D programs in just a moment.
Now let me turn to Specialty Brands and give you some additional perspective on our performance. As in previous periods, publication of new data, combined with commercial and medical affairs focus, contributed to another strong quarter for Acthar, with net sales up 11% in the period driven entirely by volume. This volume growth was propelled by solid demand, increased contracting and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis as well as more mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome. We're particularly encouraged that our efforts are beginning to reach a whole new generation of physicians, providing them strong data on the benefits of this tried-and-true medication to treat patients suffering from complex and often devastating conditions such as infantile spasms and lupus. In infantile spasms, renewed focus has resulted in substantial share growth, improving reach to this fragile patient population. In the past several months, we believe recently published data on Acthar used in lupus patients has continued to help a new cohort of physicians better understand the value Acthar can provide to appropriate patients afflicted with this devastating disease. We're also seeing strong ongoing adoption in other indications as well, particularly steady increases in pulmonology prescribing as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 24% on a pro forma basis, reflecting both a favorable contracting cycle and an increase in demand. Utilization of nitric oxide has also been supported by treatment guidelines recently published jointly by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society. While we believe this business is likely to see near-term growth rates higher than historical norms, we anticipate a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates longer term.
I'm happy to report we achieved 14% revenue growth for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result of commercial execution bolstered by recent presentations of health economic data and a growing acceptance of the benefits multimodal analgesia brings to patients and the health care system. We remain confident that growth for OFIRMEV will continue, allowing us to further expand patient reach.
We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Therakos, with net sales growth of 16% on a pro forma basis, and are especially pleased that this performance is the result of increased demand and significant growth across multiple geographies. Since acquiring the business nearly a year ago, we have advanced the service component of Therakos to better align with that of INOMAX and we're evaluating various commercial models to reach the best value proposition for customers and expand patient access. Longer term, we expect Therakos' growth to settle more in the historical high single-digit range.
Closing out Specialty Brands. We've recently begun the launch cycle for PreveLeak, expanding our U.S. hemostasis portfolio, and remain on track to launch Raplixa later this year. As we've said previously, this portfolio is expected to see double-digit growth longer term over its 2016 base of $40 million to $45 million, largely driven by the planned launches of these new products.
Turning to Specialty Generics. Net sales were down 14% versus last year's historical high. Despite these results, this business generates valuable cash flow and provides benefits to patients and the health care system with safe, cost-effective medicines. Many factors are contributing to the market volatility in this sector and we still expect the business to face significant headwinds for at least the next several quarters.
Providing some additional detail on science and technology, we continue to invest heavily in programs to support key in-line and developmental products, particularly in Specialty Brands, and in the quarter, announced the first patient enrolled in our company-sponsored trial for Acthar in a key nephrotic syndrome called FSGS, the largest trial yet undertaken for this condition. In other areas of the portfolio, we completed preparations for the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, began recruiting patients and saw the first patient treated last month. We completed our company-sponsored controlled pharmacokinetic study evaluating the interaction profile of OFIRMEV given with IV morphine compared to oral acetaminophen given with IV morphine, and we expect to report the data in coming months. And we're pleased to report the first patient has entered our company-sponsored Phase IV study comparing OFIRMEV with oral acetaminophen in total knee replacement. Recruitment in this study is ongoing. As announced, we submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA for the study of Synacthen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and continue to drive development of this product. And finally, our company-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Therakos therapy in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease is proceeding to plan.
On the business development front, we continue to be very active in optimizing our commercial and development portfolio. Key areas of focus remain building on our Specialty Brands growth platforms as well as the Specialty Generics business. We're assessing attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and developmental, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters.

232036063,367067633,1022371,"Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Mallinckrodt PLC","Executives","Thanks, Mark.Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. You've seen that third quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales from co",683,"Thanks, Mark.
Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. You've seen that third quarter fiscal 2016 was very strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales from continuing operations were $971 million, representing growth of 11%.
Third quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $589 million, representing growth of 32%, reflecting especially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter with $298 million in net sales, an 11% increase. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $121 million in net sales, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis. This was exceptional for INOMAX. And we believe the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term, but we also anticipate that, longer range, INOMAX performance will be closer to historical growth levels in the mid-single digits. Turning to OFIRMEV: We were very pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, with revenue growth of 14%. The Therakos business also performed well with net sales of $53 million, a 16% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to our Specialty Generics segment, which performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter, though challenged by increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $263 million, representing a 14% decline over prior year. Segment net sales for Nuclear Imaging were $104 million, a 5% decline.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly less than anticipated. Tough comparables in Specialty Generics continued to drive these results, albeit they were partially offset by strong Specialty Brands performance. We're very pleased to report R&D spending in the quarter was up over prior year at 7.8% of net sales overall. We continue to be focused on accelerating investments in key opportunities for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and beyond. In the third quarter, investment in our Specialty Brands segment was well above that spend level, with particular focus on Acthar.
Adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18.6% compared to 16.8%, affected primarily by business mix.
In transitioning from a Specialty Generics and imaging business to one dominated by Specialty Brands, Mallinckrodt has undergone significant organizational change in the last 3 years, and we expect this transformation to continue and even accelerate, near term, though it will eventually level off. Accordingly, our original 3-year restructuring program was completed in the fiscal third quarter and our board has authorized new restructuring in the amount of $100 million to $125 million to continue to refine our cost structure.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $412 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $861 million. Given the strong cash position in the quarter, we elected to pay $150 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At the same time, we returned $100 million in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total shares repurchased under our authorized program in the past 4 quarters to $675 million or 9.9 million shares, 8.3% of total fully diluted shares outstanding. Despite these actions, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $522 million and very manageable liquidity and leverage, with a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.5, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Notably, in July, we utilized cash to pay off the remaining balance of $250 million on our revolving credit facility.
We will continue this focus on working capital management. And while not anticipated at the levels achieved in the third quarter, we expect continued strong free cash flow generation through the remainder of 2016 and beyond. Our robust cash position continues to provide us significant flexibility as we consider additional business development opportunities.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole, who will take us into Q&A."

And if you noticed, in our prepared comments, we did highlight the fact that it's this combination of factors. We've been very clear to say that we believe that we have a product portfolio that has significant volume-upside opportunities, and we're demonstrating volume-driven growth across our Specialty Brands portfolio. That happens through this combination of efforts. And for a variety of our products, we've focused on generating new data. Some of that data is in the form of clinical studies. Some of that data is in the form of health economics studies, but there are many other forms of data. It's that combination of data generation with the commercial activities that we believe is driving the execution across the board. From an organizational standpoint, we do operate our brands business in a fairly focused manner in the sense that we have an organization that focuses specifically in the hospital area and another organization that focuses specifically in the autoimmune area. That enables us to have sufficient firepower and focus on those businesses and those customers to ensure that we execute our volume-based strategy going forward."

And again, our strategy around Acthar and driving growth opportunities for Acthar, I think, has been quite clear since the beginning. We said from the very beginning that our belief with this product is, one, that it's a very durable asset. It's a very durable asset that also has relatively low patient penetration. Those 2 things combined enabled us to start to invest in that product, and we have been investing significantly in data-generation activities around Acthar. And our belief is that we can drive long-term volume growth and greater patient penetration through a combination of market access activities as well as data generation. The way we think about it is market access kind of gives us the opportunity to drive data into new patients -- or sorry, new physicians and new patients, and we're seeing that type of momentum being created. So if we think about our objective, our objective in managed care was to ensure that we had open access to the indication set that we have for Acthar, which is extensive, as you know, with 19 separate indications. And our focus in managed care was and continues to be ensuring that we have this open access, so the approach there has been to contract for covered lives, particularly in the commercial sector. And our stated objective was to ensure that Acthar was under some form of a contract for open access in the majority of covered commercial lives. And when we started that proposition, when we acquired the product in 2014, Acthar was covered under contract by -- the proportion of covered lives under contract for Acthar was essentially 0, so over the course of the last 2 years or so, we have moved that from 0 to now greater than 50%. And we have reported a couple of times on the progress that we've made. And so we've been able to get the commercial lives contract that we -- commercial lives under contract through, I believe, some very attractive approaches in the managed care arena. Our objective, longer term, would be to continue to drive even greater access. We don't anticipate that we'll ever get to 100%, but we want to continue to ensure that Acthar has long-term access in managed care because, as we generate more data, it gives us a greater opportunity to further drive that product's volume growth longer term."

What we're seeing though, obviously, is that the Specialty Brands business performance has been so strong that it has been able to mitigate the impact of Specialty Generics. I would also highlight that the Specialty Generics segment is 27% of the revenue of Mallinckrodt. So -- and coming out of the gates, kind of going back to David Maris' question earlier, it was nearly 50% at spin. And so one of the ways we've been able to mute the risks and the challenges in the Specialty Generics business is the robust growth and the additions that we've made to the portfolio in Specialty Brands. So generally, what I would say is we were pleased with the performance in this quarter, but I would say really the weakness in the generics business is likely to be similar to what we expected earlier in the year. And this recent strength is really just going to be pushed out, and so we do foresee more challenges. But again, with it now being 27% of the revenue, that enabled us to increase guidance this morning as well because we're able to mitigate that risk."

And again, we're quite pleased with the growth that we're seeing in the hospital business between OFIRMEV, the outstanding performance of INOMAX, the strong performance of Therakos. These products are growing in the double-digit range across the board, and so we're quite pleased with the diversification in that portfolio. And in addition, now we're launching additional products and we've got a late-stage development asset in terlipressin, which we'll also add to this portfolio over time. And so we think the diversification of our portfolio is actually quite strong now, but we're not done. And we want to continue to enhance, develop, deepen our portfolio, both commercial assets as well as developmental assets, and we'll continue to do that through business development. If you look at our business in Autoimmune and Rare Diseases, which today is primarily Acthar, we really have presence, commercial and scientific presence, now in at least 4 or 5 different therapeutic areas. Our objective long term would be to build diversified businesses around those therapeutic areas and then continue to further expand our platform in the hospital, which is really a channel strategy. And it enables us to bring in a variety of different unique assets, all of which serve the hospitalized patients. So we like the strategy that we've set up. We believe we have 2 very scalable platforms in ARD and hospital. We believe there are some very, very attractive assets out there, both commercial as well as developmental assets. And we want to continue to use our strong cash flow that you saw demonstrated in this quarter to go out and acquire those assets to diversify ourselves so that we have a well-diversified portfolio, even more so than today, of both commercial and developmental assets.

And we're very pleased that we've been able to fairly dramatically accelerate that growth rate over the last several quarters, and we think that's a combination of effects. One is that we've clearly been able to contract effectively. Two, we're clearly seeing additional demand. And as you may recall, in our primary indication for INOMAX, which is for neonates in the NICU, we believe we had about a 50% patient penetration rate. And we believe, as a result of our contracting strategy, we're able to significantly now enhance that penetration rate, and that's certainly leading to some of the volume increases that we're seeing. We believe, again, this is a very durable asset. We've got intellectual property and patent protection for this asset both on the drug side as well as the device side that go out well into the late 2020s and into the 2030s. And you may have noticed that we actually just posted 3 additional new patents around this particular asset. We were also very pleased that we prevailed in the kind of the first round of the IPR activities, particularly on 4 out of the 5 drug patents. And keep in mind, in order to keep our exclusivity out into the late 2020s around the drug side, we only need to prevail on one of the claims in 1 of the patents. And there are multiple claims across multiple patents, so we feel quite strongly about this. And we'll continue to generate more intellectual property and patent estate, as you've just seen us do, as we go forward. So again, we think it's a very, very durable asset. In terms of a generic entry coming in, we think that's a highly unlikely proposition, certainly not before the late 2020s, at this point."

Again, 16% growth in the quarter is significantly higher than the historical growth rate that we had seen with this product before we acquired it roughly a year ago. Our hypothesis was that we could use some of the elements of the INOMAX approach and apply those to Therakos. And certainly, on the service side, the back-office side, we've already done that integration. And we believe that some of the enhanced growth that we're seeing in Therakos is the result of some of those synergies that we've been able to capture from the INOMAX model. We think there are also opportunities, longer term, for us to look at other commercial ways that we can further provide greater patient access to Therakos therapy by looking at the INOMAX model, although recognizing that the sales organizations are separate given that the sales approach in INOMAX is really into the neonatal population and in the Therakos case is a bit more into the adult population. We believe that the opportunities are significantly -- significant in CTCL for the simple reason that patient penetration rates there for appropriate patients are only on the order of about 10% to 15%. And we believe that the growth opportunities [ph] is primarily in that space near term. Obviously, we are also conducting additional work for Therakos to further expand the label. And our study in pediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease is ongoing, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks.

And so we've used that service and training approach with Therakos, a capability that wasn't quite as well developed. And again, we're seeing that benefit, we think, in the access to the accounts as a result of that streamlined sales and service model -- or primarily service and training model that we have from the INOMAX side. In terms of acute graft-versus-host disease, this is a study that will read out probably in the next 2 to 3 years. So again, this is a longer-term opportunity for Therakos. And we believe that, near term, there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive patient penetration and volume in CTCL."

Gregg, there were a few kind of one-timers in there, but the lion's share, by far, of the cash delivery was the strength that we saw in the Specialty Brands business. Particularly, INOMAX and Acthar generated very strong cash for us. And then with generics being a bit stronger than what we were anticipating earlier in the year, the amount of cash that it generated was greater than what we had expected. But it will certainly moderate, but I can tell you, when we gave guidance a year ago, that we were looking to see approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. I was really happy to see such strong cash in the third quarter because it puts us in good shape to deliver on that commitment."

And again, given the durability of this asset, we believe the investments on the clinical side are very important and are likely to continue to drive Acthar volume long term. We're in the process right now, as you know, of essentially wrapping up some of the trials that had been initiated under previous ownership, but we're also dramatically and significantly increasing our investment across-the-board in Acthar data generation, including a number of clinical trials. As you saw, each quarter, we've been reporting on the number of data sets that read out. A lot of the data that we've been generating that's new, if you will, is on the health economics side because, as you might imagine, there is a wealth of data available in the marketplace for this product that just needs to be analyzed, quantified and presented. And so we'll focus near term on using that information and bringing it to the marketplace. And we believe that's certainly having an impact on a variety of different physicians and managed care organizations, as we really now quantify that -- the pretty significant data set that currently exists for Acthar. On the clinical side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've initiated 6 clinical trials this year. We plan to initiate several more. That's across our branded portfolio, and several of these will be in the Acthar arena. We already gave you some insight into the fact that we're going to be doing another trial in lupus significantly larger than we had done initially -- or had been done initially which we would consider to be a pilot trial. And we were very pleased with the outcome of that pilot trial, which gives us very good confidence to go ahead and invest further in lupus, but there are other areas in the Acthar label that we believe could give us significant opportunities through additional controlled clinical trials. And as we finalize the details of those trials, we'll be reporting on those, but those trials are now just initiating and so, they'll typically take a couple of years before they read out. The way I'd think about this, though, is much like we did in the lupus arena, we want to focus the controlled clinical data, particularly that's -- that of which, which is either active control or placebo control, in patient subpopulations, like we did in the lupus arena, which is a particularly standard way that one would go about generating clinical data for indications that you already have on label. Again, our focus will be primarily on generating data for on-label indications, and we will continue to look for other opportunities to drive Acthar growth through data generation in the coming years."

Infantile spasms, for example, we're seeing significant growth in market share as we refocus the neurology sales force into this area. And that's certainly a significant benefit for patients. And as you know, we have very, very strong data for Acthar's use in infantile spasms. We're seeing a lot of growth in the rheumatology arena, again, across-the-board. And we believe, based on market research, that the lupus data that was presented in 2 tranches for Acthar, both the controlled phase as well as the open-label phase, is starting to open up to a whole new cohort of physicians a further opportunity for those physicians to provide benefit to their lupus patients. We're seeing significant growth in the area of sarcoidosis, as data was presented earlier this year which shows Acthar's utility in that space, where there are really very, very few options for these very, very sick patients. So across pulmonology, rheumatology, certainly in infantile spasms, these are the areas that are continuing to drive growth. In terms of sales force, I think that we have a significant and appropriately sized sales organization. Keep in mind that each one of our sales forces is really focused primarily on a given therapeutic area, which means that each one of these sales forces is highly specialized. And I think, while the sales force certainly is having an impact, it's really the intersection of the activities that we're generating between market access, the sales organization and then really the generation of significant additional data, particularly on the health economics side, which together these 3 things, I believe, are really starting to open up a whole new group of physicians and their interest in Acthar and the prescribing and the volume that we're seeing as a result of that combination of factors."

As we said quite clearly, we expect that INOMAX growth in the near term will be higher than it has been historically, but longer term, it's probably going to migrate closer to what it has been historically in the mid-single-digit range. We believe that the enhanced growth for INOMAX, and keep in mind we have been growing INOMAX since we acquired it at multiples of the historical growth rate, we think that has to do, one, with the enhanced contracting strategy. And again, this is good for the accounts, it's good for the business, and it's good for the patients. And our contracting strategy is pretty straightforward in that we offer INOMAX in an unlimited-use fashion, which then enables physicians, particularly in the NICU, not to have to make a choice between a patient that's very sick and another one that's not quite as sick in terms of whether they get INOMAX or not. And we believe that is likely to drive additional patient penetration in appropriate patients in the NICU. We've also, we believe, have benefited a bit from the guidelines around the use of nitric oxide that were recently published in the last year or so jointly by the American heart -- or American Hospital Association and the American Thoracic Society, which advocate the use of nitric oxide earlier in patients to provide additional benefit. So we believe that it's the combination of those factors, plus a significantly enhanced set of commercial activities that we've been driving to take advantage of the contracting strategy, that are leading to this enhanced performance. Again longer term, we would expect that -- because we've been benefiting upfront from significant contracting activities that, that's going to level out over time, which is why we're projecting that the growth rate is likely to settle in longer term to that historical growth rate. So again, very pleased with INOMAX. We're very pleased with the things that we've been able to do with it in the last year or so to enhance the growth rate. And we will continue to invest in this product to provide benefit for more patients."

Particularly when we brought Acthar into the portfolio, we were able to get our net debt leverage down pretty significantly in a quick period.

As you saw in the release this morning, we are at 3.5 from a net debt leverage perspective. The difference between here and there was, back then, we were generating $150 million to $200 million in cash flow, and here we are. A few years out, we're generating $1 billion, as you saw with our performance in the third quarter. It puts us in great shape to deliver on that, as I said earlier. So we haven't really given a specific number on net debt leverage, but if we take it up, we delever relatively quickly. Haven't seen any material impact from the guidelines on the business. Typically, these types of guidelines, you can see them coming for miles. And so yes, there's pressure. Yes, there's downward pressure on controlled substances in this country.

Even in this quarter, we paid down our debt dramatically. So again, we would look for things that make great financial sense, great strategic sense. And again, if our net debt leverage goes up for a bit, we want to make sure that we can delever very quickly, as Matt said. And the bottom line is we don't feel constrained at all in our ability to acquire very good assets. And we believe a number of those are out there."

So Teva has publicly stated that it may try to pursue a generic for Acthar.

We believe that Acthar is an exceptionally durable asset. While, theoretically, anything is possible, and we fully would expect competition over time to Acthar -- enhanced competition over time because there's a lot of competition to Acthar today. We would expect that, that type of competition, particularly in the corticotropin area, is likely to come through the NDA route. And if it does come through the NDA route, it's likely going to be a fairly complex process to get there. We continue to believe that the likelihood of an AB-rated generic Acthar is very, very low. Again, this is a product that today is a complex mixture of a variety of active, naturally derived agents. It's significantly more complex than Lovenox. Lovenox is essentially a single peptide. And we believe that the opportunity, as it exists today, for an AB-rated generic is exceptionally low because a pathway currently doesn't exist. The active agents in Acthar are very complex, only some of which are fully characterized. And we just believe that this pathway is highly unlikely. Although anything is theoretically possible, we think this is perhaps the least likely area in the near term and perhaps in the long term for future Acthar competition."

We believe we'll be able to continue to drive volume growth for OFIRMEV going forward primarily because of the fact that this is a product that we continue to demonstrate has significant both clinical utility as well as has a very positive pharmacoeconomic proposition. And in the quarter and in this past year, we've consistently been posting a number of different data sets highlighting the pharmacoeconomic benefits of Acthar -- or of OFIRMEV. So again, very pleased with the performance and we think we can continue to drive growth. The other piece of it, I think, is that it clearly looks like a multimodal analgesia is the approach that many institutions are now moving towards in the management of pain associated with surgery, and OFIRMEV fits very squarely in that type of a protocol. So we think the factors are moving in the right direction to continue to support the volume growth of OFIRMEV going forward."

And I think, as you know, we don't give specific gross margin guidance anyway, but I think it's a good point to remind people that, because of our 4-5-4 accounting structure that we've talked about ad nauseam, in the September quarter that we're in right now, we're going to have an extra week. We've talked about that. And clearly, it means the September quarter is probably going to look pretty good on the revenue side of things. It's going to look pretty good on the margin side of things. I would note that -- and I salute the sell side out there because, if you look at the cadence of estimates that are out there, it looks like you guys have already pretty much taken into account the fact that we've got the extra week in September. And so it certainly shows that way when you look at the cadence of numbers throughout the year. Obviously, in the June quarter, we had very, very strong fundamentals that you just saw. In the September quarter, we've got that extra week going for us. The reason why I bring that up is, once we get into the December quarter, we should be back to a much more normal kind of a run rate again. And I think it's important you take that into account when you're comparing the quantitative numbers, both the really good numbers that you saw that we announced this morning as well as the probable pretty good numbers that you're going to see in the September quarter.

Mark will start us off with some brief comments, then Matt will follow providing details on our financials. We'll then go to our customary Q&A session. 
Before we begin, let me remind you of some important details. On the call, you'll hear us making some forward-looking statements, and it's possible that actual results could be materially different from our current expectations. Please note that we assume no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. We ask you to please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
We'll also provide some non-GAAP adjusted financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to GAAP is detailed in our earnings release and its related financial tables, which will be found in our website, mallinckrodt.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations pages of our website for such information. 
As noted in our press release, unless otherwise specified, all comparisons of quarterly or annual performance are to the fourth quarter or full year of fiscal 2015. In addition, the revenue growth ranges we'll be discussing today are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, the last quarter of 2016 included an extra selling week, a phenomenon that occurs once every 5 or 6 years with our 52, 53-week fiscal year accounting convention. While the exact quantification of the impact of the extra week is extremely difficult to determine, we believe it added approximately 6 to 9 percentage points to the quarterly sales growth rate of the company as a whole, and about 1 to 3 percentage points to our annual sales growth.
We're providing this estimated sales impact at the total Mallinckrodt level to give you context, but caution that you should not extrapolate it to any particular segment or product line as that may give you an inaccurate picture of our actual performance. 
For the September quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01, with full year fiscal 2016 GAAP earnings of $4.39. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings for the quarter came in at $2.04 per share and $7.85 per share for the full year fiscal year 2016.

As has been",2068,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another strong volume-driven quarter to end fiscal year 2016, even before the positive impact of the extra selling week. As has been the case all year, our robust performance across Specialty Brands has more than offset expected declines in Specialty Generics, which continued to face significant challenges. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to fulfill our strategic vision in the quarter, with additional transformation of our portfolio. For example, we announced the planned divestiture of our Nuclear Imaging business; achieved wins in INOMAX intellectual property that we believe will further expand [ph] the durability of this asset; enhanced our growing organic pipeline, with acquisition of an innovative development platform of regenerative medicine skin substitutes that have the potential to transform the standard of treatment for burns and wound healing; advanced our trials for terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and Synacthen Depot in the treatment of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and just last week, we announced the new trial for Acthar in treatment of ALS.
These accomplishments marked the beginning of our transition into what we see as the next exciting chapter of our long-term strategic road map for a sustainable success, driving in-line products, fostering innovation with investments in a growing organic pipeline, and providing new patients with access to powerful effective treatment.
In our Brands business, strong focus on execution drove our achievements, and provides a great example of our Acquire to Invest strategy in action. We generate new clinical and health economic evidence, and then ensure the data is shared with health care providers and payers to help them understand the value our therapies bring to patients and the health care system.
Net sales were up 14% and 16% for the September quarter and the year, respectively, led by steady volume increases and strong performance across the Specialty Brands segment, which, as a whole, was up 36% for the quarter and 42% for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 21% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This pattern of solid predominantly volume-based growth in Specialty Brands has been consistent over the past several quarters, and we see that trend continuing as we look ahead.
In Specialty Generics, which now represents less than 30% of our total net sales, the 19% decline in the quarter was consistent with our expectations. We've continued to project strong headwinds for this business for some time and expect significant downward pressure on the segment to persist. Having said that, the segment continues to generate cash. And we're focused on supplementing performance through careful cost management and select introduction of new ANDAs.
Regarding our methylphenidate ER product and the FDA's recent actions, we continue to disagree with the agency's position based on scientific grounds, and we believe it's not consistent with the best interest of patients. We're moving forward with the hearing process, and we're pleased the agency granted our request for a 90-day extension, allowing us to submit more robust documentation. The evidence we're compiling demonstrates why we believe our therapy should remain available to ADHD patients who can benefit from this cost-effective alternative. As the process moves forward, we'll provide updates as appropriate, and we will continuously -- we will continue to vigorously defend the safety and effectiveness of our drug.
Now let me give you some additional perspective on the key products in our Specialty Brands business. Acthar contributed another strong quarter, with net sales up 19% in the period, driven predominantly by volume. Obviously, we're very pleased, but note that absent the extra week, these results would have been more in line with our expected mid-single to low double-digit range. We saw continued growth particularly in rheumatology, pulmonology and nephrology. This strong volume growth continues in this quarter, consistent with what we've seen since the acquisition, propelled by our investments as well as commercial and medical affairs execution.
In rheumatology, we saw a steady prescription growth in both rheumatoid arthritis and in lupus, where we believe the published data on Acthar use continues to help physicians better understand the value it can provide to certain patients with these diseases. We're also seeing steady increases in pulmonology prescribing, as physicians absorbed recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. And we have redoubled our efforts in nephrology, helping us to continue to grow in that space.
Early feedback from our launch into ophthalmology is also promising, and we're dedicating resources to expand our efforts in this therapeutic area. In infantile spasms, intensified efforts to ensure that infants afflicted with this condition have access to Acthar brought consistent market share gains across the past several quarters. We're committed to further broadening and improving our reach to this fragile patient population.
We continue to advance our Acthar market access strategy and engage with key payers. Acthar now has nearly 60% of commercial lives under contract, and we see potential for more. We're continuing to find ways to partner with payers to improve appropriate patient access. Overall contract performance has aligned with our expectations, informing our current efforts as we seek to further expand the percentage of covered lives under contract. As we expand patient access in pulmonology and rheumatology, our patient mix has shifted more toward older patients, many of whom are covered by Medicare. Based on our commercial and contracting momentum and data results, we remain confident in our long-term normalized growth rate expectations for this product in the mid-single to low double-digit range.
In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 22%, reflecting both demand growth, favorable contracting and the extra week. We believe the recommendations for earlier and prolonged use of nitric oxide in joint guidelines recently published by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society are having a positive impact on use. Though unlikely to reach fiscal 2016 levels, we expect INOMAX will continue to see growth rates that are higher than historical norms for the next several quarters, with the return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates long term.
As I mentioned, in the quarter, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirmed the validity of multiple INOMAX drug and device patents, enhancing our confidence in the intellectual property estates surrounding INOMAX to at least 2031. But let me put INOMAX' performance into very human terms. This past year saw the highest annual consumption ever recorded for INOMAX. And in fiscal 2016, we estimate more than 10,000 critically ill neonates received INOMAX treatments. When you consider these instance and the children with infantile spasms who are treated with Acthar, it's no exaggeration to say that Mallinckrodt medicines are making a significant difference in the lives of families everyday.
I'm pleased to report we achieved 23% growth in revenue for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result once again of commercial execution, bolstered by recently published health economic data showing the potential for multimodal analgesia to shortened hospital stays for certain patients. Going forward, we expect these factors to continue to drive OFIRMEV growth. 
We're encouraged by the continued performance of Therakos as we completed our first full year post-acquisition, with net sales growth of 24% on a pro forma basis. We're continuing to refine our commercial model for Therakos to present the best value proposition for customers and further expand patient access. We're separately working urgently to resolve temporary production issues we've recently experienced with our third-party manufacturer for kits supporting the older XTS product. Though the XTS device is being discontinued over time, it still makes up a meaningful portion of our installed base.
We expect to report negative revenue for the product in the December quarter. And while it's possible the situation could continue into the second quarter of 2017, we believe our efforts to mitigate this kit shortage will successfully resolve the issue sooner. Overall, revenue impact from the shortage is expected to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the December and March quarters. Importantly, we believe we will be able to offset most of the earnings impact in the December quarter from strength in the rest of our businesses.
Closing out Specialty Brands, our hemostasis portfolio has continued to perform in line with our expectations. We're pleased to be launching PreveLeak and Raplixa. And like most hospital launches, we expect a slow but steady uptake. The longer-term, double-digit growth we expect over this portfolio's 2016 net sales figure will be driven by the launches of these new products.
Now let me share the latest developments in science and technology. A core tenet of our Acquire to Invest strategy is not only to focus science and technology resources on supporting key in-line products, but to also build out a robust organic pipeline in Specialty Brands, developing new indications and new products in areas where patients currently have few alternatives and need better options.
Last week, we shared the exciting news that we will launch a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Acthar in nearly 200 patients with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition with extremely limited treatment options today. Built on observations in the initial pilot safety trial, we worked closely with the FDA on the design of the new program. And we're very pleased that our investigational new drug application, or INDA, was awarded the agency's fast track designation. The ALS study will assess the effects of Acthar on established measures of disease symptoms and progression, enabling us to evaluate the potential benefit it may bring to patients with this devastating disease. We expect the trial to begin enrolling in 2017, and it will take several years to complete.
Also for Acthar, we recently noted the first patients treated in company-sponsored trials for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. With these 3 and the recently announced FSGS study, Mallinckrodt's initiation of company-sponsored, randomized, controlled Acthar clinical trials will result in the study of the drug in more than 800 patients, a significant advancement for this product. Since acquisition, committed investments in HEOR medical affairs and research efforts for Acthar, as well as the modernization of our manufacturing process, equate to more than $0.25 billion. And we expect continued robust investment into the drug to continue in the years ahead.
More broadly, over the course of fiscal 2016, we initiated 5 company-sponsored trials for other Specialty Brands products. Our strong science focus is also evident in the nearly 100 publications and data presentations generated this year, almost half of which related to Acthar. In other areas of our pipeline, we continued to advance the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, and enrollment in the trial is progressing as planned. We received FDA fast track designation for our INDA for the study of Synacthen Depot in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And are pleased to report the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers is ongoing, and we'll provide the necessary data to inform dose selection for patients entering Phase II. 
In the quarter, as I mentioned, we also announced and closed our acquisition of a regenerative medicine company focused on proprietary human skin substitute products. The lead developmental product is StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue, which had received orphan designation from the FDA. And we're preparing to start both the Phase III trial for the treatment of severe, deep partial thickness burns, and the Phase II trial for treatment of severe, full thickness burns. If approved, this product could transform the standard of burn treatment, and the broader platform has potential to provide wound healing for other types of skin injury as well.
Now let me touch briefly on business development. We continue to be very focused on optimizing our commercial and development portfolio in 3 ways: building and diversifying our Specialty Brands platforms with additional commercialized assets consistent with our Acquire to Invest strategy; executing on transactions that will expand our pipeline; and opportunistically identifying and adding ANDAs to support our Specialty Generics portfolio, such as the recently announced Intellipharmaceutics license agreement. We're assessing a growing list of attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and development, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials.

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. First, as a reminder, our Nuclear Imaging business has been reflected as a discontinued operation beginning in the September quarter, with each prior period recast to reflect this change. 
You've seen that the September quarterly results were strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales were $887 million, representing growth of 14%. September quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $633 million, representing growth of 36%, reflecting a specially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. 
Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter, with growth of 19% or $327 million in net sales, an all-time high even after adjusting for the additional selling week. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $127 million in net sales, a 22% increase. As Mark noted, we believe many of the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term.
Turning to OFIRMEV, we were pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, resulting in $76 million in net sales, a 23% increase. The Therakos business also performed well, with net sales of $55 million, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to Specialty Generics, which continues to be challenged by overall market conditions and increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $240 million, representing a 19% decline over the prior year quarter, and an 18% decline for the fiscal year. We expect this downward trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
Turning to methylphenidate ER specifically, we are pursuing the FDA's hearing process, and we'll submit necessary documentation by the recently extended due date of March 19, 2017. However, remember this is a product with high gross margins above our corporate average, and if withdrawn, it would have a significant near-term impact to our earnings. Regardless of the outcome of the FDA process, we anticipate newly announced AB rated competitive entrants to further reduce our market share upon the launch of those products. 
As it relates to 2017 for our Specialty Generics business, we continue to expect double-digit declines in revenues, even taking into account the impact of the extra week comparison. Fortunately, and as we have seen this past year, we anticipate our Specialty Brands businesses will help to mitigate the declines we foresee for Specialty Generics.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in the quarter to 75.3%. Due primarily to continued expected weakness in our Specialty Generics business, gross profit as a percentage of sales should be down sequentially over the next several quarters. R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was nearly 8%, with absolute spend increased over prior year and a higher concentration of total spend was devoted to further investment in Specialty Brands. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the September quarter was 15.7% compared to 16.2%, affected primarily by business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $141 million in the September quarter, bringing the total for the fiscal year to slightly over $1 billion. We have and will continue to focus on 3 capital allocation priorities: acquisitions, share repurchases and debt reduction. 
Notably, in fiscal 2016, we achieved the following: acquired the hemostasis portfolio in StrataGraft for a combined $245 million, repurchased a total of 651 million in shares and reduced debt by $470 million. Even with these actions, we ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $281 million and very manageable leverage, a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Note that the leverage ratio marginally increased from the prior quarter as it was unfavorably impacted by the move of Nuclear Imaging to discontinued operations, with no offsetting credit for the expected $574 million in upfront cash proceeds to be received when the transaction closes.
Looking ahead to 2017, you should expect to see continued strong cash generation, though the planned nuclear divestiture and weakness in Specialty Generics will put downward pressure on our cash flow as compared to 2016.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole who will take us into Q&A."

And as you mentioned, we now have our nuclear business in the -- in discontinued operations. So while our long-term objective is to have no single product account for more than 1/3 of our operating income, currently our concentration has increased a bit. And certainly, Acthar now represents a significantly greater proportion of our operating income than 1/3. Our objective, again, long term, is to continue to diversify our portfolio. And so looking for opportunities that would enable us to do that relatively rapidly is obviously high on our objective. We will continue to update the marketplace going forward as we identify additional opportunities to expand our commercial portfolio, as well as add to our development portfolio. So with regards to capital allocation, I think, certainly, business development, all else being equal, is a high priority for us. But you've seen, with the amount of cash flow that we have, that we've been able to do a number of different things with our capital, including business development, buy back shares and reduce debt. And we would look to continue to do opportunities, look to continue to manage our capital effectively based on what is most economically attractive. But certainly, diversifying our portfolio is very, very high in our list."

With regards to ANDA filings, again, we will continue to look to enhance our generics portfolio with additional ANDAs. We were pleased with the Intellipharmaceutics deal that we just recently signed. We'll continue to look for opportunities like those, as well as building out ANDAs from our own pipeline. But again, typically, since we're focused primarily in controlled substances, a relative number of ANDAs is going to be relatively smaller in any given amount of time.

So with regards to M&A, we're very pleased with the assets that we've been able to accumulate over time, with focus on, again, as you said, Annabel, highly durable assets, typically those that are under-resourced, typically those that have relatively low patient penetration, where the opportunity for long-term growth is driven predominantly by volume, particularly if we make some very focused investments as we've done with virtually all of the companies and products that we've acquired over time. We like specifically the hospital marketplace. We like the autoimmune and rare disease space, because we believe these areas of the pharmaceutical industry typically are going to offer those types of assets, and we think that's the appropriate strategy to continue to focus on going forward. Both of those areas are, of course, quite broad, which enables us to look for assets across a number of different therapeutic areas, and we think that focus is the right one going forward.

The fact that we have now nearly 60% of covered lives under some form of contract, given that 2 years ago, there were almost 0 lives under contract, is a really impressive performance. Let's just recognize though that signing contracts really doesn't guarantee you any business. What it does do is provide a vehicle so that you can promote broadly across your indication set, and gives you greater clarity longer term around market access in the commercial part of the business. It should be expected that a proportion of our businesses that is paid for by Medicare would increase given the fact that we are changing the mix of our business much more towards things like rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which typically affect older people. But overall, we're very pleased with the contracting approach. And Hugh, you may want to just add a couple of comments on how you see it going forward."

To Mark's point, we are pleased with what we've done, but we've put in place a strategy that allows us to capture the majority of our commercial lives under some form of contract with the first and foremost goal of trying to stabilize the reimbursement process or stabilize the marketplace, and we're pleased with what we've seen there. As it relates to the shift in the payer mix, you guys know the story, which is really about the growth of where the business is coming from. And some of that growth is being driven by -- most of that growth is being driven by new patients. And those new patients are predominantly coming from areas of more elderly patients in areas of rheumatology, nephrology and pulmonology. And when that shift occurs, we would expect Medicare, specifically, to grow as an overall proportion of our payer mix versus what has been done historically when the majority of our business was in more acute indications like neurology and MS flares. So there is nothing here that's happening that I think we were surprised by. I think we are optimistic that our payer engagement strategy, starting with the clinical story and the rationale behind the appropriate use of the product, is taking hold by both dealing with our commercial payers, as well as stabilizing the reimbursement landscape as our patients begin to evolve a little bit more towards the Medicare patient. So hopefully, that helps."

And when you heard us talked about in the prepared comments, this just this year alone, we've literally put out dozens of data sets for Acthar, the clinical data and health economic data, and that data that's been really driving a lot of the penetration in the business. With regards to the mix of payer, being in Medicare is just a natural result of the fact that the product mix is changing. You heard Hugh mention the fact that this business when we took it on a couple of years ago was predominantly a urology business, and now it's starting to evolve much more into a pulmonology and rheumatology business."

So when we think about appropriate patient penetration, we're talking about relatively small numbers of patients that are appropriate for the use of the product. And even at that, there are still significant opportunity for us to be able to penetrate those markets greater than where we've been to Mark's point earlier. Now when we think about Medicare, I want to make a comment about that. I think it's -- we don't view one payer channel easier than any other payer channel. I think the entire way we are thinking about this business is, by generating the appropriate health economic outcome research data, the appropriate clinical data, that the compelling story for Acthar will be such that those appropriate patients will be agreed upon between the payer and us and the clinician in how we actually promote the products. So we don't expect and we don't take for granted the Medicare channel. We actually work very hard in order to continue to position the product appropriately clinically, as well as from an perspective and the value associated with that. And as the mix continues to shift, as we launch more data and more indications, our expectation, this is a moving target. Payer mix does not stay static. It is dynamic. And as the portfolio shifts a little bit, we expect that that will change over time as well."

Can you talk a little bit more about -- you sounded a little bit more bullish than last quarter in terms of the duration of the higher than trends sort of growth you're expecting.

I'll go back to the initial discussion we just had about how we see the evolution of the business. We are always constantly trying to ensure that the evidence that we have for the appropriate use of the product holds true regardless of who the payer is. Now I think the Medicare component is one where, as you guys know, there are third-party insurers that interact with Part D that negotiates specifically with manufacturers. We continued to have those engagements about the appropriate clinical rational for the product and about the value equation for the product. We do like to see, obviously, a continued evidence generation and growth for the brand, whether it's commercial payers or Medicare payers. There is always risk inherent in action that payers could potentially take a bit against the product, whether it's Medicare or Medicaid or the commercial channel. But what's really important for us and what we feel optimistic about, and you've heard Mark mention it earlier in the work and partnership we do with our science colleagues, is the more data we can generate, the more evidence we can generate, the more appropriate use of the product that we agree with with the payers and have that position it appropriately, the more we can mitigate that risk. And that's appropriate for whether it's Medicare or commercial payers, and that's been our strategy all along."

Obviously, the growth rate all year has been significantly higher than historical growth rates. And we do see that growth rate likely to continue, albeit not necessarily at the rates that we've seen in 2016, but certainly higher than the mid-single-digit range that has been the historical situation. Driven by a couple of factors. One is certainly our contracting approach to the marketplace has been quite positive. But also, the fact that consumption has increased consumption, meaning utilization has increased. And we think a part of that is just the fact that the guidelines that support prolonged and earlier use of nitric oxide for the benefit of patients, the combined factors of those guidelines, plus our contracting strategy we think, is really driving this increased utilization, this increased volume utilization. And we would expect to see that continue over time, albeit as we said, longer-term, we would expect this business to revert back to more of a single digit, mid-single digit type growth business, but we think there'll be a tail in between what we've generated in 2016 and that kind of longer-term normalized growth rate."

Sumant, as you saw in the quarter, we were at 8%, and obviously, with all of the great activity we have going on in the science and technology group that Mark outlined in the prepared remarks earlier, our spend is going to increase in R&D over time, all of the ALS work, the muscular dystrophy, and, all of these activities are going to put further pressure on our R&D spend. And we're more than happy to reinvest in R&D to realize the future of the company. As it relates to free cash flow, a couple of things you need to be thinking about there. The first is, the fourth quarter, you'll see this in the 10-K when we file it, some people may think that the cash flow was a little bit low in the fourth quarter, but in the 10-K, you'll see that we paid cash taxes of $165 million in the quarter that impacted the number that we posted. I was very happy though on balance for the full year because, a year ago, when he said that we thought we generate about $1 billion in free cash flow, coming in $1.2 billion is pretty remarkable. No one could have pegged at that closely against that target, but obviously, we've been able to put that back to use on a multiple different ways. As it relates to capacity, we certainly have a lot of room, as I mentioned earlier. We are still in a very good position as it relates to our net debt leverage. Sumant, I encourage you to look at our website and see the calculation of the 3.6, with slight uptick from the third quarter, but really it's driven by the Nuclear business going out. So we have plenty of capacity. The highest we have taken, our net debt leverage was in the low 5s, but we still are generating a lot of cash, we still have roughly $600 million coming in from the Nuclear divestiture in the first half of the year. So I would say, we really don't feel constrained as it relates to doing business development. The big key is really finding something that fits all of our criteria."

So first, around just the targeting of our spend, it's roughly about 7% of our revenue, our projected revenues, but I don't think we're constrained by that. So what we're looking to do strategically, obviously, is to invest in the products that we acquire. So for instance, Acthar is a great example. Acthar is an older medicine. It had a lot of clinical experience, but it was actually rather short on more contemporary controlled trial data. So we're investing fairly heavily in Phase IV work across the major clinical conditions in which we promote: RA, lupus, for instance, and MS. We also, where we see opportunities to progress development opportunities and expand our pipeline activities for both Acthar and other in-line brands, as well as newer products, we're investing in those as well. So a good example with Acthar is the previous owners of the company and the product, had initiated a study in ALS, it was a safety study. And we looked at that -- those safety results, and we also did some post hoc analysis to get a better understanding of the potential value of the medicine to this particular condition. And remember, this is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition that leaves 70% or 80% of those afflicted dead within 5 years. So it's an area where really there is a tremendous amount of medical need. And we see what we believe is a signal of efficacy. Now we have to demonstrate that. So we're now moving forward and investing in a viable proof of concept trial that will allow us to definitively clarify whether there is value to Acthar in that particular population. So that's just an example. Now clearly, as we move forward, we want to build our organic pipeline, and you'll see greater investments. Perhaps, you'll see a shift in investments that include more pipeline products, for instance, the StrataGraft and ExpressGraft platforms that we recently acquired, the initiation of a trial for DND, muscular dystrophy for, and of course, the completion of our current registration trial in for a renal syndrome. So we're not constrained by that 7% or 8%. I'll certainly feel very happy going to market, and Matt is asking for more money, but we have to do it in a prioritized fashion and a strategic fashion, and they have to be valued investments."

We work very diligently with not only Medicare, but across all the payer mix, in order to ensure that patients can have access to the product and it's affordable appropriately for those patients. That pressure will continue, I think regardless of whether Acthar across all Specialty Brands as payers begin to look at how to best manage those large scale spend. But by generating the appropriate data and generating the right partnership and the right type of contractual agreements, we can hopefully mitigate some of that pressure and make sure the patients can get access to the product that are at affordable rate."

The majority of use for Acthar is usually in a kind of an episodic type role situation rather than a chronic. do have some patients that are on it chronically, but that tends to be a relatively small proportion. Most patients are episodic, meaning they might have an episode in a given year. It might be another year or 2 before they have another episode.

Before we begin, let me remind you of some important details. On the call, you'll hear us making some forward-looking statements, and it's possible that actual results could be materially different from our current expectations. Please note that we assume no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. We ask you to please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
We'll also provide some non-GAAP adjusted financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to GAAP is detailed in our earnings release and its related financial tables, which will be found in our website, mallinckrodt.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations pages of our website for such information. 
As noted in our press release, unless otherwise specified, all comparisons of quarterly or annual performance are to the fourth quarter or full year of fiscal 2015. In addition, the revenue growth ranges we'll be discussing today are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, the last quarter of 2016 included an extra selling week, a phenomenon that occurs once every 5 or 6 years with our 52, 53-week fiscal year accounting convention. While the exact quantification of the impact of the extra week is extremely difficult to determine, we believe it added approximately 6 to 9 percentage points to the quarterly sales growth rate of the company as a whole, and about 1 to 3 percentage points to our annual sales growth.
We're providing this estimated sales impact at the total Mallinckrodt level to give you context, but caution that you should not extrapolate it to any particular segment or product line as that may give you an inaccurate picture of our actual performance. 
For the September quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01, with full year fiscal 2016 GAAP earnings of $4.39. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings for the quarter came in at $2.04 per share and $7.85 per share for the full year fiscal year 2016.

As has been",2068,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another strong volume-driven quarter to end fiscal year 2016, even before the positive impact of the extra selling week. As has been the case all year, our robust performance across Specialty Brands has more than offset expected declines in Specialty Generics, which continued to face significant challenges. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to fulfill our strategic vision in the quarter, with additional transformation of our portfolio. For example, we announced the planned divestiture of our Nuclear Imaging business; achieved wins in INOMAX intellectual property that we believe will further extend the durability of this asset; enhanced our growing organic pipeline, with acquisition of an innovative development platform of regenerative medicine skin substitutes that have the potential to transform the standard of treatment for burns and wound healing; advanced our trials for terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and Synacthen Depot in the treatment of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and just last week, we announced the new trial for Acthar in treatment of ALS.
These accomplishments marked the beginning of our transition into what we see as the next exciting chapter of our long-term strategic road map for a sustainable success, driving in-line products, fostering innovation with investments in a growing organic pipeline, and providing new patients with access to powerful effective treatment.
In our Brands business, strong focus on execution drove our achievements, and provides a great example of our Acquire to Invest strategy in action. We generate new clinical and health economic evidence, and then ensure the data is shared with health care providers and payers to help them understand the value our therapies bring to patients and the health care system.
Net sales were up 14% and 16% for the September quarter and the year, respectively, led by steady volume increases and strong performance across the Specialty Brands segment, which, as a whole, was up 36% for the quarter and 42% for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 21% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This pattern of solid predominantly volume-based growth in Specialty Brands has been consistent over the past several quarters, and we see that trend continuing as we look ahead.
In Specialty Generics, which now represents less than 30% of our total net sales, the 19% decline in the quarter was consistent with our expectations. We've continued to project strong headwinds for this business for some time and expect significant downward pressure on the segment to persist. Having said that, the segment continues to generate cash. And we're focused on supplementing performance through careful cost management and select introduction of new ANDAs.
Regarding our methylphenidate ER product and the FDA's recent actions, we continue to disagree with the agency's position based on scientific grounds, and we believe it's not consistent with the best interest of patients. We're moving forward with the hearing process, and we're pleased the agency granted our request for a 90-day extension, allowing us to submit more robust documentation. The evidence we're compiling demonstrates why we believe our therapy should remain available to ADHD patients who can benefit from this cost-effective alternative. As the process moves forward, we'll provide updates as appropriate, and we will continuously -- we will continue to vigorously defend the safety and effectiveness of our drug.
Now let me give you some additional perspective on the key products in our Specialty Brands business. Acthar contributed another strong quarter, with net sales up 19% in the period, driven predominantly by volume. Obviously, we're very pleased, but note that absent the extra week, these results would have been more in line with our expected mid-single to low double-digit range. We saw continued growth particularly in rheumatology, pulmonology and nephrology. This strong volume growth continues in this quarter, consistent with what we've seen since the acquisition, propelled by our investments as well as commercial and medical affairs execution.
In rheumatology, we saw a steady prescription growth in both rheumatoid arthritis and in lupus, where we believe the published data on Acthar use continues to help physicians better understand the value it can provide to certain patients with these diseases. We're also seeing steady increases in pulmonology prescribing, as physicians absorbed recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. And we have redoubled our efforts in nephrology, helping us to continue to grow in that space.
Early feedback from our launch into ophthalmology is also promising, and we're dedicating resources to expand our efforts in this therapeutic area. In infantile spasms, intensified efforts to ensure that infants afflicted with this condition have access to Acthar brought consistent market share gains across the past several quarters. We're committed to further broadening and improving our reach to this fragile patient population.
We continue to advance our Acthar market access strategy and engage with key payers. Acthar now has nearly 60% of commercial lives under contract, and we see potential for more. We're continuing to find ways to partner with payers to improve appropriate patient access. Overall contract performance has aligned with our expectations, informing our current efforts as we seek to further expand the percentage of covered lives under contract. As we expand patient access in pulmonology and rheumatology, our patient mix has shifted more toward older patients, many of whom are covered by Medicare. Based on our commercial and contracting momentum and data results, we remain confident in our long-term normalized growth rate expectations for this product in the mid-single to low double-digit range.
In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 22%, reflecting both demand growth, favorable contracting and the extra week. We believe the recommendations for earlier and prolonged use of nitric oxide in joint guidelines recently published by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society are having a positive impact on use. Though unlikely to reach fiscal 2016 levels, we expect INOMAX will continue to see growth rates that are higher than historical norms for the next several quarters, with the return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates long term.
As I mentioned, in the quarter, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirmed the validity of multiple INOMAX drug and device patents, enhancing our confidence in the intellectual property estates surrounding INOMAX to at least 2031. But let me put INOMAX' performance into very human terms. This past year saw the highest annual consumption ever recorded for INOMAX. And in fiscal 2016, we estimate more than 10,000 critically ill neonates received INOMAX treatments. When you consider these instance and the children with infantile spasms who are treated with Acthar, it's no exaggeration to say that Mallinckrodt medicines are making a significant difference in the lives of families every day.
I'm pleased to report we achieved 23% growth in revenue for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result once again of commercial execution, bolstered by recently published health economic data showing the potential for multimodal analgesia to shortened hospital stays for certain patients. Going forward, we expect these factors to continue to drive OFIRMEV growth. 
We're encouraged by the continued performance of Therakos as we completed our first full year post-acquisition, with net sales growth of 24% on a pro forma basis. We're continuing to refine our commercial model for Therakos to present the best value proposition for customers and further expand patient access. We're separately working urgently to resolve temporary production issues we've recently experienced with our third-party manufacturer for kits supporting the older XTS product. Though the XTS device is being discontinued over time, it still makes up a meaningful portion of our installed base.
We expect to report negative revenue for the product in the December quarter. And while it's possible the situation could continue into the second quarter of 2017, we believe our efforts to mitigate this kit shortage will successfully resolve the issue sooner. Overall, revenue impact from the shortage is expected to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the December and March quarters. Importantly, we believe we will be able to offset most of the earnings impact in the December quarter from strength in the rest of our businesses.
Closing out Specialty Brands, our hemostasis portfolio has continued to perform in line with our expectations. We're pleased to be launching PreveLeak and Raplixa. And like most hospital launches, we expect a slow but steady uptake. The longer-term, double-digit growth we expect over this portfolio's 2016 net sales figure will be driven by the launches of these new products.
Now let me share the latest developments in science and technology. A core tenet of our Acquire to Invest strategy is not only to focus science and technology resources on supporting key in-line products, but to also build out a robust organic pipeline in Specialty Brands, developing new indications and new products in areas where patients currently have few alternatives and need better options.
Last week, we shared the exciting news that we will launch a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Acthar in nearly 200 patients with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition with extremely limited treatment options today. Built on observations in the initial pilot safety trial, we worked closely with the FDA on the design of the new program. And we're very pleased that our investigational new drug application, or INDA, was awarded the agency's fast track designation. The ALS study will assess the effects of Acthar on established measures of disease symptoms and progression, enabling us to evaluate the potential benefit it may bring to patients with this devastating disease. We expect the trial to begin enrolling in 2017, and it will take several years to complete.
Also for Acthar, we recently noted the first patients treated in company-sponsored trials for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. With these 3 and the recently announced FSGS study, Mallinckrodt's initiation of company-sponsored, randomized, controlled Acthar clinical trials will result in the study of the drug in more than 800 patients, a significant advancement for this product. Since acquisition, committed investments in HEOR medical affairs and research efforts for Acthar, as well as the modernization of our manufacturing process, equate to more than $0.25 billion. And we expect continued robust investment into the drug to continue in the years ahead.
More broadly, over the course of fiscal 2016, we initiated 5 company-sponsored trials for other Specialty Brands products. Our strong science focus is also evident in the nearly 100 publications and data presentations generated this year, almost half of which related to Acthar. In other areas of our pipeline, we continued to advance the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, and enrollment in the trial is progressing as planned. We received FDA fast track designation for our INDA for the study of Synacthen Depot in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And are pleased to report the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers is ongoing, and we'll provide the necessary data to inform dose selection for patients entering Phase II. 
In the quarter, as I mentioned, we also announced and closed our acquisition of a regenerative medicine company focused on proprietary human skin substitute products. The lead developmental product is StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue, which had received orphan designation from the FDA. And we're preparing to start both the Phase III trial for the treatment of severe, deep partial thickness burns, and the Phase II trial for treatment of severe, full thickness burns. If approved, this product could transform the standard of burn treatment, and the broader platform has potential to provide wound healing for other types of skin injury as well.
Now let me touch briefly on business development. We continue to be very focused on optimizing our commercial and development portfolio in 3 ways: building and diversifying our Specialty Brands platforms with additional commercialized assets consistent with our Acquire to Invest strategy; executing on transactions that will expand our pipeline; and opportunistically identifying and adding ANDAs to support our Specialty Generics portfolio, such as the recently announced Intellipharmaceutics license agreement. We're assessing a growing list of attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and development, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. First, as a reminder, our Nuclear Imaging business has been reflected as a discontinued operation beginning in the September quarter, with each prior period recast to reflect this change. 
You've seen that the September quarterly results were strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales were $887 million, representing growth of 14%. September quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $633 million, representing growth of 36%, reflecting a specially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. 
Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter, with growth of 19% or $327 million in net sales, an all-time high even after adjusting for the additional selling week. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $127 million in net sales, a 22% increase. As Mark noted, we believe many of the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term.
Turning to OFIRMEV, we were pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, resulting in $76 million in net sales, a 23% increase. The Therakos business also performed well, with net sales of $55 million, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to Specialty Generics, which continues to be challenged by overall market conditions and increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $240 million, representing a 19% decline over the prior year quarter, and an 18% decline for the fiscal year. We expect this downward trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
Turning to methylphenidate ER specifically, we are pursuing the FDA's hearing process, and we'll submit necessary documentation by the recently extended due date of March 19, 2017. However, remember this is a product with high gross margins above our corporate average, and if withdrawn, it would have a significant near-term impact to our earnings. Regardless of the outcome of the FDA process, we anticipate newly announced AB rated competitive entrants to further reduce our market share upon the launch of those products. 
As it relates to 2017 for our Specialty Generics business, we continue to expect double-digit declines in revenues, even taking into account the impact of the extra week comparison. Fortunately, and as we have seen this past year, we anticipate our Specialty Brands businesses will help to mitigate the declines we foresee for Specialty Generics.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in the quarter to 75.3%. Due primarily to continued expected weakness in our Specialty Generics business, gross profit as a percentage of sales should be down sequentially over the next several quarters. R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was nearly 8%, with absolute spend increased over prior year and a higher concentration of total spend was devoted to further investment in Specialty Brands. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the September quarter was 15.7% compared to 16.2%, affected primarily by business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $141 million in the September quarter, bringing the total for the fiscal year to slightly over $1 billion. We have and will continue to focus on 3 capital allocation priorities: acquisitions, share repurchases and debt reduction. 
Notably, in fiscal 2016, we achieved the following: acquired the hemostasis portfolio in StrataGraft for a combined $245 million, repurchased a total of 651 million in shares and reduced debt by $470 million. Even with these actions, we ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $281 million and very manageable leverage, a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Note that the leverage ratio marginally increased from the prior quarter as it was unfavorably impacted by the move of Nuclear Imaging to discontinued operations, with no offsetting credit for the expected $574 million in upfront cash proceeds to be received when the transaction closes.
Looking ahead to 2017, you should expect to see continued strong cash generation, though the planned Nuclear divestiture and weakness in Specialty Generics will put downward pressure on our cash flow as compared to 2016.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole who will take us into Q&A."

Acthar is doing great, but it continues to be a very controversial asset for The Street. I know you talked about a goal of reducing single-product exposure to less than 1/3 of the company's EBITDA over time. So my question here is, can you maybe update us, one, where you stand on concentration given the strong Acthar performance as well as some of the generic market pressures and imaging divestiture? And the second part is, how much of a priority or sense of urgency is there at the company to reduce this exposure at this point relative to other uses of capital, such as share repo, given where the stock is trading?"

Frankly, across our Specialty Brands portfolio, we've done very well. Really, all of our brands have done quite well, but Acthar has done a little bit better than we expected. And as you mentioned, we now have our Nuclear business in the -- in discontinued operations. So while our long-term objective is to have no single product account for more than 1/3 of our operating income, currently our concentration has increased a bit. And certainly, Acthar now represents a significantly greater proportion of our operating income than 1/3. Our objective, again, long term, is to continue to diversify our portfolio. And so looking for opportunities that would enable us to do that relatively rapidly is obviously high on our objective. We will continue to update the marketplace going forward as we identify additional opportunities to expand our commercial portfolio, as well as add to our development portfolio. So with regards to capital allocation, I think, certainly, business development, all else being equal, is a high priority for us. But you've seen, with the amount of cash flow that we have, that we've been able to do a number of different things with our capital, including business development, buy back shares and reduce debt. And we would look to continue to do opportunities, look to continue to manage our capital effectively based on what is most economically attractive.

So with regards to M&A, we're very pleased with the assets that we've been able to accumulate over time, with focus on, again, as you said, Annabel, highly durable assets, typically those that are under-resourced, typically those that have relatively low patient penetration, where the opportunity for long-term growth is driven predominantly by volume, particularly if we make some very focused investments as we've done with virtually all of the companies and products that we've acquired over time. We like specifically the hospital marketplace. We like the autoimmune and rare disease space, because we believe these areas of the pharmaceutical industry typically are going to offer those types of assets, and we think that's the appropriate strategy to continue to focus on going forward. Both of those areas are, of course, quite broad, which enables us to look for assets across a number of different therapeutic areas, and we think that focus is the right one going forward. With regards to generics, again, our long-term view is that this is a very solid cash generation business for us, one that's certainly helped diversify our portfolio, as well as fund some of the additional M&A that we're doing.

The fact that we have now nearly 60% of covered lives under some form of contract, given that 2 years ago, there were almost 0 lives under contract, is a really impressive performance. Let's just recognize though that signing contracts really doesn't guarantee you any business. What it does do is provide a vehicle so that you can promote broadly across your indication set, and gives you greater clarity longer term around market access in the commercial part of the business. It should be expected that a proportion of our businesses that is paid for by Medicare would increase given the fact that we are changing the mix of our business much more towards things like rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which typically affect older people. But overall, we're very pleased with the contracting approach. And Hugh, you may want to just add a couple of comments on how you see it going forward."

So I want to add a few points on it. I think it's important to keep in mind where we started. When we began with this product, we reengaged payers, we engaged payers for the first time, and that took some period of time. To Mark's point, we are pleased with what we've done, but we've put in place a strategy that allows us to capture the majority of our commercial lives under some form of contract with the first and foremost goal of trying to stabilize the reimbursement process or stabilize the marketplace, and we're pleased with what we've seen there. As it relates to the shift in the payer mix, you guys know the story, which is really about the growth of where the business is coming from. And some of that growth is being driven by -- most of that growth is being driven by new patients. And those new patients are predominantly coming from areas of more elderly patients in areas of rheumatology, nephrology and pulmonology. And when that shift occurs, we would expect Medicare, specifically, to grow as an overall proportion of our payer mix versus what has been done historically when the majority of our business was in more acute indications like neurology and MS flares. So there's nothing here that's happening, I think, that we were surprised by. I think we are optimistic that our payer engagement strategy, starting with the clinical story and the rationale behind the appropriate use of the product, is taking hold by both dealing with our commercial payers as well as stabilizing the reimbursement landscape as our patients begin to evolve a little bit more towards the Medicare patient. So hopefully that helps."

If we think about some of the newer indications like RA, lupus, pulmonary sarcoidosis, these are areas, 2 years ago, where the patient penetration rates were less than 1%. And we're clearly seeing gains in penetration in those areas, predominantly on the basis of new data generation. I mean, you heard us talk about it in the prepared comments, just this year alone, we've literally put out dozens of data sets for Acthar, clinical data and health economic data, and it's that data that's been really driving a lot of the penetration in the business. With regards to the mix of payer, being in Medicare is just a natural result of the fact that the product mix is changing.

When we look at -- it's always important to keep in context the patient populations that we're thinking about when we think about the use of Acthar and the appropriate use of Acthar. So this is usually a third or fourth line treatment. These are sicker patients who have failed on multiple therapeutic options. So when we think about appropriate patient penetration, we're talking about relatively small numbers of patients that are appropriate for the use of the product. And even at that, there are still significant opportunity for us to be able to penetrate those markets greater than where we've been to Mark's point earlier. Now when we think about Medicare, I want to make a comment about that. I think it's -- we don't view one payer channel easier than any other payer channel. I think the entire way we're thinking about this business is by generating the appropriate health economic outcome, research data, the appropriate clinical data, that the compelling story for Acthar will be such that those appropriate patients will be agreed upon between the payer and us and the clinician in how we actually promote the product. So we don't expect and we don't take for granted the Medicare channel. We actually work very hard in order to continue to position the product appropriately clinically, as well as from an HEOR perspective and the value associated with that. And as the mix continues to shift, as we launch more data and more indications, our expectation, this is a moving target. Payer mix does not stay static. It is dynamic. And as the portfolio shifts a little bit, we expect that, that will change over time as well."

I'd go back to the initial discussion we just had about how we see the evolution of the business. We are always constantly trying to ensure that the evidence that we have for the appropriate use of the product holds true regardless of who the payer is. Now I think the Medicare component is one where, as you guys know, there are third-party insurers that interact to Part D that negotiates specifically with manufacturers. We continue to have those engagements about the appropriate clinical rationale for the product and about the value equation for the product. We do like to see, obviously, continued evidence generation and growth for the brand, whether it's commercial payers or Medicare payers. There is always risk inherent in the action that payers could potentially take a bit against the product, whether it's Medicare or Medicaid or the commercial channel. But what's really important for us and what we feel optimistic about, and you've heard Mark mention it earlier in the work and the partnership we're doing with our science colleagues, is the more data we can generate, the more evidence we can generate, the more appropriate use of the product that we agree with, with the payers and how to position it appropriately, the more we can mitigate that risk. And that's appropriate for whether it's Medicare or commercial payers, and that's been our strategy all along."

Obviously, the growth rate all year has been significantly higher than historical growth rates. And we do see that growth rate likely to continue, albeit not necessarily at the rates that we've seen in 2016, but certainly higher than the mid-single-digit range that has been the historical situation driven by a couple of factors. One is certainly our contracting approach to the marketplace has been quite positive. But also, the fact that consumption has increased consumption, meaning utilization has increased. And we think a part of that is just the fact that the guidelines that support prolonged and earlier use of nitric oxide for the benefit of patients, the combined factors of those guidelines, plus our contracting strategy, we think, is really driving this increased utilization, this increased volume utilization. And we would expect to see that continue over time, albeit as we've said, longer term, we would expect this business to revert back to more of a single digit -- mid-single digit type growth business, but we think there'll be a tail in between what we've generated in 2016 and that kind of longer-term normalized growth rate."

I'll start and then maybe Dr. Romano would like to talk about how he sees R&D spending as a percent of sales. Sumant, as you saw in the quarter, we were at 8%. And obviously, with all of the great activity we have going on in the science and technology group that Mark outlined in the prepared remarks earlier, our spend is going to increase in R&D over time. All of the ALS work, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy, terlipressin, StrataGraft, all of these activities are going to put further pressure on our R&D spend. And we're more than happy to reinvest in R&D to realize the future of the company. As it relates to free cash flow, a couple of things you need to be thinking about there. The first is, the fourth quarter, you'll see this in the 10-K when we file it, some people may think that the cash flow was a little bit low in the fourth quarter, but in the 10-K, you'll see that we paid cash taxes of $165 million in the quarter that impacted the number that we posted. I was very happy though on balance for the full year, because a year ago, when he said that we thought we'd generate about $1 billion in free cash flow, coming in at $1.2 billion is pretty remarkable. No one could have pegged it that closely against that target, but obviously we've been able to put that back to use on multiple different ways. As it relates to capacity, we certainly have a lot of room, as I mentioned earlier. We are still in a very good position as it relates to our net debt leverage, Sumant. I encourage you to look at our website and see the calculation of the 3.6, with slight uptick from the third quarter, but really it's driven by the Nuclear business going out. So we have plenty of capacity. The highest we've taken, our net debt leverage was in the low 5s. But we still are generating a lot of cash, we still have roughly $600 million coming in from the Nuclear divestiture in the first half of the year. So I would say, we really don't feel constrained as it relates to doing business development. The big key is really finding something that fits all of our criteria."

So first around just the targeting of our spend, it's roughly about 7% of our revenue, our projected revenues. But I don't think we're constrained by that. So what we're looking to do strategically, obviously, is to invest in the products that we acquire. So for instance, Acthar is a great example. Acthar is an older medicine. It had a lot of clinical experience, but it was actually rather short on more contemporary controlled trial data. So we're investing fairly heavily in Phase IV work across the major clinical conditions in which we promote: RA; lupus, for instance; and MS. We also -- where we see opportunities to progress development opportunities and expand our pipeline activities for both Acthar and other in-line brands as well as newer products, we're investing in those as well. So a good example with Acthar is the previous owners of the company and the product, Questcor, had initiated a study in ALS. It was a safety study. And we looked at that -- those safety results, and we also did some post-hoc analysis to get a better understanding of the potential value of the medicine to this particular condition. And remember, this is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition that leaves 70% or 80% of those afflicted dead within 5 years. So it's an area where really there is a tremendous amount of medical need. And we see what we believe is a signal of potential efficacy. Now we have to demonstrate that. So we're now moving forward and investing in a viable proof of concept trial that will allow us to definitively clarify whether there's value to Acthar in that particular population. So that's just an example. Now clearly, as we move forward, we want to build our organic pipeline. And you'll see greater investments, perhaps you'll see a shift in investments that include more pipeline products. For instance, the StrataGraft and ExpressGraft platforms that we recently acquired; the initiation of a trial for DMD, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, for Synacthen; and of course, the completion of our current registration trial in terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. So we're not constrained by that 7% or 8%. I'll certainly feel very happy going to both Mark and Matt and asking for more money, but we have to do it in a prioritized fashion, in a strategic fashion and they have to be valued investments."

We work very diligently with not only Medicare, but across all the payer mix, in order to ensure that patients can have access to the product and it's affordable appropriately for those patients. That pressure will continue, I think, regardless of whether it's Acthar across all Specialty Brands, as payers begin to look at how to best manage those large-scale spends. But by generating the appropriate data and generating the right partnership and the right type of contractual agreements, we can hopefully mitigate some of that pressure and make sure the patients can get access to the product at an affordable rate."

The majority of use for Acthar is usually in that kind of an episodic type role situation rather than a chronic.

It might be another year or 2 before they have another episode. So again, this is not necessarily something where the expense to the patient is the same every year. In fact, it's predominantly in this episodic category."

Mark will start us off with some brief comments, then Matt will follow providing details on our financials. We'll then go to our customary Q&A session. 
Before we begin, let me remind you of some important details. On the call, you'll hear us making some forward-looking statements and it's possible that actual results could be materially different from our current expectations. Please note that we assume no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. We ask you to please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
We'll also provide some non-GAAP adjusted financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to GAAP is detailed in our earnings release and its related financial tables, which can be found in our website, mallinckrodt.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations pages of our website for such information. 
As noted in our press release, unless otherwise specified, all comparisons of quarterly or annual performance are to the fourth quarter or full year of fiscal 2015. In addition, the revenue growth ranges we'll be discussing today are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, the last quarter of 2016 included an extra selling week, a phenomenon that occurs once every 5 or 6 years with our 52, 53-week fiscal year accounting convention. While the exact quantification of the impact of the extra week is extremely difficult to determine, we believe it added approximately 6 to 9 percentage points to the quarterly sales growth rate of the company as a whole, and about 1 to 3 percentage points to our annual sales growth.
We're providing this estimated sales impact at the total Mallinckrodt level to give you context, but caution that you should not extrapolate it to any particular segment or product line as that may give you an inaccurate picture of our actual performance. 
For the September quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01, with full-year fiscal 2016 GAAP earnings of $4.39. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings for the quarter came in at $2.04 per share and $7.85 per share for the full-year fiscal year 2016.

As has been",2064,"Thanks, Cole, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. 
I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another strong volume-driven quarter to end fiscal-year 2016, even before the positive impact of the extra selling week. As has been the case all year, our robust performance across Specialty Brands has more than offset expected declines in Specialty Generics, which continues to face significant challenges. Perhaps most importantly, we continued to fulfill our strategic vision in the quarter, with additional transformation of our portfolio. For example, we announced the planned divestiture of our Nuclear Imaging business, achieved wins in INOMAX intellectual property that we believe will further extend the durability of this asset; enhanced our growing organic pipeline, with acquisition of an innovative development platform of regenerative medicine skin substitutes that have the potential to transform the standard of treatment for burns and wound healing, advanced our trials for terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and Synacthen Depot in the treatment of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy and just last week we announced the new trial for Acthar in treatment of ALS.
These accomplishments marked the beginning of our transition into what we see as the next exciting chapter of our long-term strategic road map for sustainable success, driving in-line products, fostering innovation with investments in a growing organic pipeline and providing new patients with access to powerful effective treatment.
In our Brands business, strong focus on execution drove our achievements, and provides a great example of our Acquire to Invest strategy in action. We generate new clinical and health economic evidence, and then ensure the data is shared with health care providers and payers to help them understand the value our therapies bring to patients and the health care system.
Net sales were up 14% and 16% for the September quarter and the year, respectively, led by steady volume increases and strong performance across the Specialty Brands segment, which, as a whole, was up 36% for the quarter and 42% for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 21% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This pattern of solid, predominantly volume-based growth in Specialty Brands has been consistent over the past several quarters and we see that trend continuing as we look ahead.
In Specialty Generics, which now represents less than 30% of our total net sales, the 19% decline in the quarter was consistent with our expectations. We've continued to project strong headwinds for this business for some time and expect significant downward pressure on the segment to persist. Having said that, the segment continues to generate cash. And we're focused on supplementing performance through careful cost management and select introduction of new ANDAs.
Regarding our methylphenidate ER product and the FDA's recent actions, we continue to disagree with the agency's position, based on scientific grounds, and we believe it's not consistent with the best interest of patients. We're moving forward with the hearing process, and we're pleased the agency granted our request for a 90-day extension, allowing us to submit more robust documentation. The evidence we're compiling demonstrates why we believe our therapy should remain available to ADHD patients who can benefit from this cost-effective alternative. As the process moves forward, we'll provide updates as appropriate, and we will continuously -- we will continue to vigorously defend the safety and effectiveness of our drug.
Now let me give you some additional perspective on the key products in our Specialty Brands business. Acthar contributed another strong quarter, with net sales up 19% in the period, driven predominantly by volume. Obviously, we're very pleased, but note that absent the extra week, these results would have been more in line with our expected mid-single to low double-digit range. We saw continued growth particularly in rheumatology, pulmonology and nephrology. This strong volume growth continues in this quarter, consistent with what we've seen since acquisition, propelled by our investments as well as commercial and medical affairs execution.
In rheumatology, we saw a steady prescription growth in both rheumatoid arthritis and in lupus, where we believe the published data on Acthar use continues to help physicians better understand the value it can provide to certain patients with these diseases. We're also seeing steady increases in pulmonology prescribing, as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. And we've redoubled our efforts in nephrology, helping us to continue to grow in that space.
Early feedback from our launch into ophthalmology is also promising, and we're dedicating resources to expand our efforts in this therapeutic area.
In infantile spasms, intensified efforts to ensure that infants afflicted with this condition have access to Acthar brought consistent market share gains across the past several quarters. We're committed to further broadening and improving our reach to this fragile patient population.
We continue to advance our Acthar market access strategy and engage with key payers. Acthar now has nearly 60% of commercial lives under contract, and we see potential for more. We're continuing to find ways to partner with payers to improve appropriate patient access. Overall contract performance has aligned with our expectations, informing our current efforts as we seek to further expand the percentage of covered lives under contract. As we expand patient access in pulmonology and rheumatology, our patient mix has shifted more toward older patients, many of whom are covered by Medicare. Based on our commercial and contracting momentum and data results, we remain confident in our long-term normalized growth rate expectations for this product in the mid-single to low double-digit range.
In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 22%, reflecting both demand growth, favorable contracting and the extra week. We believe the recommendations for earlier and prolonged use of nitric oxide in joint guidelines recently published by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society are having a positive impact on use. Though unlikely to reach fiscal 2016 levels, we expect INOMAX will continue to see growth rates that are higher than historical norms for the next several quarters, with a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates long term.
As I mentioned, in the quarter, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirmed the validity of multiple INOMAX drug and device patents, enhancing our confidence in the intellectual property estates surrounding INOMAX to at least 2031. But let me put INOMAX' performance into very human terms. This past year saw the highest annual consumption ever recorded for INOMAX. And in fiscal 2016, we estimate more than 10,000 critically ill neonates received INOMAX treatments. When you consider these instance and the children with infantile spasms who are treated with Acthar, it's no exaggeration to say that Mallinckrodt medicines are making a significant difference in the lives of families every day.
I'm pleased to report we achieved 23% growth in revenue for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result once again of commercial execution, bolstered by recently published health economic data showing the potential for multimodal analgesia to shortened hospital stays for certain patients. Going forward, we expect these factors to continue to drive OFIRMEV growth. 
We're encouraged by the continued performance of Therakos as we completed our first full year post-acquisition, with net sales growth of 24% on a pro forma basis. We're continuing to refine our commercial model for Therakos to present the best value proposition for customers and further expand patient access. We're separately working urgently to resolve temporary production issues we've recently experienced with our third-party manufacturer for kits supporting the older XTS product. Though the XTS device is being discontinued over time, it still makes up a meaningful portion of our installed base.
We expect to report negative revenue for the product in the December quarter. And while it's possible the situation could continue into the second quarter of 2017, we believe our efforts to mitigate this kit shortage will successfully resolve the issue sooner. Overall, revenue impact from the shortage is expected to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the December and March quarters. Importantly, we believe we will be able to offset most of the earnings impact in the December quarter from strength in the rest of our businesses.
Closing out Specialty Brands, our hemostasis portfolio has continued to perform in line with our expectations. We're pleased to be launching PreveLeak and Raplixa, and like most hospital launches, we expect a slow but steady uptake. The longer-term, double-digit growth we expect over this portfolio's 2016 net sales figure will be driven by the launches of these new products.
Now let me share the latest developments in science and technology. A core tenet of our Acquire to Invest strategy is not only to focus science and technology resources on supporting key in-line products, but to also build out a robust organic pipeline in Specialty Brands, developing new indications and new products in areas where patients currently have few alternatives and need better options.
Last week, we shared the exciting news that we will launch a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Acthar in nearly 200 patients with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition with extremely limited treatment options today. Built on observations in the initial pilot safety trial, we worked closely with the FDA on the design of the new program, and we're very pleased that our investigational new drug application, or INDA, was awarded the agency's fast track designation. The ALS study will assess the effects of Acthar on established measures of disease symptoms and progression, enabling us to evaluate the potential benefit it may bring to patients with this devastating disease. We expect the trial to begin enrolling in 2017, and it will take several years to complete.
Also for Acthar, we recently noted the first patients treated in company-sponsored trials for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. With these 3 and the recently announced FSGS study, Mallinckrodt's initiation of company-sponsored, randomized, controlled Acthar clinical trials will result in the study of the drug in more than 800 patients, a significant advancement for this product. Since acquisition, committed investments in HEOR medical affairs and research efforts for Acthar as well as the modernization of our manufacturing process equate to more than $0.25 billion. And we expect continued robust investment into the drug to continue in the years ahead.
More broadly, over the course of fiscal 2016, we initiated 5 company-sponsored trials for other Specialty Brands products. Our strong science focus is also evident in the nearly 100 publications and data presentations generated this year, almost half of which related to Acthar. In other areas of our pipeline, we continued to advance the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, and enrollment in the trial is progressing as planned. We received FDA fast track designation for our INDA for the study of Synacthen Depot in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and are pleased to report the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers is ongoing, and we'll provide the necessary data to inform dose selection for patients entering Phase II. 
In the quarter, as I mentioned, we also announced and closed our acquisition of a regenerative medicine company focused on proprietary human skin substitute products. The lead developmental product is StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue, which had received orphan designation from the FDA. And we're preparing to start both the Phase III trial for the treatment of severe, deep partial thickness burns, and the Phase II trial for treatment of severe, full thickness burns. If approved, this product could transform the standard of burn treatment, and the broader platform has potential to provide wound healing for other types of skin injury as well.
Now let me touch briefly on business development. We continue to be very focused on optimizing our commercial and development portfolio in 3 ways: building and diversifying our Specialty Brands platforms with additional commercialized assets consistent with our Acquire to Invest strategy; executing on transactions that will expand our pipeline; and opportunistically identifying and adding ANDAs to support our Specialty Generics portfolio, such as the recently announced Intellipharmaceutics license agreement. We're assessing a growing list of attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and development, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. First, as a reminder, our Nuclear Imaging business has been reflected as a discontinued operation beginning in the September quarter, with each prior period recast to reflect this change. 
You've seen that the September quarterly results were strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales were $887 million, representing growth of 14%. September quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $633 million, representing growth of 36%, reflecting a specially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. 
Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter, with growth of 19% or $327 million in net sales, an all-time high even after adjusting for the additional selling week. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $127 million in net sales, a 22% increase. As Mark noted, we believe many of the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term.
Turning to OFIRMEV, we were pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, resulting in $76 million in net sales, a 23% increase. The Therakos business also performed well, with net sales of $55 million, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to Specialty Generics, which continues to be challenged by overall market conditions and increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $240 million, representing a 19% decline over the prior year quarter, and an 18% decline for the fiscal year. We expect this downward trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
Turning to methylphenidate ER specifically, we are pursuing the FDA's hearing process, and we'll submit necessary documentation by the recently extended due date of March 19, 2017. However, remember this is a product with high gross margins above our corporate average, and if withdrawn, it would have a significant near-term impact to our earnings. Regardless of the outcome of the FDA process, we anticipate newly announced AB rated competitive entrants to further reduce our market share upon the launch of those products. 
As it relates to 2017 for our Specialty Generics business, we continue to expect double-digit declines in revenues, even taking into account the impact of the extra week comparison. Fortunately, and as we have seen this past year, we anticipate our Specialty Brands businesses will help to mitigate the declines we foresee for Specialty Generics.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in the quarter to 75.3%. Due primarily to continued expected weakness in our Specialty Generics business, gross profit as a percentage of sales should be down sequentially over the next several quarters. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was nearly 8%, with absolute spend increased over prior year and a higher concentration of total spend was devoted to further investment in Specialty Brands. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the September quarter was 15.7% compared to 16.2%, affected primarily by business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $141 million in the September quarter, bringing the total for the fiscal year to slightly over $1 billion. We have and will continue to focus on 3 capital allocation priorities: acquisitions, share repurchases and debt reduction. 
Notably, in fiscal 2016, we achieved the following: acquired the hemostasis portfolio in StrataGraft for a combined $245 million, repurchased a total of 651 million in shares and reduced debt by $470 million. Even with these actions, we ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $281 million and very manageable leverage, a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Note that the leverage ratio marginally increased from the prior quarter as it was unfavorably impacted by the move of Nuclear Imaging to discontinued operations, with no offsetting credit for the expected $574 million in upfront cash proceeds to be received when the transaction closes.
Looking ahead to 2017, you should expect to see continued strong cash generation, though the planned Nuclear divestiture and weakness in Specialty Generics will put downward pressure on our free cash flow as compared to 2016.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole who will take us into Q&A."

And as you mentioned, we now have our Nuclear business in the -- in discontinued operations. So while our long-term objective is to have no single product account for more than 1/3 of our operating income, currently our concentration has increased a bit. And certainly, Acthar now represents a significantly greater proportion of our operating income than 1/3. Our objective, again, long term, is to continue to diversify our portfolio. And so looking for opportunities that would enable us to do that relatively rapidly is obviously high on our objective. We will continue to update the marketplace going forward as we identify additional opportunities to expand our commercial portfolio as well as add to our development portfolio. So with regards to capital allocation, I think, certainly business development, all else being equal, is a high priority for us. But you've seen, with the amount of cash flow that we have, that we've been able to do a number of different things with our capital, including business development, buy back shares and reduce debt.

With regards to how long the product would continue to stay in the market, certainly our objective would be to have data to support our position that the product should remain on the market, but that will be determined based on what the FDA decides once they see our data package when we present it in March of next year. With regards to ANDA filings, again, we will continue to look to enhance our generics portfolio with additional ANDAs. We were pleased with the Intellipharmaceutics deal that we just recently signed. We'll continue to look for opportunities like those, as well as building out ANDAs from our own pipeline. But again, typically, since we're focused primarily in controlled substances, a relative number of ANDAs is going to be relatively smaller in any given amount of time.

So with regards to M&A, we're very pleased with the assets that we've been able to accumulate over time, with focus on, again, as you said, Annabel, highly durable assets, typically those that are under-resourced, typically those that have relatively low patient penetration, where the opportunity for long-term growth is driven predominantly by volume, particularly if we make some very focused investments as we've done with virtually all of the companies and products that we've acquired over time. We like specifically the hospital marketplace. We like the autoimmune and rare disease space, because we believe these areas of the pharmaceutical industry typically are going to offer those types of assets, and we think that's the appropriate strategy to continue to focus on going forward. Both of those areas are, of course, quite broad, which enables us to look for assets across a number of different therapeutic areas and we think that focus is the right one going forward. With regards to generics, again, our long-term view is that this is a very solid cash generation business for us, one that's certainly helped diversify our portfolio as well as fund some of the additional M&A that we're doing.

The fact that we have now nearly 60% of covered lives under some form of contract, given that 2 years ago, there were almost 0 lives under contract, is a really impressive performance. Let's just recognize though that signing contracts really doesn't guarantee you any business. What it does do is provide a vehicle so that you can promote broadly across your indication set, and gives you greater clarity longer term around market access in the commercial part of the business. It should be expected that the proportion of our businesses that is paid for by Medicare would increase given the fact that we are changing the mix of our business much more towards things like rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which typically affect older people. But overall, we're very pleased with the contracting approach. And Hugh, you may want to just add a couple of comments on how you see it going forward."

So I want to add a few points on this. I think it's important to keep in mind where we started. When we began with this product, we reengaged payers, we engaged payers for the first time, and that took some period of time. To Mark's point, we are pleased with what we've done, but we've put in place a strategy that allows us to capture the majority of our commercial lives under some form of contract with the first and foremost goal of trying to stabilize the reimbursement process and stabilize the marketplace.  We're pleased with what we've seen there. As it relates to the shift in the payer mix, you guys know the story, which is really about the growth of where the business is coming from. And some of that growth is being driven by -- most of that growth is being driven by new patients. And those new patients are predominantly coming from areas of more elderly patients in areas of rheumatology, nephrology and pulmonology. And when that shift occurs, we would expect Medicare, specifically, to grow as an overall proportion of our payer mix versus what has been done historically when the majority of our business was in more acute indications like neurology and MS flares. So there's nothing here that's happening, I think, that we were surprised by. I think we are optimistic that our payer engagement strategy, starting with the clinical story and the rationale behind the appropriate use of the product, is taking hold by both dealing with our commercial payers as well as stabilizing the reimbursement landscape as our patients begin to evolve a little bit more towards the Medicare patient. So hopefully that helps."

If we think about some of the newer indications like RA, lupus, pulmonary sarcoidosis, these are areas where, 2 years ago, where the patient penetration rates were less than 1%. And we're clearly seeing gains in penetration in those areas, predominantly on the basis of new data generation. I mean, you heard us talk about it in the prepared comments, just this year alone, we've literally put out dozens of data sets for Acthar, clinical data and health economic data, and it's that data that's been really driving a lot of the penetration in the business. With regards to the mix of payer, being in Medicare is just a natural result of the fact that the product mix is changing.

When we look at -- it's always important to keep in context the patient populations that we're thinking about when we think about the use of Acthar and the appropriate use of Acthar. So this is usually a third or fourth line treatment. These are sicker patients who have failed on multiple therapeutic options. So when we think about appropriate patient penetration, we're talking about relatively small numbers of patients that are appropriate for the use of the product. And even at that, there are still significant opportunity for us to be able to penetrate those markets greater than where we've been, to Mark's point earlier. Now when we think about Medicare, I want to make a comment about that. I think it's -- we don't view one payer channel easier than any other payer channel. I think the entire way we're thinking about this business is by generating the appropriate health economic outcome, research data, the appropriate clinical data, that the compelling story for Acthar will be such that those appropriate patients will be agreed upon between the payer and us and the clinician in how we actually promote the product. So we don't expect and we don't take for granted the Medicare channel. We actually work very hard in order to continue to position the product appropriately clinically, as well as from an HEOR perspective and the value associated with that. And as the mix continues to shift, as we launch more data and more indications, our expectation, this is a moving target. Payer mix does not stay static. It is dynamic. And as the portfolio shifts a little bit, we expect that, that will change over time as well."

I'd go back to the initial discussion we just had about how we see the evolution of the business. We are always constantly trying to ensure that the evidence that we have for the appropriate use of the product holds true regardless of who the payer is. Now I think the Medicare component is one where, as you guys know, there are third-party insurers that interact to Part D that negotiates specifically with manufacturers. We continue to have those engagements about the appropriate clinical rationale for the product and about the value equation for the product. We do like to see, obviously, continued evidence generation and growth for the brand, whether it's commercial payers or Medicare payers. There is always risk inherent in the action that payers could potentially take a bit against the product, whether it's Medicare or Medicaid or the commercial channel. But what's really important for us and what we feel optimistic about, and you've heard Mark mention it earlier in the work and the partnership we're doing with our science colleagues, is the more data we can generate, the more evidence we can generate, the more appropriate use of the product that we agree with, with the payers and how to position it appropriately, the more we can mitigate that risk.

Obviously, the growth rate all year has been significantly higher than historical growth rates. And we do see that growth rate likely to continue, albeit not necessarily at the rates that we've seen in 2016, but certainly higher than the mid-single-digit range that has been the historical situation driven by a couple of factors. One is certainly our contracting approach to the marketplace has been quite positive. But also, the fact that consumption has increased consumption, meaning utilization has increased. And we think part of that is just the fact that the guidelines that support prolonged and earlier use of nitric oxide for the benefit of patients, the combined factors of those guidelines, plus our contracting strategy, we think, is really driving this increased utilization, this increased volume utilization. And we would expect to see that continue over time, albeit as we've said, longer term, we would expect this business to revert back to more of a single digit -- mid-single digit type growth business, but we think there'll be a tail in between what we've generated in 2016 and that kind of longer-term normalized growth rate."

I'll start and then maybe Dr. Romano would like to talk about how he sees R&D spending as a percent of sales. Sumant, as you saw in the quarter, we were at 8%. And obviously, with all of the great activity we have going on in the science and technology group that Mark outlined in the prepared remarks earlier, our spend is going to increase in R&D over time. All of the ALS work, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy, terlipressin, StrataGraft, all of these activities are going to put further pressure on our R&D spend. And we're more than happy to reinvest in R&D to realize the future of the company. As it relates to free cash flow, a couple of things you need to be thinking about there. The first is, the fourth quarter, you'll see this in the 10-K when we file it, some people may think that the cash flow was a little bit low in the fourth quarter, but in the 10-K, you'll see that we paid cash taxes of $165 million in the quarter that impacted the number that we posted. I was very happy though on balance for the full year, because a year ago, when we said that we thought we'd generate about $1 billion in free cash flow, coming in at $1.2 billion is pretty remarkable. No one could have pegged it that closely against that target, but obviously we've been able to put that back to use on multiple different ways. As it relates to capacity, we certainly have a lot of room.  As I mentioned earlier, we are still in a very good position as it relates to our net debt leverage, Sumant. I encourage you to look at our website and see the calculation of the 3.6, with slight uptick from the third quarter, but really it's driven by the Nuclear business going out. So we have plenty of capacity. The highest we've taken our net debt leverage was in the low 5s. But we still are generating a lot of cash, we still have roughly $600 million coming in from the Nuclear divestiture in the first half of the year. So I would say, we really don't feel constrained as it relates to doing business development. The big key is really finding something that fits all of our criteria."

So first around just the targeting of our spend, it's roughly about 7% of our revenue -- projected revenues. But I don't think we're constrained by that. So what we're looking to do strategically, obviously, is to invest in the products that we acquire. So for instance, Acthar is a great example. Acthar is an older medicine. It had a lot of clinical experience, but it was actually rather short on more contemporary controlled trial data. So we're investing fairly heavily in Phase IV work across the major clinical conditions in which we promote: RA; lupus, for instance; and MS. We also -- where we see opportunities to progress development opportunities and expand our pipeline activities for both Acthar and other in-line brands as well as newer products, we're investing in those as well. So a good example with Acthar is the previous owners of the company and the product, Questcor, had initiated a study in ALS. It was a safety study. And we looked at that -- those safety results, and we also did some post-hoc analyses to get a better understanding of the potential value of the medicine to this particular condition. And remember, this is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition that leaves 70% or 80% of those afflicted dead within 5 years. So it's an area where really there is a tremendous amount of medical need. And we see what we believe is a signal of potential efficacy. Now we have to demonstrate that. So we're now moving forward and investing in a viable proof of concept trial that will allow us to definitively clarify whether there's value to Acthar in that particular population. So that's just an example. Now clearly, as we move forward, we want to build our organic pipeline. And you'll see greater investments, perhaps you'll see a shift in investments that include more pipeline products. For instance, the StrataGraft and ExpressGraft platforms that we recently acquired; the initiation of a trial for DMD, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, for Synacthen; and of course, the completion of our current registration trial in terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. So we're not constrained by that 7% or 8%. I'll certainly feel very happy going to both Mark and Matt and asking for more money, but we have to do it in a prioritized fashion, in a strategic fashion and they have to be valued investments."

But by generating the appropriate data and generating the right partnership and the right type of contractual agreements, we can hopefully mitigate some of that pressure and make sure patients can get access to the product at an affordable rate."

The majority of use for Acthar is usually in that kind of an episodic type role situation rather than a chronic. We do have some patients that are on it chronically, but that tends to be a relatively small proportion. Most patients are episodic, meaning they might have an episode in a given year. It might be another year or 2 before they have another episode. So again, this is not necessarily something where the expense to the patient is the same every year. In fact, it's predominantly in this episodic category."

Mark will start us off with some brief comments, then Matt will follow providing details on our financials. We'll then go to our customary Q&A session. 
Before we begin, let me remind you of some important details. On the call, you'll hear us making some forward-looking statements and it's possible that actual results could be materially different from our current expectations. Please note that we assume no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. We ask you to please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
We'll also provide some non-GAAP adjusted financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to GAAP is detailed in our earnings release and its related financial tables, which can be found in our website, mallinckrodt.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations pages of our website for such information. 
As noted in our press release, unless otherwise specified, all comparisons of quarterly or annual performance are to the fourth quarter or full year of fiscal 2015. In addition, the revenue growth ranges we'll be discussing today are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, the last quarter of 2016 included an extra selling week, a phenomenon that occurs once every 5 or 6 years with our 52, 53-week fiscal year accounting convention. While the exact quantification of the impact of the extra week is extremely difficult to determine, we believe it added approximately 6 to 9 percentage points to the quarterly sales growth rate of the company as a whole, and about 1 to 3 percentage points to our annual sales growth.
We're providing this estimated sales impact at the total Mallinckrodt level to give you context, but caution that you should not extrapolate it to any particular segment or product line as that may give you an inaccurate picture of our actual performance. 
For the September quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01, with full year fiscal 2016 GAAP earnings of $4.39. After adjusting for specified items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings for the quarter came in at $2.04 per share and $7.85 per share for the full year fiscal year 2016.

I'm pleased to report that Mallinckrodt delivered another strong volume-driven quarter to end fiscal year 2016, even before the positive impact of the extra selling week. As has been the case all year, our robust performance across Specialty Brands has more than offset expected declines in Specialty Generics, which continues to face significant challenges. Perhaps most importantly, we continued to fulfill our strategic vision in the quarter, with additional transformation of our portfolio. For example, we announced the planned divestiture of our Nuclear Imaging business, achieved wins in INOMAX intellectual property that we believe will further extend the durability of this asset; enhanced our growing organic pipeline, with acquisition of an innovative development platform of regenerative medicine skin substitutes that have the potential to transform the standard of treatment for burns and wound healing, advanced our trials for terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and Synacthen Depot in the treatment of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy and just last week we announced the new trial for Acthar in treatment of ALS.
These accomplishments marked the beginning of our transition into what we see as the next exciting chapter of our long-term strategic road map for sustainable success, driving in-line products, fostering innovation with investments in a growing organic pipeline and providing new patients with access to powerful effective treatment.
In our Brands business, strong focus on execution drove our achievements, and provides a great example of our Acquire to Invest strategy in action. We generate new clinical and health economic evidence, and then ensure the data is shared with health care providers and payers to help them understand the value our therapies bring to patients and the health care system.
Net sales were up 14% and 16% for the September quarter and the year, respectively, led by steady volume increases and strong performance across the Specialty Brands segment, which, as a whole, was up 36% for the quarter and 42% for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was notable as well, up 21% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This pattern of solid, predominantly volume-based growth in Specialty Brands has been consistent over the past several quarters and we see that trend continuing as we look ahead.
In Specialty Generics, which now represents less than 30% of our total net sales, the 19% decline in the quarter was consistent with our expectations. We've continued to project strong headwinds for this business for some time and expect significant downward pressure on the segment to persist. Having said that, the segment continues to generate cash. And we're focused on supplementing performance through careful cost management and select introduction of new ANDAs.
Regarding our methylphenidate ER product and the FDA's recent actions, we continue to disagree with the agency's position, based on scientific grounds, and we believe it's not consistent with the best interest of patients. We're moving forward with the hearing process, and we're pleased the agency granted our request for a 90-day extension, allowing us to submit more robust documentation. The evidence we're compiling demonstrates why we believe our therapy should remain available to ADHD patients who can benefit from this cost-effective alternative. As the process moves forward, we'll provide updates as appropriate, and we will continuously -- we will continue to vigorously defend the safety and effectiveness of our drug.
Now let me give you some additional perspective on the key products in our Specialty Brands business. Acthar contributed another strong quarter, with net sales up 19% in the period, driven predominantly by volume. Obviously, we're very pleased, but note that absent the extra week, these results would have been more in line with our expected mid-single to low double-digit range. We saw continued growth particularly in rheumatology, pulmonology and nephrology. This strong volume growth continues in this quarter, consistent with what we've seen since acquisition, propelled by our investments as well as commercial and medical affairs execution.
In rheumatology, we saw a steady prescription growth in both rheumatoid arthritis and in lupus, where we believe the published data on Acthar use continues to help physicians better understand the value it can provide to certain patients with these diseases. We're also seeing steady increases in pulmonology prescribing, as physicians absorb recently published data detailing Acthar's use in sarcoidosis. And we've redoubled our efforts in nephrology, helping us to continue to grow in that space.
Early feedback from our launch into ophthalmology is also promising, and we're dedicating resources to expand our efforts in this therapeutic area.
In infantile spasms, intensified efforts to ensure that infants afflicted with this condition have access to Acthar brought consistent market share gains across the past several quarters. We're committed to further broadening and improving our reach to this fragile patient population.
We continue to advance our Acthar market access strategy and engage with key payers. Acthar now has nearly 60% of commercial lives under contract, and we see potential for more. We're continuing to find ways to partner with payers to improve appropriate patient access. Overall contract performance has aligned with our expectations, informing our current efforts as we seek to further expand the percentage of covered lives under contract. As we expand patient access in pulmonology and rheumatology, our patient mix has shifted more toward older patients, many of whom are covered by Medicare. Based on our commercial and contracting momentum and data results, we remain confident in our long-term normalized growth rate expectations for this product in the mid-single to low double-digit range.
In the hospital business, INOMAX, our second largest product, delivered another stellar quarter with net sales up 22%, reflecting both demand growth, favorable contracting and the extra week. We believe the recommendations for earlier and prolonged use of nitric oxide in joint guidelines recently published by the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society are having a positive impact on use. Though unlikely to reach fiscal 2016 levels, we expect INOMAX will continue to see growth rates that are higher than historical norms for the next several quarters, with a return to more traditional mid-single-digit growth rates long term.
As I mentioned, in the quarter, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirmed the validity of multiple INOMAX drug and device patents, enhancing our confidence in the intellectual property estates surrounding INOMAX to at least 2031. But let me put INOMAX' performance into very human terms. This past year saw the highest annual consumption ever recorded for INOMAX. And in fiscal 2016, we estimate more than 10,000 critically ill neonates received INOMAX treatments. When you consider these instance and the children with infantile spasms who are treated with Acthar, it's no exaggeration to say that Mallinckrodt medicines are making a significant difference in the lives of families every day.
I'm pleased to report we achieved 23% growth in revenue for OFIRMEV in the quarter, results wholly driven by volume. Our strong performance is the result once again of commercial execution, bolstered by recently published health economic data showing the potential for multimodal analgesia to shortened hospital stays for certain patients. Going forward, we expect these factors to continue to drive OFIRMEV growth. 
We're encouraged by the continued performance of Therakos as we completed our first full year post-acquisition, with net sales growth of 24% on a pro forma basis. We're continuing to refine our commercial model for Therakos to present the best value proposition for customers and further expand patient access. We're separately working urgently to resolve temporary production issues we've recently experienced with our third-party manufacturer for kits supporting the older XTS product. Though the XTS device is being discontinued over time, it still makes up a meaningful portion of our installed base.
We expect to report negative revenue for the product in the December quarter. And while it's possible the situation could continue into the second quarter of 2017, we believe our efforts to mitigate this kit shortage will successfully resolve the issue sooner. Overall, revenue impact from the shortage is expected to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the December and March quarters. Importantly, we believe we will be able to offset most of the earnings impact in the December quarter from strength in the rest of our businesses.
Closing out Specialty Brands, our hemostasis portfolio has continued to perform in line with our expectations. We're pleased to be launching PreveLeak and Raplixa, and like most hospital launches, we expect a slow but steady uptake. The longer-term, double-digit growth we expect over this portfolio's 2016 net sales figure will be driven by the launches of these new products.
Now let me share the latest developments in science and technology. A core tenet of our Acquire to Invest strategy is not only to focus science and technology resources on supporting key in-line products, but to also build out a robust organic pipeline in Specialty Brands, developing new indications and new products in areas where patients currently have few alternatives and need better options.
Last week, we shared the exciting news that we will launch a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Acthar in nearly 200 patients with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition with extremely limited treatment options today. Built on observations in the initial pilot safety trial, we worked closely with the FDA on the design of the new program, and we're very pleased that our investigational new drug application, or INDA, was awarded the agency's fast track designation. The ALS study will assess the effects of Acthar on established measures of disease symptoms and progression, enabling us to evaluate the potential benefit it may bring to patients with this devastating disease. We expect the trial to begin enrolling in 2017, and it will take several years to complete.
Also for Acthar, we recently noted the first patients treated in company-sponsored trials for both rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. With these 3 and the recently announced FSGS study, Mallinckrodt's initiation of company-sponsored, randomized, controlled Acthar clinical trials will result in the study of the drug in more than 800 patients, a significant advancement for this product. Since acquisition, committed investments in HEOR medical affairs and research efforts for Acthar as well as the modernization of our manufacturing process equate to more than $0.25 billion. And we expect continued robust investment into the drug to continue in the years ahead.
More broadly, over the course of fiscal 2016, we initiated 5 company-sponsored trials for other Specialty Brands products. Our strong science focus is also evident in the nearly 100 publications and data presentations generated this year, almost half of which related to Acthar. In other areas of our pipeline, we continued to advance the Phase III terlipressin registration trial, and enrollment in the trial is progressing as planned. We received FDA fast track designation for our INDA for the study of Synacthen Depot in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and are pleased to report the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers is ongoing, and we'll provide the necessary data to inform dose selection for patients entering Phase II. 
In the quarter, as I mentioned, we also announced and closed our acquisition of a regenerative medicine company focused on proprietary human skin substitute products. The lead developmental product is StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue, which had received orphan designation from the FDA. And we're preparing to start both the Phase III trial for the treatment of severe, deep partial thickness burns, and the Phase II trial for treatment of severe, full thickness burns. If approved, this product could transform the standard of burn treatment, and the broader platform has potential to provide wound healing for other types of skin injury as well.
Now let me touch briefly on business development. We continue to be very focused on optimizing our commercial and development portfolio in 3 ways: building and diversifying our Specialty Brands platforms with additional commercialized assets consistent with our Acquire to Invest strategy; executing on transactions that will expand our pipeline; and opportunistically identifying and adding ANDAs to support our Specialty Generics portfolio, such as the recently announced Intellipharmaceutics license agreement. We're assessing a growing list of attractive opportunities, both commercial stage and development, and expect to further add to our portfolio in coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Let me take a few moments to go a little deeper into our financials. First, as a reminder, our Nuclear Imaging business has been reflected as a discontinued operation beginning in the September quarter, with each prior period recast to reflect this change. 
You've seen that the September quarterly results were strong, fueled largely by our higher-margin Specialty Brands segment coming in ahead of expectations. Net sales were $887 million, representing growth of 14%. September quarter net sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $633 million, representing growth of 36%, reflecting a specially strong performance from key brands and ongoing focus on driving volume. 
Acthar performed at the high end of our expectations in the quarter, with growth of 19% or $327 million in net sales, an all-time high even after adjusting for the additional selling week. We're also pleased to report that INOMAX generated $127 million in net sales, a 22% increase. As Mark noted, we believe many of the factors contributing to this growth will continue to be drivers in the near term.
Turning to OFIRMEV, we were pleased to see another increase in volume demand for the quarter, resulting in $76 million in net sales, a 23% increase. The Therakos business also performed well, with net sales of $55 million, a 24% increase on a pro forma basis.
Now let's turn to Specialty Generics, which continues to be challenged by overall market conditions and increased competition across a number of categories. We saw net sales of $240 million, representing a 19% decline over the prior year quarter, and an 18% decline for the fiscal year. We expect this downward trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
Turning to methylphenidate ER specifically, we are pursuing the FDA's hearing process, and we'll submit necessary documentation by the recently extended due date of March 19, 2017. However, remember this is a product with high gross margins above our corporate average, and if withdrawn, it would have a significant near-term impact to our earnings. Regardless of the outcome of the FDA process, we anticipate newly announced AB rated competitive entrants to further reduce our market share upon the launch of those products. 
As it relates to 2017 for our Specialty Generics business, we continue to expect double-digit declines in revenues, even taking into account the impact of the extra week comparison. Fortunately, and as we have seen this past year, we anticipate our Specialty Brands businesses will help to mitigate the declines we foresee for Specialty Generics.
Total company adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in the quarter to 75.3%. Due primarily to continued expected weakness in our Specialty Generics business, gross profit as a percentage of sales should be down sequentially over the next several quarters. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was nearly 8%, with absolute spend increased over prior year and a higher concentration of total spend was devoted to further investment in Specialty Brands. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the September quarter was 15.7% compared to 16.2%, affected primarily by business mix.
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We generated free cash flow of $141 million in the September quarter, bringing the total for the fiscal year to slightly over $1 billion. We have and will continue to focus on 3 capital allocation priorities: acquisitions, share repurchases and debt reduction. 
Notably, in fiscal 2016, we achieved the following: acquired the hemostasis portfolio in StrataGraft for a combined $245 million, repurchased a total of 651 million in shares and reduced debt by $470 million. Even with these actions, we ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $281 million and very manageable leverage, a net debt leverage ratio of a modest 3.6, as you can see posted on our website this morning. Note that the leverage ratio marginally increased from the prior quarter as it was unfavorably impacted by the move of Nuclear Imaging to discontinued operations, with no offsetting credit for the expected $574 million in upfront cash proceeds to be received when the transaction closes.
Looking ahead to 2017, you should expect to see continued strong cash generation, though the planned Nuclear divestiture and weakness in Specialty Generics will put downward pressure on our free cash flow as compared to 2016.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Cole who will take us into Q&A."

And as you mentioned, we now have our Nuclear business in the -- in discontinued operations. So while our long-term objective is to have no single product account for more than 1/3 of our operating income, currently our concentration has increased a bit. And certainly, Acthar now represents a significantly greater proportion of our operating income than 1/3. Our objective, again, long term, is to continue to diversify our portfolio. And so looking for opportunities that would enable us to do that relatively rapidly is obviously high on our objective. We will continue to update the marketplace going forward as we identify additional opportunities to expand our commercial portfolio as well as add to our development portfolio. So with regards to capital allocation, I think, certainly business development, all else being equal, is a high priority for us. But you've seen, with the amount of cash flow that we have, that we've been able to do a number of different things with our capital, including business development, buy back shares and reduce debt.

So with regards to M&A, we're very pleased with the assets that we've been able to accumulate over time, with focus on, again, as you said, Annabel, highly durable assets, typically those that are under-resourced, typically those that have relatively low patient penetration, where the opportunity for long-term growth is driven predominantly by volume, particularly if we make some very focused investments as we've done with virtually all of the companies and products that we've acquired over time. We like specifically the hospital marketplace. We like the autoimmune and rare disease space, because we believe these areas of the pharmaceutical industry typically are going to offer those types of assets, and we think that's the appropriate strategy to continue to focus on going forward. Both of those areas are, of course, quite broad, which enables us to look for assets across a number of different therapeutic areas and we think that focus is the right one going forward. With regards to generics, again, our long-term view is that this is a very solid cash generation business for us, one that's certainly helped diversify our portfolio as well as fund some of the additional M&A that we're doing. But we want to continue to enhance that business over time, both by operational efficiency as well as looking to build out a portfolio of ANDAs, which could provide growth and offset for the long term.

The other thing I would add is, you can see on the website today, we posted our net debt leverage ratio 3.6. If you actually take the math related to the Nuclear business and calculate that in, you'd find that our net debt leverage would be around 3.3. And so we are well positioned to continue to pursue business development. We've been able, as Mark said earlier, to not only buy back shares and do some acquisitions, but we've also paid down our debt in a significant way.

The fact that we have now nearly 60% of covered lives under some form of contract, given that 2 years ago, there were almost 0 lives under contract, is a really impressive performance. Let's just recognize though that signing contracts really doesn't guarantee you any business. What it does do is provide a vehicle so that you can promote broadly across your indication set, and gives you greater clarity longer term around market access in the commercial part of the business. It should be expected that the proportion of our businesses that is paid for by Medicare would increase given the fact that we are changing the mix of our business much more towards things like rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which typically affect older people. But overall, we're very pleased with the contracting approach. And Hugh, you may want to just add a couple of comments on how you see it going forward."

So I want to add a few points on this. I think it's important to keep in mind where we started. When we began with this product, we reengaged payers, we engaged payers for the first time, and that took some period of time. To Mark's point, we are pleased with what we've done, but we've put in place a strategy that allows us to capture the majority of our commercial lives under some form of contract with the first and foremost goal of trying to stabilize the reimbursement process and stabilize the marketplace. We're pleased with what we've seen there. As it relates to the shift in the payer mix, you guys know the story, which is really about the growth of where the business is coming from. And some of that growth is being driven by -- most of that growth is being driven by new patients. And those new patients are predominantly coming from areas of more elderly patients in areas of rheumatology, nephrology and pulmonology. And when that shift occurs, we would expect Medicare, specifically, to grow as an overall proportion of our payer mix versus what has been done historically when the majority of our business was in more acute indications like neurology and MS flares. So there's nothing here that's happening, I think, that we were surprised by. I think we are optimistic that our payer engagement strategy, starting with the clinical story and the rationale behind the appropriate use of the product, is taking hold by both dealing with our commercial payers as well as stabilizing the reimbursement landscape as our patients begin to evolve a little bit more towards the Medicare patient. So hopefully that helps."

So overall, our patient penetration rate is in the mid-single digits. It's continuing to grow, so we're very pleased about that. If we think about some of the newer indications like RA, lupus, pulmonary sarcoidosis, these are areas where, 2 years ago, where the patient penetration rates were less than 1%. And we're clearly seeing gains in penetration in those areas, predominantly on the basis of new data generation. I mean, you heard us talk about it in the prepared comments, just this year alone, we've literally put out dozens of data sets for Acthar, clinical data and health economic data, and it's that data that's been really driving a lot of the penetration in the business. With regards to the mix of payer, being in Medicare is just a natural result of the fact that the product mix is changing. You heard Hugh mention the fact that this business when we took it on a couple of years ago was predominantly a neurology business, and now it's starting to evolve much more into a pulmonology and rheumatology business."

When we look at -- it's always important to keep in context the patient populations that we're thinking about when we think about the use of Acthar and the appropriate use of Acthar. So this is usually a third or fourth line treatment. These are sicker patients who have failed on multiple therapeutic options. So when we think about appropriate patient penetration, we're talking about relatively small numbers of patients that are appropriate for the use of the product. And even at that, there are still significant opportunity for us to be able to penetrate those markets greater than where we've been, to Mark's point earlier. Now when we think about Medicare, I want to make a comment about that. I think it's -- we don't view one payer channel easier than any other payer channel. I think the entire way we're thinking about this business is by generating the appropriate health economic outcome, research data, the appropriate clinical data, that the compelling story for Acthar will be such that those appropriate patients will be agreed upon between the payer and us and the clinician in how we actually promote the product. So we don't expect and we don't take for granted the Medicare channel. We actually work very hard in order to continue to position the product appropriately clinically as well as from an HEOR perspective and the value associated with that. And as the mix continues to shift, as we launch more data and more indications, our expectation, this is a moving target. Payer mix does not stay static. It is dynamic. And as the portfolio shifts a little bit, we expect that, that will change over time as well."

I'd go back to the initial discussion we just had about how we see the evolution of the business. We are always constantly trying to ensure that the evidence that we have for the appropriate use of the product holds true regardless of who the payer is. Now I think the Medicare component is one where, as you guys know, there are third-party insurers that interact to Part D that negotiates specifically with manufacturers. We continue to have those engagements about the appropriate clinical rationale for the product and about the value equation for the product. We do like to see, obviously, continued evidence generation and growth for the brand, whether it's commercial payers or Medicare payers. There is always risk inherent in the action that payers could potentially take a bit against the product, whether it's Medicare or Medicaid or the commercial channel. But what's really important for us and what we feel optimistic about, and you've heard Mark mention it earlier in the work and the partnership we're doing with our science colleagues, is the more data we can generate, the more evidence we can generate, the more appropriate use of the product that we agree with, with the payers and how to position it appropriately, the more we can mitigate that risk.

And we do see that growth rate likely to continue, albeit not necessarily at the rates that we've seen in 2016, but certainly higher than the mid-single-digit range that has been the historical situation driven by a couple of factors. One is certainly our contracting approach to the marketplace has been quite positive. But also, the fact that consumption has increased consumption, meaning utilization has increased. And we think part of that is just the fact that the guidelines that support prolonged and earlier use of nitric oxide for the benefit of patients, the combined factors of those guidelines, plus our contracting strategy, we think, is really driving this increased utilization, this increased volume utilization. And we would expect to see that continue over time, albeit as we've said, longer term, we would expect this business to revert back to more of a single digit -- mid-single digit type growth business, but we think there'll be a tail in between what we've generated in 2016 and that kind of longer-term normalized growth rate."

And we're more than happy to reinvest in R&D to realize the future of the company. As it relates to free cash flow, a couple of things you need to be thinking about there. The first is, the fourth quarter, you'll see this in the 10-K when we file it, some people may think that the cash flow was a little bit low in the fourth quarter, but in the 10-K, you'll see that we paid cash taxes of $165 million in the quarter that impacted the number that we posted. I was very happy though on balance for the full year, because a year ago, when we said that we thought we'd generate about $1 billion in free cash flow, coming in at $1.2 billion is pretty remarkable. No one could have pegged it that closely against that target, but obviously we've been able to put that back to use on multiple different ways. As it relates to capacity, we certainly have a lot of room. As I mentioned earlier, we are still in a very good position as it relates to our net debt leverage, Sumant. I encourage you to look at our website and see the calculation of the 3.6, with slight uptick from the third quarter, but really it's driven by the Nuclear business going out. So we have plenty of capacity. The highest we've taken our net debt leverage was in the low 5s. But we still are generating a lot of cash, we still have roughly $600 million coming in from the Nuclear divestiture in the first half of the year. So I would say, we really don't feel constrained as it relates to doing business development. The big key is really finding something that fits all of our criteria."

So first around just the targeting of our spend, it's roughly about 7% of our revenue -- projected revenues. But I don't think we're constrained by that. So what we're looking to do strategically, obviously, is to invest in the products that we acquire. So for instance, Acthar is a great example. Acthar is an older medicine. It had a lot of clinical experience, but it was actually rather short on more contemporary controlled trial data. So we're investing fairly heavily in Phase IV work across the major clinical conditions in which we promote: RA; lupus, for instance; and MS. We also -- where we see opportunities to progress development opportunities and expand our pipeline activities for both Acthar and other in-line brands as well as newer products, we're investing in those as well. So a good example with Acthar is the previous owners of the company and the product, Questcor, had initiated a study in ALS. It was a safety study. And we looked at that -- those safety results, and we also did some post-hoc analyses to get a better understanding of the potential value of the medicine to this particular condition. And remember, this is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition that leaves 70% or 80% of those afflicted dead within 5 years. So it's an area where really there is a tremendous amount of medical need. And we see what we believe is a signal of potential efficacy. Now we have to demonstrate that. So we're now moving forward and investing in a viable proof of concept trial that will allow us to definitively clarify whether there's value to Acthar in that particular population. So that's just an example. Now clearly, as we move forward, we want to build our organic pipeline. And you'll see greater investments, perhaps you'll see a shift in investments that include more pipeline products. For instance, the StrataGraft and ExpressGraft platforms that we recently acquired; the initiation of a trial for DMD, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, for Synacthen; and of course, the completion of our current registration trial in terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. So we're not constrained by that 7% or 8%. I'll certainly feel very happy going to both Mark and Matt and asking for more money, but we have to do it in a prioritized fashion, in a strategic fashion and they have to be valued investments."

We work very diligently with not only Medicare, but across all the payer mix, in order to ensure that patients can have access to the product and it's affordable appropriately for those patients. That pressure will continue, I think, regardless of whether it's Acthar across all Specialty Brands, as payers begin to look at how to best manage those large-scale spends.
