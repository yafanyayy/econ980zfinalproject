Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today. We've completed the first quarter as HP Inc. And while we continue to face macroeconomic and market headwinds, we are executing to the plan laid out at our security analyst meeting last September. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through our planned quarterly dividend and aggressive share buybacks, taking advantage of the stock price.
And while revenue continued to be challenged by market traction in PCs printing, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in APGA and in strategic growth segments of the portfolio including commercial mobility, retail solutions, graphics and services. Cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, driven by changes in working capital, which was impacted by lower Personal Systems volume. We've taken immediate actions to stay on track to deliver our full year commitment. Cathie will walk you through those details in just a few minutes. 
As you consider our financial performance for the quarter, remember that the operate in mature markets. This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and how to execute our competitors.
A key driver of success in competitive markets is product innovation and differentiation. Innovation is the lifeblood of HP. This year at CES, we had an outstanding show of new products and took home more than a dozen awards for products like The Portfolio, the world's thinnest and largest business-class notebook. Demonstrating the consumerization of IT, we took best of show for a business class products because it has the rugged features needed for mobile workers, but the sleek and stylish design that, let's face it, we all want. As the global commercial PC leader, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category's capable of, and it's exciting to see the market's reaction to our progress.
Earlier this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced the HP Elite x3, a revolutionary category-creating mobile solution that brings together mobility and computing in a truly meaningful way. Some in the industry are calling it a new standard for commercial mobility. Run in the Windows 10 mobile platform, the HP x3 unites tablet, laptop and desktop experiences into a single device.  Along with its accessories, it's really the one device that every device, enabling users to scale from simple texting to spreadsheets and PowerPoint utilizing corporate applications. With our strong channel partners and the latest advancements for Microsoft, Qualcomm and Salesforce, we are turning the promise of mobile productivity into reality for our business customers.
In printing, we launched the Pagewide Excel product in our graphics portfolio for our initial entry in the technical production market. These fast, large format mono and color printers are expected to disrupt a $1 billion market and achieve a leading share position.
Targeting the SMB segment in emerging markets, we launched the DeskJet GD, a continuous interplay system printer to meet the needs of these high-usage customers. In the coming months, you can expect to see a refresh in inkjet products and the completion of the jet intelligence laser portfolio refresh. We are also planning to make other strategic announcement around 3D printing.
Our product portfolio across the board is our best ever, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as the markets steadily improve.
Before I go into business performance, let me remind you of our objectives going in the quarter. First, in addition to continuing to solution the productivity initiatives shared at last September on our Q4 earnings call, we said we would materially change our nonrevenue-generating costs structure to allow us to compete more effectively in these competitive markets. Not only are the $1 billion of productivity initiatives on track, but we are accelerating the restructuring program also announced at SAM by increasing the fiscal '16 employee reductions to approximately 3,000. I believe there may be even more opportunity to reduce costs and streamline processes, and we will share details when finalized.
Second, we said we would balance our pricing actions with marketing and sales activity to both stimulate demand, to drive prospects stability the market. outcome for printing hardware was a sequential increase in ASPs overall. And while this approach also contributed significantly to the unit decline, working assumption is that this will ultimately result in an improved competitive environment.
And in Personal Systems, we said we will continue to shift our mix to the high end and walk away from negative margin business. During the quarter, the team executed this strategy very well, offsetting headwinds and maintaining ASPs and flat gross margin year-over-year. 
Lastly, we said we will invest in strategic growth initiatives beyond core. And we've made solid progress in areas such as commercial mobility and graphics, and our plans are on track for 3D and A3.
Now turning to the segments. We saw mixed results across the portfolio. Starting with Personal Systems, I am pleased with our performance as we the market profitably and maintained our #1 position in commercial, with an all-time-high share of 24% in calendar fourth quarter of 2015.  We held our strong leadership position in workstations with almost 42% share. And we gained the #1 spot in mobile workstations. The overall PC market was slower to recover than expected, but we continued to execute, manage our channel inventory and improve product mix.
We both defended our existing business and won new opportunities from incumbents. For example, we closed a large U.K. public sector contract, retaining desktop product business and bidding all the key competitors. And we won back significant business with one of the world's largest multinational banking and financial service firms with our commercial Elite book. 
Just as importantly, we made progress on our key growth initiatives beyond the core. Commercial mobility, which includes tablets and detachables, grew strong double digits year-over-year. And we are seeing continued momentum with the recent launch of the Elite detachable.
Turning to printing. In quarter 1, many of the challenges we discussed in the Q4 earnings call continued as expected. Let me remind you of the competitive advantage the Japanese printing vendors have associated with the weakness of the yen, which allowed them to price more aggressively. Further market contraction compounded the situation. We also experienced weakness in emerging markets and tough economic conditions in key countries. As we said in Q4, we consider this to be the new normal, and we are executing to our plan. 
Let me first discuss the core business results, starting with hardware units which were down 20% year-over-year.  Approximately 7 points of the decline was a result of our pricing actions that drove higher average selling prices in constant currency. About 4 points were due to the reduction of partner channel inventory. We effectively managed the channel with less promotional dollars. And as a result, our sellout share trends were better than our sell-in share transport. Worldwide inventory levels are healthy going into quarter 2. About 3 points was associated with marginal units that we chose not to place as we worked more costs out of the system. And the remainder can be attributed to overall market contraction.
Shifting to supplies. The year-over-year revenue was down 8% in constant currency. The factors driving the decline that we're expected going into the quarter were installed base erosion from declining hardware sales and channel inventory adjustments. The factors that varied from our plan where pricing and aftermarket share. Supplies pricing was up given adjustments we made to offset some of the unfavorable currency, but not as much as planned given necessary discounting in the quarter to combat aftermarket alternatives. Our aftermarket share was more pressured than expected for toner.
So what are we doing about it? We know the levers required to drive stability in a profitable supply revenue stream. We need to build the hardware installed base with the shift to high-value units. Cost actions are in progress and on track so that we can place more of the marginal units profitably going forward. We need to win back aftermarket share. And we are already executing actions to support an aggressive share improvement plan, including online programs and increased sales coverage to promote the value of original supplies. And we continue to strategically monitor supplies pricing so the currency adjustments don't result in increased aftermarket alternatives pressure. Despite the market headwinds, with our mitigation plans, we remain confident in our outlook for supplies revenues in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017.
In addition to optimizing the corporate business, we plan to continue to drive progress in our strategic areas including graphics and managed print services, both of which grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency. As we said at SAM, we have tough quarters ahead. And while we are making progress, we have more work to do. I remain confident in the future. We have a strong product lineup, a powerful innovation road map and a proven ability to take costs out of the business.
Now I'll turn it over to Cathie to go through more details and provide our financial outlook."

Before I begin, I want to comment on a few financial reporting items. The SEC filings and investor deck reflect historical financials for discontinued operations basis of accounting, which is also what I'll speak to today. In this accounting presentation, there are some historical expenses that are allocated to the parent company, which was HP Inc. in the U.S. Some examples include corporate governance costs and SG&A, foreign exchange gains and losses and expense and all related to HP Co. Because of these accounting rules, historical expenses reported in continuing operations are higher than as compared to a pro forma operational view.  Net revenue, gross margin and R&D expense are more comparable year-over-year.
Turning to the P&L results. Q1 performance was largely as expected, and overall, we are making progress against the strategy we laid out at SAM. At the company level, we reported net revenue of $12.2 billion, down 12% year-over-year or 5% at constant currency. While EMEA and Americas regions continued to decline, we saw constant currency revenue growth in APJ, driven by strength in Personal Systems. We had a favorable impact to onetime release of deferred revenue related to legacy HP Financial Services business, now that our engagement is no longer intracompany. This was accounted for in corporate eliminations.
Gross margin of 18.7% was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in print, partially offset by benign commodity cost and favorable mix in Personal Systems. Gross margin was down 0.6 points sequentially due to weak currencies and print mix combined with continued competitive pricing. 
Operating profit of 7.5% was down 0.4 points year-over-year driven by print gross margins and loss of operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 14% year-over-year, primarily due to corporate governance costs related to HP Co. and currency. With a net expense of $94 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range.
This result excludes charges of $20 million for restructuring and $8 million for amortization of intangible assets, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million.  On a GAAP basis, Q1 diluted net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.36.
Turning to the segments. In Personal Systems, we continued to execute well against the tough market backdrop. In Q1, we delivered net revenue of $7.5 billion, down 13% year-over-year as reported or 6% in constant currency. In calendar fourth quarter, the overall PC market experienced steep declines, with units down 11% year-over-year according to IDC. The market contraction created a very competitive pricing environment and a battle for share gains. HP gained PC unit share across all 3 regions, exceeding 20% share worldwide for the first time ever. As Dion said, we were very focused on higher-margin PC opportunities in strategic premium categories, including 2-in-1 mobile workstations, clients, retail solutions and gaming.
Our consumer premium category, where we are #1 among all Windows OEMs, continued to grow and gained over 4 points of share year-over-year. And our consumer gaming business is on track to double revenue by year-end. 
Amidst this competitive pricing environment, the team executed well by holding ASPs flat sequentially. Year-over-year, currency headwinds were offset by favorable mix, pricing and the increased attach of higher configuration options, displays and services.
Operating profit was 3.1%, down 0.4 points year-over-year due to loss of operating expense leverage and currency weakness, partially offset by favorable commodity costs, pricing and mix.
Now on to print. Printing remained challenged in the quarter with net revenue of $4.6 billion, down 17% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency with declines in all regions. Emerging markets are particularly weak due to currency devaluation and overall economic slowdown. Operating profit was 17%, down 1.8 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable currency and pricing environment, combined with loss of operating expense leverage partially offset by favorable mix.
Beyond the currency headwinds of 6 points, both hardware sales and supplies performance contributed to the overall revenue decline. Starting with hardware, consumer and commercial units were down 23% and 15% year-over-year respectively. 
Overall, we were strategically focused on shaping the installed base with high-usage units while also maintaining pricing discipline. As a result, we saw sequential improvement in constant currency ASPs in the ink jet and laser hardware portfolio, but units were down. When that was combined with channel inventory corrections, we lost 3 points of total share year-over-year in calendar fourth quarter. We gained 1 point of share in value multifunction laser printers and achieved share gains in design and large-format industrial printers.  Ink in the Office hardware units were down year-over-year primarily due to managing sell-in volumes ahead of our product refresh in the spring.
Turning to supplies. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or 8% in constant currency and comprised 57% of the total print revenue. channel inventory was slightly above the range, but we reduced the inventory dollar value both year-over-year and sequentially. Although the business remained challenge, we made solid progress on our core and growth initiatives. 
In managed services, our new business total contract value was up double digits year-over-year as reported, and our renewal rates remain strong. In Q1, we secured a significant new logo win with John Hopkins to produce over 20 million pages monthly. We saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, increasing enrollees over 30% sequentially. And graphics revenue grew once again year-over-year in constant currency. Contributing to this performance was a win with Quantum Group, a print service provider who replaced its digital printing portfolio with a fleet of HP Indigo digital presses in order to accelerate turnaround time, increase quality and productivity and provide customers with enhanced application options.
Now on an update for restructuring.  In Q1, about 400 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in September. As Dion mentioned, we are accelerating the program and now expect approximately 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal '16 instead of over 3 years.  In addition, we are driving significant nonlabor savings from nonrevenue-generating operations in the second half of the year. The acceleration of the employee exits and some of the incremental nonlabor savings will drive GAAP-only charges and associated cash payments of approximately $300 million in the current year. The labor actions will provide gross annual savings of approximately the same amount on a run-rate basis beginning in fiscal 2017.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow was disappointing, with cash used in operations of $108 million and free cash flow use of $228 million. Note that these results include separation cash payments of $78 million. We expected to generate free cash flow of about $300 million in Q1. The primary reason for the missed expectation was due to the actual revenue coming in lower particularly in Personal Systems, driving accounts payable and volume-sensitive accrued liabilities lower at quarter end.  
The cash conversion cycle increased 4 days sequentially to negative 15 days. This was primarily driven by a decrease of 11 days of payables driven by unfavorable linearity, volume and supplier mix in Personal Systems. The pressure on the cash conversion cycle from DPO was partially offset by improvements in DSO and DOI.
The cash flow headwind in Q1 is mostly a timing issue due to the negative cash conversion cycle of this business. The only permanent impact to cash flow is from cash earnings on the reduced revenue. But because Personal Systems is slower to recover than originally assumed, we have implemented very targeted actions in an effort to positively impact each of the working capital metrics in order to offset the Q1 results and preserve the normalized free cash flow commitment for the full year. For example, we see opportunities to reduce inventory through better demand-supply matching, to increase DPO by extensions of payable terms and better purchasing linearity within each quarter. 
Given the acceleration of our restructuring activities, our fiscal '16 free cash flow outlook will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, a reduction of $100 million from our prior outlook. updated outlook now assumes approximately $300 million for separation and $300 million for restructuring activity payments. We expect to retain our normalized annual free cash flow in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion.
We repurchased 67 million shares in the quarter and paid $221 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of just over $1 billion. For the full year, we are on track to return 75% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Looking forward, there are a few assumptions we've made in our financial outlook for Q2 specifically. In printing, we will continue to be strategic in placing hardware units, with a focus on those that yield high supply usage over time. And we'll continue our pricing discipline. We expect this to yield a double-digit decline in hardware units year-over-year. 
Our reported supplies revenue is expected to decline double digits year-over-year, which is incorporated in our outlook o f the stabilization in constant currency by the end of 2017.
In graphics, we expect some softness in demand ahead of Drupa, the largest graphics printing trade show, consistent with the trends we have experienced in the past years leading up to this event, which occurs just once every 4 years.
For fiscal 2016. In Personal Systems and printing, we expect our year-over-year revenue decline to moderate throughout the year, with improving market dynamics and lower channel inventory reductions. And our productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring activities supports significant improvement in profitability in the second half.
With all that in mind, I will provide our earnings outlook for continuing operations. Our Q2 '16 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Our Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38. And we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share is in the range of $1.52 to $1.62.
With that, let's open it up to questions."

We outlined that at the security analyst meeting. We expect that for several quarters ahead. We broadly agree with IDC's predictions of the market sort of mid-single-digit declines. However, we see in the back half of this year that revenue will begin to improve as the technology improves and as channel inventory works its way out of the system. It's a continuous evolution. As market leaders, we're looking to evolve and create new categories. Look at the work we did this week in Mobile World Congress with the Elite. That's a terrific example of category creation. That's a new mobile solution. But it's not a PC, it's not a fablet, it's not a notebook. It's all 3. So the PC lines are kind of being redrawn at the moment. And our goal, as it has been consistently for the past 3 years, is to gain profitable share. We choose to play in certain areas. We choose not to play in other areas. So we have a fairly consistent formula here. We segment the market. We figure out where to play, where not to play. We continue to take costs out of the system. We continue to drive innovation into the system. And we're not after share for share's sake. I would say that Windows 10, whilst I still believe is a tremendous operating system platform, and universal apps and continue computing that devices like the Elite x3 a reality, we have not yet seen the anticipated Windows 10 stimulation of demand that we would have hoped for. And we're carefully monitoring any sort of price developments that could further weaken demand. So we're operating in still a large market. The big guys are getting bigger, and we think there is opportunity in that landscape."

And looking at the installed base from a perspective of total size, to Dion's point, increasing the installed base by taking more costs out so that we can place units that are marginal today, that can be profitable in the future, is important. But it's also important to look at what the mix is within that installed base, which is the second box, which is around usage. And that's really focusing on placing higher-usage units. Then you're also going to look at what your position is from a market share perspective. And we talked about -- I think Dion talked in his prepared remarks about the fact that we had a multipronged approach to drive increasing market share. Aftermarket share -- sorry, aftermarket supplies share with online, more feet on the street, but also driving Instant Ink adoption in our develop markets. We have in fact expanded our market to not include Spain and Canada, to continue to drive managed print services where we get a very high HP supplies attached. And we saw double digit as reported and constant currency growth in new PCB for managed print services, and then finally, kind of completing the rollout of jet intelligence in the laser market. When we come out with new platform, that HP attach is extremely high. And we came out of this new platform called jet intelligence, and we're completing the rollout this year."

You might think that lower discount liability is a good thing, but if it's really falling in line with -- in proportion to revenue, it creates a challenge at the end of the quarter.

Dion, I wanted to just clarify and push a little bit on supplies. So when you guys talked about supply stabilizing at the end of 2017, that means that they'll stop declining, so 0% growth or better. I just want to be sure I understand that. But more important, if I look at your hardware, printer hardware revenues, they've declined for 18 out of the last 19 quarters. That's probably the best proxy for the first 2 boxes in your 4-box model, which is the installed base and the quality of the installed base, which is the function of revenue. If I think about the third part of 4-box model, which is aftermarket share, you conceded that aftermarket share actually declined this quarter. And my belief is for over the last 5 years, it's also gone down. So if I think about in the fourth part of your 4-box model around the new platform, quite frankly given that it only applies to laser and that's less than half of your profits in IPG, I don't think it's big enough to move it. So I guess the question is what am I missing? I know the 4-box model sort of sounds very logical, and it is very logical. But when I systematically step through the thesis and see we've had 19 -- 18 out of 19 quarters of down hardware, aftermarket's going in the wrong direction, what am I missing that dries stabilization 6 quarters ?"

So the 4-box model is predictive tool, and we use it extensively. It has a lot of complexity built into it. Not all units are created equally. We have -- we can place a particular unit in one demographic, place exactly the same unit in a different demographic. And it can yield an entirely different usage pattern, and we can have a different prices associated with it. So when you think all the combinations associated with that 4-box model, it is something that we focus on very carefully that shapes the way we place units. It informs how we price, and it even informs how we market. As we stated in the last quarter's earnings, we expected the units to be down and that we're down this quarter. Some of that was quite intentional, as we've already outlined. But characterizing what I would refer to is the normal in the market environment where we think the currencies are going to continue to put downward pressure on pricing, what we structurally need to do is to take costs out of the system so that they we put marginal units back into the pan. So we are really focused on pricing good units into the plan does work. those are positive, taking costs out of our operations, particularly in the areas of nonrevenue-generating activities. And that will benefit more in the second half than in the first half. And that will enable us to put units back so it addresses the first box. Managing these inventory levels was a key start to getting that done, and we did that in quarter 1. Then we said we have to turn to stimulating demand and driving price discipline into the market, and we did that. So some of the proof points I think as you look to evaluate the model is what's actually happening as a result of that. business is continuing to grow in constant currency. Instant Ink grew 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that is of course, our subscription-based service. That's really important to address the declining home segment market. And the adoption rates are there and the retention rates are incredibly high. Our graphics business is growing. Our ASPs improved quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. And areas of multifunction printers and high-value units also grew. With regards to aftermarket share, which is one of the other boxes that you referred to, competitors are pretty keen to understand that we're going to do here as well. So I'll remain at a relatively high level as I talk about this. The actions that we're taking vary geography by geography. They're very targeted. They're very segmented, as you would expect us to do. It's informed by the data wherever possible. We're increasing our supplies of sales specialists in all the regions and changing the marketing mix in where we spend marketing dollars to drive aftermarket supplies the value of our and HP original supplies. And we're reshaping the MBO of the leadership team as well as the commission structures for our organization. And so there's a very comprehensive things afoot that gives us confidence that our supplies will return or stabilize in constant currency by the end of 2017."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today. We've completed the first quarter as HP Inc.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today. We've completed the first quarter as HP Inc. And while we continued to face macroeconomic and market headwinds, we are executing to the plan we laid out at our Security Analysts Meeting last September. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through our planned quarterly dividend and aggressive share buybacks, taking advantage of the stock price.
And while revenue continued to be challenged by market traction in PCs and core printing, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in APJ and in strategic growth segments of the portfolio, including commercial mobility, retail solutions, graphics and services. Cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, driven by changes in working capital, which was impacted by lower personal systems volume. We've taken immediate actions to stay on track to deliver our full year commitment. Cathie will walk you through those details in just a few minutes. 
As you consider our financial performance for the quarter, remember that we operate in mature markets. This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and how to execute our competitors.
A key driver of success in competitive markets is product innovation and differentiation. Innovation is the lifeblood of HP. This year at CES, we had an outstanding show of new products and took home more than a dozen awards for products like the EliteBook Folio, the world's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook. Demonstrating the consumerization of IT, we took best of show for a business-class product because it has the rugged features needed for mobile workers, but the sleek and stylish design that, ""Let's face it, we all want."" As the global commercial PC leader, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, and it's exciting to see the market's reaction to our progress.
Earlier this week, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced the HP Elite x3, a revolutionary category-creating mobile solution that brings together mobility and computing in a truly meaningful way. Some in the industry are calling it a new standard for commercial mobility. Running the Windows 10 mobile platform, the HP Elite x3 unites phablet, laptop and desktop experiences into a single device.  Along with its accessories, it's truly the one device that's every device, enabling users to scale from simple texting to spreadsheets and PowerPoint utilizing corporate applications. With our strong channel partners and the latest advancements from Microsoft, Qualcomm and Salesforce, we are turning the promise of mobile productivity into reality for our business customers.
In printing, we launched the PageWide Excel product in our graphics portfolio for our initial entry in the technical production market. These fast, large-format mono and color printers are expected to disrupt a $1 billion market and achieve a leading share position.
Targeting the SMB segment in emerging markets, we launched the DeskJet GT, a continuous ink-supply system printer, to meet the needs of these high-usage customers. 
In the coming months, you can expect to see a refresh of inkjet products and the completion of the jet intelligence laser portfolio, Refresh. We are also planning to make other strategic announcements around 3D printing.
Our product portfolio across the board is our best ever, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as the markets steadily improve.
Before I go into business performance, let me remind you of our objectives going in the quarter. First, in addition to continuing to solution the productivity initiatives shared at last September on our Q4 earnings call, we said we would materially change our nonrevenue-generating cost structure to allow us to compete more effectively in these competitive markets. Not only are the $1 billion of productivity initiatives on track, but we are accelerating the restructuring program, also announced at SAM, by increasing the fiscal '16 employee reductions to approximately 3,000. I believe there may be even more opportunity to reduce cost and streamline processes, and we will share details when finalized.
Second, we said we would balance our pricing actions with marketing and sales activity to both stimulate demand, to drive prospects stability the market. The outcome for printing hardware was a sequential increase in ASPs overall. And while this approach also contributed significantly to the unit declined, our working assumption is that this will ultimately result in an improved competitive environment.
And in Personal Systems, we said we will continue to shift our mix to the high end and walk away from negative margin business. During the quarter, the team executed this strategy very well, offsetting headwinds and maintaining ASPs and flat gross margin year-over-year. 
Lastly, we said we would invest in strategic growth initiatives beyond the core, and we've made solid progress in areas such as commercial mobility and graphics. And our plans are on track for 3D and A3.
Now turning to the segments. We saw mixed results across the portfolio. Starting with Personal Systems, I am pleased with our performance as we the market profitably and maintained our #1 position in commercial, with an all-time high share of 24% in calendar fourth quarter of 2015.  
We held our strong leadership position in workstation with almost 42% share and regain the #1 spot in mobile workstations. The overall PC market was slower to recover than expected, but we continued to execute, manage our channel inventory and improve product mix.
We both defended our existing business and won new opportunities from incumbents. For example, we closed a large U.K. public sector contract, retaining desktop product business and bidding all the key competitors. And we won back significant business with one of the world's largest multinational banking and financial service firms with our commercial EliteBook. 
Just as importantly, we made progress on our key growth initiatives beyond the core. Commercial mobility, which includes tablets and detachables, grew strong double digits year-over-year, and we are seeing continued momentum with the recent launch of the Elite x2 detachable.
Turning to printing. In quarter 1, many of the challenges we discussed on the Q4 earnings call continued as expected. Let me remind you of the competitive advantage the Japanese printing vendors have associated with the weakness of the yen, which allowed them to price more aggressively. Further market contraction compounded this situation. We also experienced weakness in emerging markets and tough economic conditions in key countries. As we said in Q4, we consider this to be the new normal, and we are executing to our plan. 
Let me first discuss the core business results, starting with hardware units: which were down 20% year-over-year.  Approximately 7 points of the decline were the result of our pricing actions that drove higher average selling prices in constant currency. About 4 points were due to the reduction of hardward channel inventory. We effectively managed the channel with less promotional dollars, and as a result, our sellout share trends were better than our sell-in share trends. Worldwide inventory levels are healthy going into quarter 2.  About 3 point  was associated with marginal units that we chose not to place as we worked more costs out of the system. And the remainder can be attributed to overall market contraction.
Shifting to supplies. The year-over-year revenue was down 8% in constant currency. The factors driving the decline that were expected going into the quarter were installed-base erosion from declining hardware sales and channel inventory adjustments. The factors that varied from our plan where pricing and aftermarket share. Supplies pricing was up, given adjustments we made to offset some of the unfavorable currency, but not as much as planned given necessary discounting in the quarter to combat aftermarket alternatives. Our aftermarket share was more pressured than expected for toner.
So what are we doing about it? We know the levers required to drive stability in a profitable supply revenue stream. We need to build the hardware installed base with the shift to high-value units. Cost actions are in progress and on track so that we can place more of the marginal units profitably going forward. We need to win back aftermarket share, and we are already executing actions to support an aggressive share improvement plan, including online programs, and increased sales coverage to promote the value of original supplies. And we continue to strategically monitor supplies pricing so the currency adjustments don't result in increased aftermarket alternatives pressure. Despite the market headwinds, with our mitigation plans, we remain confident in our outlook for supplies revenues in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017.
In addition to optimizing the core print business, we plan to continue to drive progress in our strategic areas, including graphics and managed print services, both of which grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency. As we said at SAM, we have tough quarters ahead, and while we are making progress, we have more work to do. I remain confident in the future. We have a strong product lineup, a powerful innovation road map and a proven ability to take costs out of the business.
Now I'll turn it over to Cathie to go through more details and provide our financial outlook."

Before I begin, I want to comment on a few financial reporting items. The SEC filings and investor deck reflect historical financials for discontinued operations basis of accounting, which is also what I'll speak to today. In this accounting presentation, there are some historical expenses that are allocated fully to the parent company, which was HP Inc. in the U.S. Some examples include: corporate governance costs and SG&A, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest expense, and OI&E, all related to HP Co. Because of these accounting rules, historical expenses reported in continuing operations are higher as compared to a pro forma operational view.  Net revenue, gross margin and R&D expense are more comparable year-over-year.
Turning to the P&L results. Q1 performance was largely as expected. And overall, we are making progress against the strategy we laid out at SAM. At the company level, we reported net revenue of $12.2 billion, down 12% year-over-year or 5% at constant currency. While the EMEA and Americas regions continued to decline, we saw constant currency revenue growth in APJ, driven by strength in Personal Systems. We had a favorable impact to onetime release of deferred revenue related to legacy HP Financial Services business, now that our engagement is no longer intracompany. This was accounted for in corporate elimination.
Gross margin of 18.7% was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in print, partially offset by benign commodity costs and favorable mix in Personal Systems. Gross margin was down 0.6 points sequentially due to weak currencies and print mix, combined with continued competitive pricing. 
Operating profit of 7.5% was down 0.4 points year-over-year, driven by print gross margins and loss of operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 14% year-over-year, primarily due to corporate governance costs related to HP Co. and currency. With a net expense of $94 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.36 in the middle of our outlook range.
This result excluded charges of $20 million for restructuring and $8 million for amortization of intangible assets, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million.  
On a GAAP basis, Q1 diluted net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.36.
Turning to the segments. In Personal Systems, we continued to execute well against the tough market backdrop. In Q1, we delivered net revenue of $7.5 billion, down 13% year-over-year, as reported, or 6% in constant currency. 
In calendar fourth quarter, the overall PC market experienced steep declines, with units down 11% year-over-year according to IDC. The market contraction created a very competitive pricing environment and a battle for share gains. HP gained PC units share across all 3 regions, exceeding 20% share worldwide for the first time ever. As Dion said, we were very focused on higher-margin PC opportunities in strategic premium categories, including 2-in-1s, mobile workstations, thin clients, retail solutions and gaming.
Our consumer premium category, where we are #1 among all Windows OEMs, continued to grow and gained over 4 points of share year-over-year. And our consumer gaming business is on track to double revenue by year-end. 
Amidst this competitive pricing environment, the team executed well by holding ASPs flat sequentially. Year-over-year, currency headwinds were offset by favorable mix, pricing and the increased attach of higher-configuration options, displays and services.
Operating profit was 3.1%, down 0.4 points year-over-year due to loss of operating expense leverage and currency weakness, partially offset by favorable commodity costs, pricing and mix.
Now on to print. Printing remained challenged in the quarter with net revenue of $4.6 billion, down 17% year-over-year, as reported, or 11% in constant currency, with declines in all regions. Emerging markets were particularly weak due to currency devaluation and overall economic slowdown. 
Operating profit was 17%, down 1.8 points year-over-year, due to the unfavorable currency and pricing environment, combined with loss of operating expense leverage partially offset by favorable mix.
Beyond the currency headwinds of 6 points, both hardware sales and supplies performance contributed to the overall revenue decline. Starting with hardware, consumer and commercial units were down 23% and 15% year-over-year, respectively. 
Overall, we were strategically focused on shaping the installed base with high-usage units, while also maintaining pricing discipline. As a result, we saw sequential improvement in constant currency ASPs in the inkjet and laser hardware portfolio, but units were down. When that was combined with channel inventory corrections, we lost 3 points of total share year-over-year in calendar fourth quarter. We gained 1 point of share in value multifunction laser printers and achieved share gains in design and large-format industrial printers.  Ink in the Office hardware units were down year-over-year, primarily due to managing sell-in volumes ahead of our product Refresh in the spring.
Turning to supplies. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year, as reported, or 8% in constant currency and comprised 57% of the total print revenue. Supplies channel inventory was slightly above the range, but we reduced the inventory dollar value both year-over-year and sequentially. Although the business remain challenged, we made solid progress on our core and growth initiatives. 
In managed services, our new business total contract value was up double digits year-over-year, as reported, and our renewal rates remained strong. In Q1, we secured a significant new logo win with John Hopkins to produce over 20 million pages monthly. We saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, increasing enrollees over 30% sequentially. And graphics revenue grew once again year-over-year in constant currency. Contributing to this performance was a win with Quantum Group, a print service provider who replaced its digital printing portfolio with a fleet of HP Indigo digital presses in order to accelerate turnaround time, increase quality and productivity and provide customers with enhanced application options.
Now on an update for restructuring.  In Q1, about 400 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in September. As Dion mentioned, we are accelerating the program and now expect approximately 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal '16 instead of over 3 years.  In addition, we are driving significant nonlabor savings from non-revenue-generating operations in the second half of the year. The acceleration of the employee exits, and some of the incremental nonlabor savings will drive GAAP-only charges and associated cash payments of approximately $300 million in the current year. The labor actions will provide gross annual savings of approximately the same amount on a run-rate basis beginning in fiscal 2017.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow was disappointing, with cash used in operations of $108 million and free cash flow used of $228 million. Note that these results include separation cash payments of $78 million. We expected to generate free cash flow of about $300 million in Q1. The primary reason for the missed expectation was due to the actual revenue coming in lower particularly in Personal Systems, driving accounts payable and volume-sensitive accrued liabilities lower at quarter-end.  
The cash conversion cycle increased 4 days sequentially to negative 15 days. This was primarily driven by a decrease of 11 days of payables, driven by unfavorable linearity, volume and supplier mix in Personal Systems. The pressure on the cash conversion cycle from DPO was partially offset by improvements in DSO and DOI.
The cash flow headwind in Q1 is mostly a timing issue due to the negative cash conversion cycle of this business. The only permanent impact to cash flow is from cash earnings on the reduced revenue. But because Personal Systems is slower to recover than originally assumed, we have implemented very targeted actions in an effort to positively impact each of the working capital metrics in order to offset the Q1 results and preserve the normalized free cash flow commitment for the full year. For example, we see opportunities to reduce inventory through better demand-supply matching, to increase DPO by extensions of payable terms and better purchasing linearity within each quarter. 
Given the acceleration of our restructuring activities, our fiscal '16 free cash flow outlook will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, a reduction of $100 million from our prior outlook. The updated outlook now assumes approximately $300 million for separation and $300 million for restructuring activity payments. We expect to retain our normalized annual free cash flow in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion.
We repurchased 67 million shares in the quarter and paid $221 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of just over $1 billion. For the full year, we are on track to return 75% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Looking forward, there are a few assumptions we've made in our financial outlook for Q2, specifically. In printing, we will continue to be strategic in placing hardware units, with a focus on those that yield high supplies usage over time, and we'll continue our pricing discipline. We expect this to yield a double-digit decline in hardware units year-over-year. 
Our reported supplies revenue is expected to decline double digits year-over-year, which is incorporated in our outlook of the stabilization in constant currency by the end of 2017.
In graphics, we expect some softness in demand ahead of Drupa, the largest graphics printing trade show, consistent with the trends we have experienced in the past years leading up to this event, which occurs just once every 4 years.
For fiscal 2016, in Personal Systems and printing, we expect our year-over-year revenue decline to moderate throughout the year, with improving market dynamics and lower channel inventory reductions. And our productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring activities supports significant improvement in profitability in the second half.
With all that in mind, I will provide our earnings outlook for continuing operations. 
Our Q2 '16 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Our Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38. And we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share is in the range of $1.52 to $1.62.
With that, let's open it up to questions."

Look, as we've said, tough market conditions we expected that, we outlined that at the security analyst meeting, and we expect that for several quarters ahead. We broadly agree with IDC's predictions of the market sort of mid-single-digit declines. However, we see in the back half of this year that revenue will begin to improve as the technology improves and as channel inventory works its way out of the system. It's a continuous evolution. As market leaders, we are looking to evolve and create new categories. Look at the work we did this week in Mobile World Congress with the Elite x3. That's a terrific example of category creation. That's a new mobile solution. But it's not a PC. It's not a phablet. It's not a notebook. It's all 3. So the PC lines are kind of being redrawn at the moment. And our goal, as it has been consistently for the past 3 years, is to gain profitable share. We choose to play in certain areas, we choose not to play in other areas. So we have a fairly consistent formula here. We segment the market. We figure out where to play, where not to play. We continue to take costs out of the system. We continue to drive innovation into the system, and we're not after share for share's sake. I would say that Windows 10, whilst I still believe is a tremendous operating system platform and universal apps and continue computing make devices like the Elite x3 a reality, we have not yet seen the anticipated Windows 10 stimulation of demand that we would have hoped for. And we're carefully monitoring any sort of price developments that could further weaken demand. So we're operating in still a large market. The big guys are getting bigger, and we think there is opportunity in that landscape."

As we talked about before, the key elements of how we're going to drive supplies revenue over time, the first is basically looking at the installed base, and looking at the installed base from a perspective of total size, to Dion's point, increasing the installed base by taking more costs out so that we can place units that are marginal today, that can be profitable in the future, is important. But it's also important to look at what the mix is within that installed base, which is the second box, which is around usage, and that's really focusing on placing higher-usage units. Then you also going to look at what your position is from a market share perspective. And we talked about -- I think Dion talked in his prepared remarks about the fact that we have a multipronged approach to drive increasing market share. Aftermarket share -- sorry, aftermarket supplies share with online, more feet on the street, but also driving Instant Ink adoption in our develop markets. We have in fact expanded our market to now include Spain and Canada, to continue to drive managed print services where we get a very high HP supplies attached.

Dion, I wanted to just clarify and push you a little bit on supply. So when you guys talk about supply stabilizing at the end of 2017, that means that they will stop declining, so 0% growth or better. I just want to be sure I understand that. But more importantly, if I look at your hardware -- printer hardware revenues, they've declined for 18 out of the last 19 quarters. That's probably the best proxy for the first 2 boxes in your 4-box model, which is the installed base and the quality of the installed base, which is the function of revenue. If I think about the third part of your 4-box model, which is aftermarket share, you just conceded that aftermarket share actually declined this quarter. And my belief is, over the last 5 years, it's also gone down. So if I think about, in the fourth part of your 4-box model around the new platform, quite frankly, given that it's -- only applies to laser and that's less than half of your profits in IPG, I don't think it's big enough to move it. So I guess the question is what am I missing? I know the 4-box model sort of sounds very logical, and it is very logical. But when I systematically step through the pieces and say we've had 19 -- 18 out of 19 quarters of down hardware, aftermarket's going in the wrong direction, what am I missing that drives stabilization 6 quarters from now?"

So the 4-box model is a predictive tool, and we use it extensively. It has a lot of complexity built into it. Not all units are created equally. We have -- we can place a particular unit in one demographic, place exactly the same unit in a different demographic. And it can yield an entirely different usage pattern, and we can have a different price associated with it. So when you think about all the permutations and combinations associated with that 4-box model, it is something that we focus on very carefully. And it shapes the way we place units, it informs how we price, and it even informs how we market. As we stated on last quarter's earnings, we expected the units to be down and that we're indeed down this quarter. Some of that was quite intentional, as we've already outlined. But characterizing the -- what I refer to as the new normal in a market environment where we think the currencies are going to continue to put downward pressure on pricing, what we structurally need to do is to take costs out of the system so that we can put marginal units back into the plan. So we are really focused on placing good units into the plan, those that are MPV-positive, taking costs out of our operations, particularly in the areas of nonrevenue-generating activities, and that will benefit us more in the second half than in the first half and that will enable us to put those units back in so it sort of addresses the first box. Managing those inventory levels was a key start to getting that done, and we did that in quarter 1. Then we said we have to turn to stimulating demand and driving price discipline into the market, and we did that. So some of the proof points, I think, as you look to evaluate the model is what's actually happening as a result of that. Our MPS business is continuing to grow in constant currency. Instant Ink grew 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that is, of course, our subscription-based service that's really important to address the declining home segment market. And the adoption rates there and the retention rates there are incredibly high. Our Graphics business is growing. Our ASPs improved quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. And areas of multifunction printers and high-value units also grew. With regards to aftermarket share, which is one of the other boxes that you referred to, competitors are pretty keen to understand what we're going to do here as well, so I'll remain at a relatively high level as I talk about this. The actions that we're taking vary geography by geography. They're very targeted. They're very segmented, as you would expect us to do. It's informed by big data wherever possible. We're increasing our supplies sales specialists in all of the regions and changing the marketing mix and where we spend marketing dollars to drive aftermarket supplies and sell the value of our HP original supplies. And we're reshaping the MBOs of the leadership team as well as the commission structures for our organization. And so there's some very comprehensive things afoot that gives us confidence that our supplies will return or stabilize in constant currency by the end of 2017."

It was down 0.6%, but the gross margin in that business was up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Because what was happening is that we had a significant currency headwind, 7 points of currency, and we had some opportunity but not, to the full extent of currency, to reprice. And so what this team really did, which was very positive, was that they managed the mix. And they managed the mix of the products and they also managed the attached, so that, in fact, ASPs were flatter, you could say up ever so slightly on a year-over-year basis. So the real pressure on the Personal Systems operating profit came from the volume declines and the pressure on the more fixed nature of the OpEx."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today. We've completed the first quarter as HP Inc. And while we continued to face macroeconomic and market headwinds, we are executing to the plan we laid out at our Security Analysts Meeting last September. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through our planned quarterly dividend and aggressive share buybacks, taking advantage of the stock price.
And while revenue continued to be challenged by market contraction in PCs and core printing, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in APJ and in strategic growth segments of the portfolio, including commercial mobility, retail solutions, graphics and services. Cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, driven by changes in working capital, which was impacted by lower personal systems volume. We've taken immediate actions to stay on track to deliver our full year commitment. Cathie will walk you through those details in just a few minutes. 
As you consider our financial performance for the quarter, remember that we operate in mature markets. This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and out execute our competitors.
A key driver of success in competitive markets is product innovation and differentiation. Innovation is the lifeblood of HP. This year at CES, we had an outstanding show of new products and took home more than a dozen awards for products like the EliteBook Folio, the world's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook. Demonstrating the consumerization of IT, we took best of show for a business-class product because it has the rugged features needed for mobile workers, but the sleek and stylish design that, ""Let's face it, we all want."" As the global commercial PC leader, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, and it's exciting to see the market's reaction to our progress.
Earlier this week, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced the HP Elite x3, a revolutionary category-creating mobile solution that brings together mobility and computing in a truly meaningful way. Some in the industry are calling it a new standard for commercial mobility. Running the Windows 10 mobile platform, the HP Elite x3 unites phablet, laptop and desktop experiences into a single device.  Along with its accessories, it's truly the one device that's every device, enabling users to scale from simple texting to spreadsheets and PowerPoint to utilizing corporate applications. With our strong channel partners and the latest advancements from Microsoft, Qualcomm and Salesforce, we are turning the promise of mobile productivity into reality for our business customers.
In printing, we launched the PageWide Excel product in our graphics portfolio for our initial entry in the technical production market. These fast, large-format mono and color printers are expected to disrupt a $1 billion market and achieve a leading share position.
Targeting the SMB segment in emerging markets, we launched the DeskJet GT, a continuous ink-supply system printer, to meet the needs of these high-usage customers. 
In the coming months, you can expect to see a refresh of inkjet products and the completion of the jet intelligence laser portfolio, Refresh. We are also planning to make other strategic announcements around 3D printing.
Our product portfolio across the board is our best ever, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as the markets steadily improve.
Before I go into business performance, let me remind you of our objectives going in the quarter. First, in addition to continuing to solution the productivity initiatives shared at SAM last September on our Q4 earnings call, we said we would materially change our nonrevenue-generating cost structure to allow us to compete more effectively in these competitive markets. Not only are the $1 billion of productivity initiatives on track, but we are accelerating the restructuring program, also announced at SAM, by increasing the fiscal '16 employee reductions to approximately 3,000. I believe there may be even more opportunity to reduce cost and streamline processes, and we will share details when finalized.
Second, we said we would balance our pricing actions with marketing and sales activity to both stimulate demand, to drive price stability the market. The outcome for printing hardware was a sequential increase in ASPs overall. And while this approach also contributed significantly to the unit decline, our working assumption is that this will ultimately result in an improved competitive environment.
And in Personal Systems, we said we will continue to shift our mix to the high end and walk away from negative margin business. During the quarter, the team executed this strategy very well, offsetting headwinds and maintaining ASPs and flat gross margin year-over-year. 
Lastly, we said we would invest in strategic growth initiatives beyond the core, and we've made solid progress in areas such as commercial mobility and graphics. And our plans are on track for 3D and A3.
Now turning to the segments. We saw mixed results across the portfolio. Starting with Personal Systems, I am pleased with our performance as we outgrew the market profitably and maintained our #1 position in commercial, with an all-time high share of 24% in calendar fourth quarter of 2015.  
We held our strong leadership position in workstations with almost 42% share and regain the #1 spot in mobile workstations. The overall PC market was slower to recover than expected, but we continued to execute, manage our channel inventory and improve product mix.
We both defended our existing business and won new opportunities from incumbents. For example, we closed a large U.K. public sector contract, retaining desktop product business and beating all the key competitors. And we won back significant business with one of the world's largest multinational banking and financial service firms with our commercial EliteBook. 
Just as importantly, we made progress on our key growth initiatives beyond the core. Commercial mobility, which includes tablets and detachables, grew strong double digits year-over-year, and we are seeing continued momentum with the recent launch of the Elite x2 detachable.
Turning to printing. In quarter 1, many of the challenges we discussed on the Q4 earnings call continued as expected. Let me remind you of the competitive advantage the Japanese printing vendors have associated with the weakness of the yen, which allowed them to price more aggressively. Further market contraction compounded this situation. We also experienced weakness in emerging markets and tough economic conditions in key countries. As we said in Q4, we consider this to be the new normal, and we are executing to our plan. 
Let me first discuss the core business results, starting with hardware units: which were down 20% year-over-year.  Approximately 7 points of the decline were the result of our pricing actions that drove higher average selling prices in constant currency. About 4 points were due to the reduction of hardware channel inventory. We effectively managed the channel with less promotional dollars, and as a result, our sellout share trends were better than our sell-in share trends. Worldwide inventory levels are healthy going into quarter 2.  About 3 points were associated with marginal units that we chose not to place as we worked more costs out of the system. And the remainder can be attributed to overall market contraction.
Shifting to supplies. The year-over-year revenue was down 8% in constant currency. The factors driving the decline that were expected going into the quarter were installed-base erosion from declining hardware sales and channel inventory adjustments. The factors that varied from our plan where pricing and aftermarket share. Supplies pricing was up, given adjustments we made to offset some of the unfavorable currency, but not as much as planned given necessary discounting in the quarter to combat aftermarket alternatives. Our aftermarket share was more pressured than expected for toner.
So what are we doing about it? We know the levers required to drive stability in a profitable supply revenue stream. We need to build back the hardware installed base with the shift to high-value units. Cost actions are in progress and on track so that we can place more of the marginal units profitably going forward. We need to win back aftermarket share, and we are already executing actions to support an aggressive share improvement plan, including online programs, and increased sales coverage to promote the value of original supplies. And we continue to strategically monitor supplies pricing so the currency adjustments don't result in increased aftermarket alternatives pressure. Despite the market headwinds, with our mitigation plans, we remain confident in our outlook for supplies revenues in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017.
In addition to optimizing the core print business, we plan to continue to drive progress in our strategic areas, including graphics and managed print services, both of which grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency. As we said at SAM, we have tough quarters ahead, and while we are making progress, we have more work to do. I remain confident in the future. We have a strong product lineup, a powerful innovation road map and a proven ability to take costs out of the business.
Now I'll turn it over to Cathie to go through more details and provide our financial outlook."

Turning to the P&L results. Q1 performance was largely as expected. And overall, we are making progress against the strategy we laid out at SAM. At the company level, we reported net revenue of $12.2 billion, down 12% year-over-year or 5% at constant currency. While the EMEA and Americas regions continued to decline, we saw constant currency revenue growth in APJ, driven by strength in Personal Systems. We had a favorable impact due to onetime release of deferred revenue related to legacy HP Financial Services business, now that our engagement is no longer intracompany. This was accounted for in corporate elimination.
Gross margin of 18.7% was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in print, partially offset by benign commodity costs and favorable mix in Personal Systems. Gross margin was down 0.6 points sequentially due to weak currencies and print mix, combined with continued competitive pricing. 
Operating profit of 7.5% was down 0.4 points year-over-year, driven by print gross margins and loss of operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 14% year-over-year, primarily due to corporate governance costs related to HP Co. and currency. With a net expense of $94 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range.
This result excluded charges of $20 million for restructuring and $8 million for amortization of intangible assets, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million.  
On a GAAP basis, Q1 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.36.
Turning to the segments. In Personal Systems, we continued to execute well against the tough market backdrop. In Q1, we delivered net revenue of $7.5 billion, down 13% year-over-year, as reported, or 6% in constant currency. 
In calendar fourth quarter, the overall PC market experienced steep declines, with units down 11% year-over-year according to IDC. The market contraction created a very competitive pricing environment and a battle for share gains. HP gained PC units share across all 3 regions, exceeding 20% share worldwide for the first time ever. As Dion said, we were very focused on higher-margin PC opportunities in strategic premium categories, including 2-in-1s, mobile workstations, thin clients, retail solutions and gaming.
Our consumer premium category, where we are #1 among all Windows OEMs, continued to grow and gained over 4 points of share year-over-year. And our consumer gaming business is on track to double revenue by year-end. 
Amidst this competitive pricing environment, the team executed well by holding ASPs flat sequentially. Year-over-year, currency headwinds were offset by favorable mix, pricing and the increased attach of higher-configuration options, displays and services.
Operating profit was 3.1%, down 0.4 points year-over-year due to loss of operating expense leverage and currency weakness, partially offset by favorable commodity costs, pricing and mix.
Now on to print. Printing remained challenged in the quarter with net revenue of $4.6 billion, down 17% year-over-year, as reported, or 11% in constant currency, with declines in all regions. Emerging markets were particularly weak due to currency devaluation and overall economic slowdown. 
Operating profit was 17%, down 1.8 points year-over-year, due to the unfavorable currency and pricing environment, combined with loss of operating expense leverage, partially offset by favorable mix.
Beyond the currency headwinds of 6 points, both hardware sales and supplies performance contributed to the overall revenue decline. Starting with hardware, consumer and commercial units were down 23% and 15% year-over-year, respectively. 
Overall, we were strategically focused on shaping the installed base with high-usage units, while also maintaining pricing discipline. As a result, we saw sequential improvement in constant currency ASPs in the inkjet and laser hardware portfolio, but units were down. When that was combined with channel inventory corrections, we lost 3 points of total share year-over-year in calendar fourth quarter. We gained 1 point of share in value multifunction laser printers and achieved share gains in design and large-format industrial printers.  Ink in the Office hardware units were down year-over-year, primarily due to managing sell-in volumes ahead of our product Refresh in the spring.
Turning to supplies. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year, as reported, or 8% in constant currency and comprised 57% of the total print revenue. Supplies channel inventory was slightly above the range, but we reduced the inventory dollar value both year-over-year and sequentially. Although the business remained challenged, we made solid progress on our core and growth initiatives. 
In managed services, our new business total contract value was up double digits year-over-year, as reported, and our renewal rates remained strong. In Q1, we secured a significant new logo win with John Hopkins to produce over 20 million pages monthly. We saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, increasing enrollees over 30% sequentially. And graphics revenue grew once again year-over-year in constant currency. Contributing to this performance was a key win with Quantum Group, a print service provider who replaced its digital printing portfolio with a fleet of HP Indigo digital presses in order to accelerate turnaround time, increase quality and productivity and provide customers with enhanced application options.
Now on an update for restructuring.  In Q1, about 400 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in September. As Dion mentioned, we are accelerating the program and now expect approximately 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal '16 instead of over 3 years.  In addition, we are driving significant nonlabor savings from non-revenue-generating operations in the second half of the year. The acceleration of the employee exits, and some of the incremental nonlabor savings will drive GAAP-only charges and associated cash payments of approximately $300 million in the current year. The labor actions will provide gross annual savings of approximately the same amount on a run-rate basis beginning in fiscal 2017.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow was disappointing, with cash used in operations of $108 million and free cash flow used of $228 million. Note that these results include separation cash payments of $78 million. We expected to generate free cash flow of about $300 million in Q1. The primary reason for the missed expectation was due to the actual revenue coming in lower particularly in Personal Systems, driving accounts payable and volume-sensitive accrued liabilities lower at quarter-end.  
The cash conversion cycle increased 4 days sequentially to negative 15 days. This was primarily driven by a decrease of 11 days of payables, driven by unfavorable linearity, volume and supplier mix in Personal Systems. The pressure on the cash conversion cycle from DPO was partially offset by improvements in DSO and DOI.
The cash flow headwind in Q1 is mostly a timing issue due to the negative cash conversion cycle of this business. The only permanent impact to cash flow is from cash earnings on the reduced revenue. But because Personal Systems is slower to recover than originally assumed, we have implemented very targeted actions in an effort to positively impact each of the working capital metrics in order to offset the Q1 results and preserve the normalized free cash flow commitment for the full year. For example, we see opportunities to reduce inventory through better demand-supply matching, to increase DPO by extensions of payable terms and better purchasing linearity within each quarter. 
Given the acceleration of our restructuring activities, our fiscal '16 free cash flow outlook will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, a reduction of $100 million from our prior outlook. The updated outlook now assumes approximately $300 million for separation and $300 million for restructuring activity payments. We expect to retain our normalized annual free cash flow in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion.
We repurchased 67 million shares in the quarter and paid $221 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of just over $1 billion. For the full year, we are on track to return 75% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Looking forward, there are a few assumptions we've made in our financial outlook for Q2, specifically. In printing, we will continue to be strategic in placing hardware units, with a focus on those that yield high supplies usage over time, and we'll continue our pricing discipline. We expect this to yield a double-digit decline in hardware units year-over-year. 
Our reported supplies revenue is expected to decline double digits year-over-year, which is incorporated in our outlook of the stabilization in constant currency by the end of 2017.
In graphics, we expect some softness in demand ahead of Drupa, the largest graphics printing trade show, consistent with the trends we have experienced in the past years leading up to this event, which occurs just once every 4 years.
For fiscal 2016, in Personal Systems and printing, we expect our year-over-year revenue decline to moderate throughout the year, with improving market dynamics and lower channel inventory reductions. And our productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring activities supports significant improvement in profitability in the second half.
With all that in mind, I will provide our earnings outlook for continuing operations. 
Our Q2 '16 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Our Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38. And we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.52 to $1.62.
With that, let's open it up to questions."

Look, as we've said, tough market conditions we expected that, we outlined that at the security analyst meeting, and we expect that for several quarters ahead. We broadly agree with IDC's predictions of the market sort of mid-single-digit declines. However, we see in the back half of this year that revenue will begin to improve as the technology improves and as channel inventory works its way out of the system. It's a continuous evolution. As market leaders, we are looking to evolve and create new categories. Look at the work we did this week in Mobile World Congress with the Elite x3. That's a terrific example of category creation. That's a new mobile solution. But it's not a PC. It's not a phablet. It's not a notebook. It's all 3. So the PC lines are kind of being redrawn at the moment. And our goal, as it has been consistently for the past 3 years, is to gain profitable share. We choose to play in certain areas, we choose not to play in other areas. So we have a fairly consistent formula here. We segment the market. We figure out where to play, where not to play. We continue to take costs out of the system. We continue to drive innovation into the system, and we're not after share for share's sake. I would say that Windows 10, whilst I still believe is a tremendous operating system platform and universal apps and continue computing make devices like the Elite x3 a reality, we have not yet seen the anticipated Windows 10 stimulation of demand that we would have hoped for. And we're carefully monitoring any sort of price developments that could further weaken demand. So we're operating in still a large market. The big guys are getting bigger, and we think there is opportunity in that landscape."

As we talked about before, the key elements of how we're going to drive supplies revenue over time, the first is basically looking at the installed base, and looking at the installed base from a perspective of total size, to Dion's point, increasing the installed base by taking more costs out so that we can place units that are marginal today, that can be profitable in the future, is important. But it's also important to look at what the mix is within that installed base, which is the second box, which is around usage, and that's really focusing on placing higher-usage units. Then you also going to look at what your position is from a market share perspective. And we talked about -- I think Dion talked in his prepared remarks about the fact that we have a multipronged approach to drive increasing market share. Aftermarket share -- sorry, aftermarket supplies share with online, more feet on the street, but also driving Instant Ink adoption in our developed markets. We have in fact expanded our market to now include Spain and Canada, to continue to drive managed print services where we get a very high HP supplies attached.

Dion, I wanted to just clarify and push you a little bit on supply. So when you guys talk about supply stabilizing at the end of 2017, that means that they will stop declining, so 0% growth or better. I just want to be sure I understand that. But more importantly, if I look at your hardware -- printer hardware revenues, they've declined for 18 out of the last 19 quarters. That's probably the best proxy for the first 2 boxes in your 4-box model, which is the installed base and the quality of the installed base, which is the function of revenue. If I think about the third part of your 4-box model, which is aftermarket share, you just conceded that aftermarket share actually declined this quarter. And my belief is, over the last 5 years, it's also gone down. So if I think about, in the fourth part of your 4-box model around the new platform, quite frankly, given that it's -- only applies to laser and that's less than half of your profits in IPG, I don't think it's big enough to move it. So I guess the question is what am I missing? I know the 4-box model sort of sounds very logical, and it is very logical. But when I systematically step through the pieces and say we've had 19 -- 18 out of 19 quarters of down hardware, aftermarket's going in the wrong direction, what am I missing that drives stabilization 6 quarters from now?"

So the 4-box model is a predictive tool, and we use it extensively. It has a lot of complexity built into it. Not all units are created equally. We have -- we can place a particular unit in one demographic, place exactly the same unit in a different demographic. And it can yield an entirely different usage pattern, and we can have a different price associated with it. So when you think about all the permutations and combinations associated with that 4-box model, it is something that we focus on very carefully. And it shapes the way we place units, it informs how we price, and it even informs how we market. As we stated on last quarter's earnings, we expected the units to be down and that we're indeed down this quarter. Some of that was quite intentional, as we've already outlined. But characterizing the -- what I refer to as the new normal in a market environment where we think the currencies are going to continue to put downward pressure on pricing, what we structurally need to do is to take costs out of the system so that we can put marginal units back into the plan. So we are really focused on placing good units into the plan, those that are MPV-positive, taking costs out of our operations, particularly in the areas of nonrevenue-generating activities, and that will benefit us more in the second half than in the first half and that will enable us to put those units back in so it sort of addresses the first box. Managing those inventory levels was a key start to getting that done, and we did that in quarter 1. Then we said we have to turn to stimulating demand and driving price discipline into the market, and we did that. So some of the proof points, I think, as you look to evaluate the model is what's actually happening as a result of that. Our MPS business is continuing to grow in constant currency. Instant Ink grew 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that is, of course, our subscription-based service that's really important to address the declining home segment market. And the adoption rates there and the retention rates there are incredibly high. Our Graphics business is growing. Our ASPs improved quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. And areas of multifunction printers and high-value units also grew. With regards to aftermarket share, which is one of the other boxes that you referred to, competitors are pretty keen to understand what we're going to do here as well, so I'll remain at a relatively high level as I talk about this. The actions that we're taking vary geography by geography. They're very targeted. They're very segmented, as you would expect us to do. It's informed by big data wherever possible. We're increasing our supplies sales specialists in all of the regions and changing the marketing mix and where we spend marketing dollars to drive aftermarket supplies and sell the value of our HP original supplies. And we're reshaping the MBOs of the leadership team as well as the commission structures for our organization. And so there's some very comprehensive things afoot that gives us confidence that our supplies will return or stabilize in constant currency by the end of 2017."

Because what was happening is that we had a significant currency headwind, 7 points of currency, and we had some opportunity but not, to the full extent of currency, to reprice. And so what this team really did, which was very positive, was that they managed the mix. And they managed the mix of the products and they also managed the attached, so that, in fact, ASPs were flatter, you could say up ever so slightly on a year-over-year basis.

108856,337225167,992190,"HP Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Diana, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41 above our previously provided outlook range.",1476,"Thank you, Diana, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41 above our previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook. And we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ, for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency revenue growth with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. 
I will not be completely satisfied with company performance until we return to sustained growth. Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the solid progress we're making against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future. Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. First, we said the markets were going to be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY '16 through productivity initiatives and acceleration of our 3-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 headcount year-to-date and are on track to achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity. 
Second, we said we would be rational in how we price our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement, we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market. Third, we said we will continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year in Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, managed print services and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly. 
A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation coming out of HP, supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most. Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust is this printing lineup with more than 15 the new PageWide OfficeJet pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the in-store base towards units with higher supplies usage. 
As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when securities is essential to customers, HP has stronger security protection available in the industry. In our graphics business. Drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just one week away and we are planning several exciting announcements. Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to address customer needs as they shift to digital. And we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry. And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement, which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Siemens, among others. 
The new HP Jet Fusion 3D Printing solutions produced superior physical parts up to 10x faster and at half the cost of the current 3D printings systems. Our products delivered the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leverage decades of HP's owned and print expertise and thousands of patents from our call. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and we'll continue to grow our ecosystem with codevelopment and technology partners in powerful industries like automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods. 
In Personal Systems. We continue to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our most recent announcements of the HP Specter, the world's thinnest laptops. We introduced this beautiful product at The New York Times Luxury show in Paris to rave reviews. We grew double-digits year-over-year in this profitable segment while the broader consumer premium market declined. Among other highlights in Personal Systems. We've reinvented the Chromebook to be ultrathin for home and office, and announced that with Google early in April. Commanding a higher selling price, is modern thin and light device offers quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multilayered security and the ability to share and access information anywhere. It's also the first to use a 6-generation Intel core M processor. 
With our superior product lineup, we continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems. We executed well against a challenging market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains while gaining momentum in key growth markets. In the core, we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commensal readership to new all-time high position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all 3 regions. We maintained our #1 share position in worldwide desktop stations at 45.6% and grew our #1 share in mobile workstations to 38.9%. 
And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as the tangibles, commercial services and consumer displays, all very profitable businesses. Personal Systems operating profit improved to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche post DHL group, the world's leading logistics group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products, including EliteBooks, extra tablets, Chromebooks and displays. Now turning to Printing. In line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued but was approximately flat, sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points year-over-year. 
We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in supplies revenue. And in Q2, all elements of the supply small box model performed largely as expected. Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and as I mentioned earlier, these actions did pressure total unit sales. However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive MPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware. 
As I always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the installed base is important. Over time, we are working to shift the installed base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print hardware while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers. Also, we continue to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We started to see progress and expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service had another quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates. Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
Beyond the core, we have solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth, supported by strength in large format design, production and services. The terrific win was with Staples where we supported their entire graphic solutions business with technologies ranging from design to graphics to latex, to flatware systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in the service delivery. 
Before I turn it over to Cathy, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP where we delivered solid progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations and grew in strategic areas of our business. I'm confident in our ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth. 
I'll now hand it over to Cathy who will share additional details, including our financial outlook."

Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency.

Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvement and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter largely in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due to the use of discontinued operations bases of accounting, from historical expenses, primarily in admin, were fully allocated to the parent company which was  HP Inc. in the U.S. Also in Q2 '16, we recorded a gain in SG&A from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our overall cost structure. 
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million, lower than normal run rate due to a onetime benefit from a legal settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY '16 annual financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full-year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2. With the non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38 primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only, partially offset by nonoperating retirement related credits of $40 million. Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise company. 
We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter, and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. Now turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 16% while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline. Innovations of cost of portfolio have been well received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum of the Elite x2 commercial mobility product, which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming. 
Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly year-over-year but improved sequentially due to favorable mix, partially offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems operating profit was 3.5%, up a 0.6 points year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year, but not in line with revenue decline. Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. Hardware units were down slightly sequentially, but better than normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the number of units that were now at a positive MPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive MPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio, which will support our hardware strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attached. 
Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. Considering currency and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the quarter, which was a 7-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, supplies revenue mix was 67% flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range. Operating profit for printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by operational improvement, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of certain marketing optimization software asset, helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter. 
Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800 people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1,200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activity is on track and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a 9-day sequential improvement, driven by a 6-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics. We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high-end of our original 50% to 75% target range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year. Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect the year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems in printing. Also, in printing, the progress we are making on our cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units. Hardware unit declines will moderate, although we still expect low double-digit decline year-over-year. 
Supplies revenue in constant currency will continue to decline, but is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as compared to the first half of the year. With all that in mind, Q3 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58. 
With that let's open it up for questions."

In terms of us being on the trajectory that leads to stabilization in constant currency supplies revenue by the end of '17. And I believe Dion said in his prepared remarks that when we started the quarter, we have an expectation of what the 4 box -- the different elements of the 4 box model is going to do. And then based on the models that we had, and then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality. And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter -- within a quarter is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that. In terms of the channel inventory corrections. Off the top of my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter. We did have some -- we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well. But this quarter was larger and it was 7 points of the headwind. So if you look at the -- if you look at this, you look at supplies growth of -- or a decline of about 16%. You take off about 6 points of currency, 7 points of channel inventory. If you look at kind of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%. Again, in line with what we were expecting."
108856,337225167,992190,"HP Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","And just to give you my perspective on this. What I'm most happy about is we did exactly what we said we would do. And what was happening in the market and what we thought was going to happen in the market has actually transpired.

And what was happening in the market and what we thought was going to happen in the market has actually transpired. We simply needed to adjust to what I call the new normal and that was a combination of further market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that we saw weakness in emerging markets and we did indeed, see that continue. Currency continued as a headwind. And we were expecting tough macro economic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal. And you'll remember on our fourth quarter earnings call -- our first quarter earnings call, we talked about having to not only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements. But actually, that wasn't going to be enough and that we were going to need to do more. And we are on track to doing more than that $1 billion. We also said that we needed to accelerate our restructuring. And in Kathy's prepared remarks, she said we are also on track to doing that and that we needed to persist with our efforts to drive's price stability in that market. So all of that is actually working out. Supples trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had. Supplies inventory is now back within the range it is globally. And that's obviously, where we wanted to be. So we -- with all of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the installed base. We're focusing on high-value units. That's evidenced through the continued growth in value multifunction laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the product lineup. We did that 15 new devices launched last quarter JetIntelligence, PageWide array, Office Jet Pro. And we said we needed to compete and grow our graphics business and we did for the 11th consecutive quarter in the row as we did with inc.

And therefore, with all of that, we expect to stabilize our supplies of revenue trajectory by the end of FY -- by the end of '17."

And I know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And your assertion that supply should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me. And so if we look at last night quarter's, part of revenue has been down double-digits, part of revenue has been down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the 4-box model that says, what's happening to my installed base? It's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's the key thing that changes? Are you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more given their printers? But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your installed base and that's declining. So I appreciate that your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think happens in the model to go from, what's been closer to mid-single digit decline in supplies to 0 given the backdrop that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative."

And I think what's important is that we've captured -- it's not like this is a surprise to us, we captured it within the modeling that we have done.

So what we need to do is to continue to focus on all areas of the 4-box model. The installed base being 1 metric. But remember that the installed base is a function of every kind of category in the segment of business that we do from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a lot of supplies. And we are placing more MPV positive units enabled by the cost we're taking out of the business. And we're innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market. Usage is another part of the 4-box model. Not all printers are created equally. And even the same printer placed in a different location or different ZIP code produce a different amount of supply. So reshaping that installed base to higher usage of printers is kind of job number 1. The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach. And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing. And that takes care of box number 2. On the third box, the aftermarket share, you had these newer platforms that come with higher attach you got, work that we're doing around omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering on line coverage and marketing as well as the innovation that we're driving our ink formulas and new types of technology resulting in a much better printed page when you're using original HP supplies and the fourth we've -- of course, is pricing which remains flat in the system with our expectation. So all of these factors drive supplies consumption, not just the installed base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that stabilization by the end of '17 in a constant currency."

We made some really interesting category grating product announcements with the Elite x3 during the course of the quarter with Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. So lots of positive signals from the market from a product respective and the pipeline that we're building. And then of course, only last week, we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation here in solving the problems of speed, quality and cost.

I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end customer and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough we've made towards really pulling through the printing into the mainstream. We've released the first production -- short run productions for 3D printing systems. They're 10x faster than other products that are out in the marketplace. Unbelievable quality and most importantly, at half the costs. And when you get those 3 things right, you start tap into specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in analog fashion. And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the biller materials of our 3D printers are printed by our 3D printers, so our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more economically advantageous to us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing. So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex -- and alike complexity here, road map. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our printing business. And we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with the brand that HP has, the reputation that we have. So we're really excited about the market.

To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves as we're able to fit more power into small platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the continuum all the way from mobile up to workstation.

It's all about changing that continuum. So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment, we segment again. We navigate the heat of the market and we predict where we think the heat is going to be. We're constantly challenging ourselves on price, function, value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system and we have to be a massive innovator, I think we're doing all of that as well."

I think the right way to think about it is 16% decline in supplies revenue. The fact that there was 6 points of currency. So you're down to -- down 10% at constant currency, but you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction that our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory on a go-forward basis. So really, what we're looking at -- I guess, at least sometimes we referred to as the real supplies growth or decline. We're at about minus 3. And we obviously, as we go through '17, will you expect that, that will continue to improve so that it stabilizes by the end of '17. But again, largely in line with what we expected. Then from a free cash flow perspective. A couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance within the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days and we now are at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow. We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in many ways, we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that our free cash flow, on a year-to-date basis also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously, are more onetime in nature."

I am pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do.

I am pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. 
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41 above our previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook, and we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency revenue growth, with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. I will not be completely satisfied with company performance until we return to sustained growth. 
Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the solid progress we're making against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future. Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. 
First, we said the markets were going to be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY '16 through productivity initiatives and an acceleration of our 3-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 headcount year-to-date and are on track to achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity. 
Second, we said we would be rational in how we price in our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement, we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market. 
Third, we said we will continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year, in Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, managed print services and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly. 
A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation coming out of HP supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most. 
Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust business printing lineup with more than 15 new PageWide OfficeJet Pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the installed base towards units with higher supplies usage. 
As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when security is essential to customers, HP has the stronger security protection available in the industry. In our graphics business, Drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just 1 week away, and we are planning several exciting announcements. 
Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to address customer needs as they shift to digital, and we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry. And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement, which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Siemens, among others. 
The new HP Jet Fusion 3D printing solutions produce superior physical parts up to 10x faster and at half the cost of current 3D printing systems. Our products deliver the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leverage decades of HP's R&D print expertise and thousands of patents from our core. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and we'll continue to grow our ecosystem of co-development and technology partners in powerful industries like automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods. 
In Personal Systems, we continue to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our most recent announcements of the HP Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. We introduced this beautiful product at The New York Times Luxury show in Paris to rave reviews. 
We grew double-digits year-over-year in this profitable segment while the broader consumer premium market declined. Among other highlights in Personal Systems. We reinvented the Chromebook to be ultrathin for home and office and announced that with Google earlier in April. Commanding a higher-selling price, this modern, thin and light device offers quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multilayered security and the ability to share and access information anywhere. It's also the first to use a 6th generation Intel Core M Processor. 
With our superior product lineup, we continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems, we executed well against a challenging market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains, while gaining momentum in key growth markets. 
In the core, we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commercial leadership to a new all-time-high share position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all 3 regions. We maintained our #1 share position in worldwide desktop stations at 45.6% and grew our #1 share in mobile workstations to 38.9%. 
And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as detachables, commercial services and consumer displays, all very Profitable businesses. Personal Systems' operating profit improved to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. 
A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading logistics service group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products, including EliteBooks, x3 tablets, Chromebooks and Displays. 
Now turning to Printing. In line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued, but was approximately flat sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points year-over-year. 
We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in supplies revenue. And in Q2, all elements of the supply Four Box Model performed largely as expected. Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, these actions did pressure total unit sales. 
However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive MPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware. 
As I always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the installed base is important. Over time, we are working to shift the installed base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print hardware, while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers. 
Also, we continued to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We started to see progress and expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service had another quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates. 
Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
Beyond the core, we have solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth, supported by strength in large format design, production and services. The terrific win was with Staples, where we supported their entire graphic solutions business with technologies ranging from DesignJet graphics to Latex to Scitex flatbed systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in service delivery. 
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP, where we delivered solid progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations and grew in strategic areas of our business. I'm confident in our ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth. 
I'll now hand it over to Cathie, who will share additional details, including our financial outlook."

Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency.

Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvements and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter largely in line with normal seasonality. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due to the use of discontinued operations basis of accounting, some historical expenses, primarily in admin, were fully allocated to the parent company, which was  HP Inc. in the U.S. Also in Q2 '16, we recorded a gain in SG&A from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our overall cost structure. 
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million lower-than-normal run rate due to a onetime benefit from a legal settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY '16 annual financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full-year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2. 
With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38, primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million. Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. 
Now turning to the segments. Personal Systems' net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 16%, while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline. 
Innovations across the portfolio have been well received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum of the Elite x2 commercial mobility product, which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming. 
Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly year-over-year, but improved sequentially due to favorable mix, partially offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems' operating profit was 3.5%, up 0.6 points year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year, but not in line with revenue decline. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. Hardware units were down slightly sequentially, but better than normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the number of units that were now at a positive MPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive MPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio, which will support our hardware strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attach. 
Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. Considering currency and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the quarter, which was a 7-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, supplies revenue mix was 67% flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by operational improvements, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets, helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter. 
Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800 people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1,200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activities is on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a 9-day sequential improvement, driven by a 6-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics. We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems and Printing. Also, in Printing, the progress we are making on our cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units. Hardware unit declines will moderate, although we still expect low double-digit declines year-over-year. 
Supplies revenue in constant currency will continue to decline, but it's still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as compared to the first half of the year. 
With all that in mind, Q3 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58. 
With that let's open it up for questions."

And I believe Dion said it in his prepared remarks that when we started the quarter, we have an expectation of what the Four Box -- the different elements of the Four Box Model are going to do, and then -- based on the models that we have. And then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality. And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter -- within a quarter, is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that. In terms of the channel inventory correction, off the top of the -- my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter. We did have some -- we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well, but this quarter was larger and it was 7 points of the headwind. So if you look at the -- if you look at this, you look at supplies growth of -- or a decline of about 16%, you take off about 6 points of currency, 7 points of channel inventory. If you look at kind of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%, again, in line with what we were expecting."

And what has happened in the market and what we thought would happen in the market has actually transpired. We simply needed to adjust to what I call the new normal, and that was a sort of combination of further market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that we saw weakness in emerging markets and we did indeed see that continue. Currency continued as a headwind and that we were expecting tough macroeconomic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal. And you'll remember on our fourth quarter earning call and our first quarter earning call, we talked about having to not only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements, but actually that wasn't going to be enough and that we were going to need to do more. And we are on track to doing more than our $1 billion. We also said that we needed to accelerate our restructuring. And in Cathie's prepared remarks, she said we are also on track to doing that, and that we needed to persist with our efforts to drive price stability in the market. So all of that is actually working out. Supplies trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had. Supplies inventory is now back within the ranges globally, and that's obviously where we want it to be. So we -- with all of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the installed base, we're focusing on high-value units. That's evidenced through the continued growth in value multifunction laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the product lineup. We did that 15 new devices launched last quarter, JetIntelligence, PageWide Array and OfficeJet Pro. And we said we needed to continue to grow in our graphics business and we did for the 11th consecutive quarter in a row as we did with Instant Ink. So as Cathie mentioned, all of that translates to what we're seeing transpire as we planned it out to be. And therefore, with all of that, we expect to stabilize our supplies revenue trajectory by the end of FY -- by the end of '17."

And I know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And your assertion that supplies should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me. And so if we look at last 5  quarters, hardware revenue has been down double digits. Hardware revenue has been down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the Four Box Model that says, what's happening to my installed base, it's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's the key thing that changes? Are you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more given their printers? But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your installed base, and that's declining. So I appreciate that your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think happens in the model to go from what's been closer to mid-single digit declines in supplies to 0 given the backdrop that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative."

And I think what's important is that we've captured -- it's not like this is a surprise to us. We've captured it within the modeling that we have done.

And there is no single magic pill that changes the supplies trajectory. So what we need to do is to continue to focus on all areas of the Four Box Model, the installed base being 1 metric. But remember that the installed base is a function of every kind of category and segment of business that we do from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a lot of supplies. And we are placing more MPV-positive units enabled by the costs that we're taking out of the business. And we're innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market. Usage is another part of the Four Box Model. Not all printers are created equally. And even the same printer placed in a different location or a different ZIP code produce a different amount of supply. So reshaping that installed base to high-usage of printers is kind of job number one. The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach. And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing. And that sort of takes care of box number two. On the third box, the aftermarket share, you have these newer platforms that come with higher attach. You've got work we're doing around the omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering online coverage in marketing as well as the innovation that we're driving our ink formulas and new toner technology resulting in a much better printed page when you're using original HP supplies. And the fourth lever, of course, is pricing which remains flat and consistent with our expectations. So all these factors drive supplies consumption, not just the installed base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency."

So lots of positive signals from the market from a product respective and the pipeline that we're building. And then, of course, only last week, we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation here, solving the problems of speed, quality and cost. We said we would release them in the second half of this year.

And first, let me extend my congratulations to Meg and the Hewlett Packard Enterprise team on a spectacular earnings, and on a very successful announcement of the spin merger they're doing with CSC. I think what that demonstrates is that the separation and the focus of the organizations on the markets that are moving at top speed is really working. It's produced better results for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's producing solid results for us as well and it's fueling the innovation engines of both companies. So I don't want to comment much further on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's announcement, but I will say that we are really committed to the long-term success of HP. I'm very happy with the assets that we have in both Printing and Personal Systems. They're both an important -- play a very important role within our portfolio as the sort of broad things. We obviously always continue to look and reevaluate the markets as they change and measure all of our assets relative to the strategy and sometimes that results in a divestiture, and we made a divestiture this quarter and some marketing optimization assets. That's an ongoing process. But as far as our major franchises go, we're very committed to both portfolios."

It was partially offset by the productivity initiatives that we've got and the broader non-revenue-generating cost reductions as well as the favorable hardware mix. And then we had some benefit from the divestiture gains. It wasn't litigation, it was divestiture of the marketing optimization assets. But as I told you, we made the conscious decision to invest that gain back into placing incremental MPV-positive units. And you can see the impact of that, frankly, in the share gains that we had quarter-on-quarter as well as basically bringing our channel inventory levels for supplies in a bit more. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, the increase was really driven by cost improvements as well as the divestiture gain and that was partially offset by competitive pricing currency and some investments that we made in go-to-market and R&D."

I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end customers and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough we've made towards really pulling 3D printing into the mainstream. We released the first production -- short run production 3D printing systems. They're 10x faster than other products that are out on the marketplace, unbelievable quality and most importantly, at half the cost. And when you get those 3 things right, you start to tap into specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in an analog fashion. And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the bill of materials of our 3D printers are printed by our 3D printers, so our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more economically advantageous to us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing. So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex, and I like complexity here, roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our Printing business. And we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with the brand that HP has and reputation that we have. So we're really excited by the market. We're happy with the ramp we're doing on our partners and our certified channel partners. We're incredibly excited by really impressive ecosystem co-innovators with us, Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Jabil. The list goes on, both the materials as well as end customers."

I think we were one of the earliest to predict that these markets will continue to be challenged for quite some time. And as a result of that, we needed to just take immediate action to get our costs in line with where the markets were. But over the long term, we sort of genuinely broadly agree with the analysts and where they expect things to land. We see continued declines in calendar quarter 2. The market is projecting that it will improve in calendar quarter 3 and 4, and we tend to disagree. Now whether it's low single digits or mid-single digits, I guess, that's up for debate and no one's is perfect at making those predictions. But I think things are getting better. To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves as we're able to fit more power into smaller platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the continuum all the way from mobile up to workstation. And these lines are beginning to blur and that enables us to create new products and new categories like Elite x3. That technology is not going to slow down. It's only going to accelerate. So I think we've got to start looking as an industry at the entire spectrum, all the way from phones to workstations. Think about that market. Think about how those hard lines were characterized in the past and how those hard lines will begin to break down in the future. And as leaders, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, whether that be the success we're having with our x2 or the new category trend in products like x3. It's all about changing that continuum. So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment, we segment again. We navigate the heat in the market and we predict where we think the heat's going to be. We're constantly challenging ourselves on price function value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system and we have to be a massive innovator, and I think we're doing all of that as well."

On the supplies, I think the right way to think about it is a 16% decline in supplies revenue. The fact that there was 6 points of currency, so you're down to -- down 10% constant currency, but you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction that, our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory on a go-forward basis. So really, when you're looking at, I guess, we sometimes refer to as real supplies growth or decline, we're at about minus 3. And we -- obviously, as we go through '17, we expect that, that will continue to improve so that it stabilizes by the end of '17, but again, largely in line with what we expected. And then from a free cash flow perspective, a couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance within the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days and we're now at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow. We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in many ways we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that it -- our free cash flow, on a year-to-date basis, also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously, are one -- more onetime in nature."

I am pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. 
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41, above our previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook, and we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency revenue growth, with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. I will not be completely satisfied with company performance until we return to sustained growth. 
Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the solid progress we're making against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future. Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. 
First, we said the markets were going to be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY '16 through productivity initiatives and an acceleration of our 3-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 headcount year-to-date and are on track to achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity. 
Second, we said we would be rational in how we price in our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement, we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market. 
Third, we said we will continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year, in Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, managed print services and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly. 
A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation coming out of HP supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most. 
Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust business printing lineup with more than 15 new PageWide OfficeJet Pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the installed base towards units with higher supplies usage. 
As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when security is essential to customers, HP has the strongest security protection available in the industry. In our graphics business, Drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just 1 week away, and we are planning several exciting announcements. 
Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to address customer needs as they shift to digital, and we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry. And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement, which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Siemens, among others. 
The new HP Jet Fusion 3D printing solutions produce superior physical parts up to 10x faster and at half the cost of current 3D printing systems. Our products deliver the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leverage decades of HP's R&D print expertise and thousands of patents from our core. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and we'll continue to grow our ecosystem of co-development and technology partners in powerful industries like automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods. 
In Personal Systems, we continue to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our most recent announcements of the HP Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. We introduced this beautiful product at The New York Times Luxury show in Paris to rave reviews. 
We grew double-digits year-over-year in this profitable segment while the broader consumer premium market declined. Among other highlights in Personal Systems. We reinvented the Chromebook to be ultrathin for home and office and announced it with Google earlier in April. Commanding a higher-selling price, this modern, thin and light device offers quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multilayered security and the ability to share and access information anywhere. It's also the first to use a 6th generation Intel Core M Processor. 
With our superior product lineup, we continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems, we executed well against a challenging market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains, while gaining momentum in key growth markets. 
In the core, we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commercial leadership to a new all-time-high share position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all 3 regions. We maintained our #1 share position in worldwide desktop stations at 45.6% and grew our #1 share in mobile workstations to 38.9%. 
And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as detachables, commercial services and consumer displays, all very profitable businesses. Personal Systems' operating profit improved to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. 
A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading logistics service group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products, including EliteBooks, x2 tablets, Chromebooks and Displays. 
Now turning to Printing. In line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued, but was approximately flat sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points year-over-year. 
We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in supplies revenue. And in Q2, all elements of the supplies Four Box Model performed largely as expected. Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, these actions did pressure total unit sales. 
However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive MPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware. 
As I always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the installed base is important. Over time, we are working to shift the installed base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print hardware, while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers. 
Also, we continued to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We started to see progress and expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service had another quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates. 
Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
Beyond the core, we have solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth, supported by strength in large format design, production and services. The terrific win was with Staples, where we supported their entire graphic solutions business with technologies ranging from DesignJet graphics to Latex to Scitex flatbed systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in service delivery. 
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP, where we delivered solid progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations and grew in strategic areas of our business. I am confident in our ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth. 
I'll now hand it over to Cathie, who will share additional details, including our financial outlook."

Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvements and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter largely in line with normal seasonality. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due to the use of discontinued operations basis of accounting, some historical expenses, primarily in admin, were fully allocated to the parent company, which was  HP Inc. in the U.S. Also in Q2 '16, we recorded a gain in SG&A from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our overall cost structure. 
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million, lower-than-normal run rate due to a onetime benefit from a legal settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY '16 annual financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full-year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2. 
With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38, primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million. Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. 
Now turning to the segments. Personal Systems' net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 16%, while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline. 
Innovations across the portfolio have been well received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum of the Elite x2 commercial mobility product, which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming. 
Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly year-over-year, but improved sequentially due to favorable mix, partially offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems' operating profit was 3.5%, up 0.6 points year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year, but not in line with revenue decline. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. Hardware units were down slightly sequentially, but better than normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the number of units that were now at a positive MPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive MPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio, which will support our hardware strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attach. 
Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. Considering currency and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the quarter, which was a 7-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, supplies revenue mix was 67% flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by operational improvements, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets, helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter. 
Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800 people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1,200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activities is on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a 9-day sequential improvement, driven by a 6-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics. We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems and Printing. Also, in Printing, the progress we are making on our cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units. Hardware unit declines will moderate, although we still expect low double-digit declines year-over-year. 
Supplies revenue in constant currency will continue to decline, but it's still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as compared to the first half of the year. 
With all that in mind, Q3 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58. 
With that let's open it up for questions."

And then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality. And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter -- within a quarter, is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that. 
In terms of the channel inventory correction, off the top of the -- my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter. We did have some -- we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well, but this quarter was larger and it was 7 points of the headwind. So if you look at the -- if you look at this, you look at supplies growth of -- or decline of about 16%, you take off about 6 points of currency, 7 points of channel inventory. If you look at kind of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%, again, in line with what we were expecting."

And what has happened in the market and what we thought would happen in the market has actually transpired. We said we needed to adjust to what I call the new normal, and that was a sort of combination of further market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that we saw weakness in emerging markets and we did indeed see that continue. Currency continued as a headwind and that we were expecting tough macroeconomic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal. And you'll remember on our fourth quarter earning call and our first quarter earning call, we talked about having to not only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements, but actually that wasn't going to be enough and that we were going to need to do more. And we are on track to doing more than our $1 billion. We also said that we needed to accelerate our restructuring. And in Cathie's prepared remarks, she said we are also on track to doing that, and that we needed to persist with our efforts to drive price stability in the market. So all of that is actually working out. Supplies trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had. Supplies inventory is now back within the ranges globally, and that's obviously where we want it to be. 
So we -- with all of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the installed base, we're focusing on high-value units. That's evidenced through the continued growth in value multifunction laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the product lineup. We did that 15 new devices launched last quarter, JetIntelligence, PageWide Array and OfficeJet Pro. And we said we needed to continue to grow in our graphics business and we did for the 11th consecutive quarter in a row as we did with Instant Ink. So as Cathie mentioned, all of that translates to what we're seeing transpire as we planned it out to be. And therefore, with all of that, we expect to stabilize our supplies revenue trajectory by the end of FY -- by the end of '17."

And I know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And your assertion that supplies should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me. And so if we look at last 5  quarters, hardware revenue has been down double digits. Hardware revenue has been down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the Four Box Model that says, what's happening to my installed base, it's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's the key thing that changes? Are you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more given their printers? But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your installed base, and that's declining. So I appreciate that your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think happens in the model to go from what's been closer to mid-single digit declines in supplies to 0 given the backdrop that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative."

Q3 is a relatively tough compare, because if you will remember last year, we did some incremental what we called insurance policy because of the split that we were going through. So it is a tough compare. But we went from minus 20% declines in Q1 to minus 16%, and then it's going to come down further as well in Q3 of '16. And I think what's important is that we've captured -- it's not like this is a surprise to us. We've captured it within the modeling that we have done. Our models are holding up and our models basically show that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

And there is no single magic pill that changes the supplies trajectory. So what we need to do is to continue to focus on all areas of the Four Box Model, the installed base being one metric. But remember that the installed base is a function of every kind of category and segment of business that we do, from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a lot of supplies. And we are placing more MPV-positive units enabled by the costs that we're taking out of the business. And we're innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market. Usage is another part of the Four Box Model. Not all printers are created equally. And even the same printer placed in a different location or a different ZIP code produce a different amount of supplies. So reshaping that installed base to higher-usage of printers is kind of job number one. 
The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach. And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing. And that sort of takes care of box number two. 
On the third box, the aftermarket share, you have these newer platforms that come with higher attach. You've got work we're doing around the omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering online coverage in marketing as well as the innovation that we're driving our ink formulas and new toner technology resulting in a much better printed page when you're using original HP supplies. 
And the fourth lever, of course, is pricing which remains flat and consistent with our expectations. So all these factors drive supplies consumption, not just the installed base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency."

But I think we've been very disciplined in the market in terms of not dragging the market down in price, selling the value of our products shifting away from spending contra-dollars on discounting to marketing and sales, and that's resulted in higher ASPs. So we're very focused on our activities. And I think we're starting to see some signs of market stabilization."

So let me say that everything we've spoken about so far has really been focused on the core, and we're really incredibly focused on our traditional franchises of Print and Personal Systems. But as part of our overall strategy for the company, we do have certain growth areas that are incredibly important to us. You mentioned a couple of them. Our A3 product work remains on track, and our portfolio will come out towards the middle of next year. That is on time and on track and we're doing a lot of work around preparing, not only for the products, but for the go-to-market that is required in order to be successful in this marketplace. 
Another part of our growth engine is graphics. Graphics grew for the 11th consecutive quarter, and we're just about to walk into Drupa next week, which is the Olympics of the graphics business. It happens every 4 years and we're very excited about some of the products that we will be announcing at Drupa. 
And the third area is commercial mobility, and our commercial mobility practice continues to grow. We're excited by the work we're doing there. We made some really interesting category creating product announcements with the Elite x3 during the course of the quarter at Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. So lots of positive signals from the market from a product respective and the pipeline that we're building. 
And then, of course, only last week, we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation here, solving the problems of speed, quality and cost. We said we would release them in the second half of this year. And a proof point of that is the announcements that we made last week. And the strategic announcements that we made with Nike, with BMW, with Johnson & Johnson and Jabil, a very important player in this space. So I think there's a lot of markers out there that point to the execution of this team. We do what we say we're going to do, whether it's product, whether it's go-to-market or business model readiness."

So it would have been down even more year-over-year. Is the correct way to think about it is to stabilize it? Is it top line? Is it mix? Is it cost cutting?

So I don't want to comment much further on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's announcement, but I will say that we are really committed to the long-term success of HP. I'm very happy with the assets that we have in both Printing and Personal Systems. They're both an important -- play a very important role within our portfolio as the sort of broad things. We obviously always continue to look and reevaluate the markets as they change and measure all of our assets relative to the strategy and sometimes that results in a divestiture, and we made a divestiture this quarter and some marketing optimization assets.

And then we had some benefit from the divestiture gains. It wasn't litigation, it was divestiture of the marketing optimization assets. But as I told you, we made the conscious decision to invest that gain back into placing incremental MPV-positive units. And you can see the impact of that, frankly, in the share gains that we had quarter-on-quarter as well as basically bringing our channel inventory levels for supplies in a bit more. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, the increase was really driven by cost improvements as well as the divestiture gain and that was partially offset by competitive pricing, currency and some investments that we made in go-to-market and R&D."

I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end customers and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough we've made towards really pulling 3D printing into the mainstream. We released the first production -- short run production 3D printing systems. They're 10x faster than other products that are out on the marketplace, unbelievable quality and most importantly, at half the cost. And when you get those 3 things right, you start to tap into specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in an analog fashion. And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the bill of materials of our 3D printers are printed by our 3D printers, so our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more economically advantageous to us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing. So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex, and I like complexity here, roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our Printing business. And we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with the brand that HP has and reputation that we have. So we're really excited by the market. We're happy with the ramp we're doing on our partners and our certified channel partners. We're incredibly excited by really impressive ecosystem co-innovators with us, Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Jabil. The list goes on, both in the materials as well as end customers."

I think we were one of the earliest to predict that these markets will continue to be challenged for quite some time. And as a result of that, we needed to just take immediate action to get our costs in line with where the markets were. But over the long term, we sort of genuinely broadly agree with the analysts and where they expect things to land. We see continued declines in calendar quarter 2. The market is projecting that it will improve in calendar quarter 3 and 4, and we tend to disagree. Now whether it's low single digits or mid-single digits, I guess, that's up for debate and no one's is perfect at making those predictions. But I think things are getting better. 
To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves as we're able to fit more power into smaller platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the continuum all the way from mobile up to workstation. And these lines are beginning to blur and that enables us to create new products and new categories like Elite x3. That technology is not going to slow down. It's only going to accelerate. So I think we've got to start looking as an industry at the entire spectrum, all the way from phones to workstations. Think about that market. Think about how those hard lines were characterized in the past and how those hard lines will begin to break down in the future. And as leaders, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, whether that be the success we're having with our x2 or the new category trend in products like x3. It's all about changing that continuum. So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment, we segment again. We navigate the heat in the market and we predict where we think the heat's going to be. We're constantly challenging ourselves on price, function, value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system and we have to be a massive innovator, and I think we're doing all of that as well."

The fact that there was 6 points of currency, so you're down to -- down 10% constant currency, but you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction that, our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory on a go-forward basis. So really, when you're looking at, I guess, we sometimes refer to as real supplies growth or decline, we're at about minus 3. And we -- obviously, as we go through '17, we expect that, that will continue to improve so that it stabilizes by the end of '17, but again, largely in line with what we expected. 
And then from a free cash flow perspective, a couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance was in the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days and we're now at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow. We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in many ways we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that it -- our free cash flow, on a year-to-date basis, also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously, are one -- more onetime in nature."

I am pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. 
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41, above our previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook, and we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency revenue growth, with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. I will not be completely satisfied with company performance until we return to sustained growth. 
Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the solid progress we're making against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future. Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. 
First, we said the markets were going to be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY '16 through productivity initiatives and an acceleration of our 3-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 headcount year-to-date and are on track to achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity. 
Second, we said we would be rational in how we price in our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement, we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market. 
Third, we said we will continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year, in Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, managed print services and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly. 
A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation coming out of HP supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most. 
Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust business printing lineup with more than 15 new PageWide OfficeJet Pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the installed base towards units with higher supplies usage. 
As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when security is essential to customers, HP has the strongest security protection available in the industry. In our graphics business, Drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just 1 week away, and we are planning several exciting announcements. 
Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to address customer needs as they shift to digital, and we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry. And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement, which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Siemens, among others. 
The new HP Jet Fusion 3D printing solutions produce superior physical parts up to 10x faster and at half the cost of current 3D printing systems. Our products deliver the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leverage decades of HP's R&D print expertise and thousands of patents from our core. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and we'll continue to grow our ecosystem of co-development and technology partners in powerful industries like automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods. 
In Personal Systems, we continue to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our most recent announcements of the HP Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. We introduced this beautiful product at The New York Times Luxury show in Paris to rave reviews. 
We grew double-digits year-over-year in this profitable segment while the broader consumer premium market declined. Among other highlights in Personal Systems. We reinvented the Chromebook to be ultrathin for home and office and announced it with Google earlier in April. Commanding a higher-selling price, this modern, thin and light device offers quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multilayered security and the ability to share and access information anywhere. It's also the first to use a 6th generation Intel Core M Processor. 
With our superior product lineup, we continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems, we executed well against a challenging market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains, while gaining momentum in key growth markets. 
In the core, we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commercial leadership to a new all-time-high share position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all 3 regions. We maintained our #1 share position in worldwide desktop stations at 45.6% and grew our #1 share in mobile workstations to 38.9%. 
And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as detachables, commercial services and consumer displays, all very profitable businesses. Personal Systems' operating profit improved to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. 
A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading logistics service group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products, including EliteBooks, x2 tablets, Chromebooks and Displays. 
Now turning to Printing. In line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued, but was approximately flat sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points year-over-year. 
We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in supplies revenue. And in Q2, all elements of the supplies Four Box Model performed largely as expected. Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, these actions did pressure total unit sales. 
However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive MPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware. 
As I always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the installed base is important. Over time, we are working to shift the installed base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print hardware, while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers. 
Also, we continued to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We started to see progress and expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service had another quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates. 
Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
Beyond the core, we have solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth, supported by strength in large format design, production and services. The terrific win was with Staples, where we supported their entire graphic solutions business with technologies ranging from DesignJet graphics to Latex to Scitex flatbed systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in service delivery. 
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP, where we delivered solid progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations and grew in strategic areas of our business. I am confident in our ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth. 
I'll now hand it over to Cathie, who will share additional details, including our financial outlook."
108856,337225167,992883,"HP Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dion. Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by un",1135,"Thanks, Dion. Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvements and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter largely in line with normal seasonality. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due to the use of discontinued operations basis of accounting, some historical expenses, primarily in admin, were fully allocated to the parent company, which was  HP Inc. in the U.S. Also in Q2 '16, we recorded a gain in SG&A from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our overall cost structure. 
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million, lower-than-normal run rate due to a onetime benefit from a legal settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY '16 annual financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full-year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2. 
With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38, primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million. Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. 
Now turning to the segments. Personal Systems' net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 16%, while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline. 
Innovations across the portfolio have been well received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum of the Elite x2 commercial mobility product, which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming. 
Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly year-over-year, but improved sequentially due to favorable mix, partially offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems' operating profit was 3.5%, up 0.6 points year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year, but not in line with revenue decline. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. Hardware units were down slightly sequentially, but better than normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the number of units that were now at a positive MPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive MPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio, which will support our hardware strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attach. 
Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. Considering currency and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the quarter, which was a 7-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, supplies revenue mix was 67% flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by operational improvements, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets, helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter. 
Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800 people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1,200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activities is on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a 9-day sequential improvement, driven by a 6-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics. We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems and Printing. Also, in Printing, the progress we are making on our cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units. Hardware unit declines will moderate, although we still expect low double-digit declines year-over-year. 
Supplies revenue in constant currency will continue to decline, but it's still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as compared to the first half of the year. 
With all that in mind, Q3 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58. 
With that let's open it up for questions."

And I believe Dion said it in his prepared remarks that when we started the quarter, we have an expectation of what the Four Box -- the different elements of the Four Box Model are going to do, and then -- based on the models that we have. And then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality. And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter -- within a quarter, is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that. 
In terms of the channel inventory correction, off the top of the -- my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter. We did have some -- we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well, but this quarter was larger and it was 7 points of the headwind. So if you look at the -- if you look at this, you look at supplies growth of -- or decline of about 16%, you take off about 6 points of currency, 7 points of channel inventory. If you look at kind of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%, again, in line with what we were expecting."

And what has happened in the market and what we thought would happen in the market has actually transpired. We said we needed to adjust to what I call the new normal, and that was a sort of combination of further market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that we saw weakness in emerging markets and we did indeed see that continue. Currency continued as a headwind and that we were expecting tough macroeconomic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal. And you'll remember on our fourth quarter earning call and our first quarter earning call, we talked about having to not only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements, but actually that wasn't going to be enough and that we were going to need to do more. And we are on track to doing more than our $1 billion. We also said that we needed to accelerate our restructuring. And in Cathie's prepared remarks, she said we are also on track to doing that, and that we needed to persist with our efforts to drive price stability in the market. So all of that is actually working out. Supplies trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had. Supplies inventory is now back within the ranges globally, and that's obviously where we want it to be. 
So we -- with all of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the installed base, we're focusing on high-value units. That's evidenced through the continued growth in value multifunction laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the product lineup. We did that 15 new devices launched last quarter, JetIntelligence, PageWide Array and OfficeJet Pro. And we said we needed to continue to grow in our graphics business and we did for the 11th consecutive quarter in a row as we did with Instant Ink. So as Cathie mentioned, all of that translates to what we're seeing transpire as we planned it out to be. And therefore, with all of that, we expect to stabilize our supplies revenue trajectory by the end of FY -- by the end of '17."

And I know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And your assertion that supplies should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me. And so if we look at last 5  quarters, hardware revenue has been down double digits. Hardware revenue has been down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the Four Box Model that says, what's happening to my installed base, it's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's the key thing that changes? Are you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more given their printers? But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your installed base, and that's declining. So I appreciate that your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think happens in the model to go from what's been closer to mid-single digit declines in supplies to 0 given the backdrop that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative."

Q3 is a relatively tough compare, because if you will remember last year, we did some incremental what we called insurance policy because of the split that we were going through. So it is a tough compare. But we went from minus 20% declines in Q1 to minus 16%, and then it's going to come down further as well in Q3 of '16. And I think what's important is that we've captured -- it's not like this is a surprise to us. We've captured it within the modeling that we have done. Our models are holding up and our models basically show that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

And there is no single magic pill that changes the supplies trajectory. So what we need to do is to continue to focus on all areas of the Four Box Model, the installed base being one metric. But remember that the installed base is a function of every kind of category and segment of business that we do, from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a lot of supplies. And we are placing more MPV-positive units enabled by the costs that we're taking out of the business. And we're innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market. Usage is another part of the Four Box Model. Not all printers are created equally. And even the same printer placed in a different location or a different ZIP code produce a different amount of supplies. So reshaping that installed base to higher-usage of printers is kind of job number one. 
The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach. And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing. And that sort of takes care of box number two. 
On the third box, the aftermarket share, you have these newer platforms that come with higher attach. You've got work we're doing around the omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering online coverage in marketing as well as the innovation that we're driving our ink formulas and new toner technology resulting in a much better printed page when you're using original HP supplies. 
And the fourth lever, of course, is pricing which remains flat and consistent with our expectations. So all these factors drive supplies consumption, not just the installed base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency."

So let me say that everything we've spoken about so far has really been focused on the core, and we're really incredibly focused on our traditional franchises of Print and Personal Systems. But as part of our overall strategy for the company, we do have certain growth areas that are incredibly important to us. You mentioned a couple of them. Our A3 product work remains on track, and our portfolio will come out towards the middle of next year. That is on time and on track and we're doing a lot of work around preparing, not only for the products, but for the go-to-market that is required in order to be successful in this marketplace. 
Another part of our growth engine is graphics. Graphics grew for the 11th consecutive quarter, and we're just about to walk into Drupa next week, which is the Olympics of the graphics business. It happens every 4 years and we're very excited about some of the products that we will be announcing at Drupa. 
And the third area is commercial mobility, and our commercial mobility practice continues to grow. We're excited by the work we're doing there. We made some really interesting category creating product announcements with the Elite x3 during the course of the quarter at Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. So lots of positive signals from the market from a product respective and the pipeline that we're building. 
And then, of course, only last week, we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation here, solving the problems of speed, quality and cost. We said we would release them in the second half of this year. And a proof point of that is the announcements that we made last week. And the strategic announcements that we made with Nike, with BMW, with Johnson & Johnson and Jabil, a very important player in this space. So I think there's a lot of markers out there that point to the execution of this team.

I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end customers and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough we've made towards really pulling 3D printing into the mainstream. We released the first production -- short run production 3D printing systems. They're 10x faster than other products that are out on the marketplace, unbelievable quality and most importantly, at half the cost. And when you get those 3 things right, you start to tap into specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in an analog fashion. And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the bill of materials of our 3D printers are printed by our 3D printers, so our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more economically advantageous to us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing. So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex, and I like complexity here, roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our Printing business. And we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with the brand that HP has and reputation that we have. So we're really excited by the market.

I think we were one of the earliest to predict that these markets will continue to be challenged for quite some time. And as a result of that, we needed to just take immediate action to get our costs in line with where the markets were. But over the long term, we sort of genuinely broadly agree with the analysts and where they expect things to land. We see continued declines in calendar quarter 2. The market is projecting that it will improve in calendar quarter 3 and 4, and we tend to disagree. Now whether it's low single digits or mid-single digits, I guess, that's up for debate and no one's is perfect at making those predictions. But I think things are getting better. 
To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves as we're able to fit more power into smaller platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the continuum all the way from mobile up to workstation. And these lines are beginning to blur and that enables us to create new products and new categories like Elite x3. That technology is not going to slow down. It's only going to accelerate. So I think we've got to start looking as an industry at the entire spectrum, all the way from phones to workstations. Think about that market. Think about how those hard lines were characterized in the past and how those hard lines will begin to break down in the future. And as leaders, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, whether that be the success we're having with our x2 or the new category trend in products like x3. It's all about changing that continuum. So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment, we segment again. We navigate the heat in the market and we predict where we think the heat's going to be. We're constantly challenging ourselves on price, function, value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system and we have to be a massive innovator, and I think we're doing all of that as well."

The fact that there was 6 points of currency, so you're down to -- down 10% constant currency, but you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction that, our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory on a go-forward basis.

And we -- obviously, as we go through '17, we expect that, that will continue to improve so that it stabilizes by the end of '17, but again, largely in line with what we expected. 
And then from a free cash flow perspective, a couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance was in the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days and we're now at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow. We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in many ways we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that it -- our free cash flow, on a year-to-date basis, also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously, are one -- more onetime in nature."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution.

I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution. We continue to be disciplined to delivering our core, gain momentum in our growth signals and hit strategic milestones in our future initiatives. 
Let me start with our overall performance in the third quarter. We achieved all of our financial objectives. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings per share of $0.48 above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered solid free cash flow of $1 billion as a result of strength in Personal Systems and a continued focus on working capital metrics. And we returned nearly $300 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As we move towards the end of our fiscal year, we are seeing the benefits of the significant productivity initiatives and restructuring actions we put in place at the start of this year. We are on track to implement more than $1 billion of savings, providing us opportunity to invest back into our businesses to drive long-term success. 
In Q3, our revenue trajectory improved, down less than 1% year-over-year at constant currency, driven by strength in Personal Systems, offset by expected declines in Printing. As we previously said, we believed overall revenue declines would moderate in the second half of the year. That is exactly what is happening. 
The PC market improved slightly more than forecasted, and we were well positioned with an innovative product lineup and healthy channel inventory level. We capitalized on market opportunities and gained share at the expense of our competitors, especially in the high-end premium category. 
The innovation in our portfolio is serving us well. We are building on a rich heritage and delivering experiences that amaze our customers and partners. Our products and solutions contain the magic that differentiate HP from the competition. This past quarter, our Printing and Personal Systems teams delivered awe-inspiring innovation. The Spectre 13 that we announced in April rolled out in countries around the world continues to elicit claim and praise, fueling our push into premium devices. 
Likewise, the platform is built for greatness or as those in the gaming world would like to say, domination. And new Omen laptops and desktops all launched to rave reviews and strong consumer demand based on their performance and engineering power. 
On the commercial go-to-market side, customers are increasingly shifting from transactional to contractual buying, wanting everything as a service. At the end of June, we unveiled our new PC-as-a-service business model that is gaining interest from companies around the world. Importantly, these premium gaming and service initiatives are all profit accretive. 
Moving to Printing highlights. HP's presence at drupa was unprecedented. Our graphics business sold a record 130 Indigo presses. Our large-format and digital printers including PageWide technology are accelerating the industry transformation from analog print to digital, opening new categories of packaging, print production and specialized ink innovation. 
During the quarter, we also unveiled the world's smallest all-in-one inkjet printer, helping to reinvent the printing experience for our mobile and socially-connected consumer. And earlier in May, we announced the world's first production-ready 3D Printing system. We continue to work with our ecosystem of manufacturers, codevelopment and strategic partners like Nike, BMW, Order Desk, Johnson & Johnson, Siemens and others and have now placed a number of demo units. Our partners are pleased and enthusiastically engaged in putting our technology to work printing sample parts for automotive, consumer goods, medical and other applications. 
Most recently, BMW announced plans to use 3D printing for their new Rolls-Royce Dawn. A materials partner announced plans for a series of custom powder materials on our open platform that will further 3D printing as a viable form of manufacturing for many businesses. 
Now turning to the segment specific performance. Personal Systems executed very well with revenue growth, share gains and improved profitability. We outperformed both the market and all key competitors in our core business while gaining momentum in our strategic growth segments including commercial mobility and services. 
Sequentially, Personal Systems revenue grew by 7.5%, better than normal seasonality. Our strong performance resulted in market share gains year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in all 3 regions. I've said many times, our focus is on profitable share gains. We gained 1.8 points of PC unit share year-over-year in calendar Q2 2016 while delivering significant operating profit improvement. 
Innovation, coupled with continued focus on cost management, was instrumental in driving these results. I'm especially pleased with our consumer business. The strength of our high-end premium and gaming portfolios supported improved gross margins both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
In commercial, we performed well but margins were pressured by an unfavorable mix shift to Chromebooks. In the quarter, we had outstanding wins with customers like Volvo, where we signed a 3-year devices and service contract to deliver Elite PCs and workshare stations together with care packs, factory services and priority support to more than 25,000 users across all regions. 
Shifting to Printing results. In line with our expectations, revenue declined year-over-year in the third quarter but with some improvement. Starting with hardware. We've made steady progress with unit sales down 10% year-over-year as compared to 20% in Q1 and 16% in Q2. 
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, hardware units grew 6%, well above normal seasonality. This supported sequential market share gains of 2 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware in calendar quarter 2. The market remained very challenging, and our progress was a direct result of discipline and operational rigor. We did what we said by both reducing discounts, as evidenced by year-over-year improvements in constant currency ASPs and improving our cost structure to enable a more positive NPV unit growth sequentially. 
Recall that not all printers are created equally. Our key objective is to place hardware units with a higher usage of supplies. As a proof point, for the 17th [ph] consecutive quarter, we gained share in the value multifunction laser printers, a strategic product segment, given the associated higher supplies usage. We're more challenged in our business ink products where we drove pricing discipline and lost some share. While our Japanese competitors are talking about shifting their focus from share to profits due to the strength of the yen, it is not broadly evident yet that this is showing up in less aggressive pricing. 
Turning to supplies. In Q3, we began to execute the sales model changes we discussed earlier this quarter. As we shared on our call on June 21, we made a strategic decision to evolve how we run and we manage our supplies business in recognition of the changing market dynamics, given global price transparency. The harmonized pricing, we determined an increase in marketing combined with the reduction in channel inventory levels was necessary and we took the first step in the third quarter. 
With continued support from our channel partners, the execution is on track. We will continue to implement operational changes to our supplies inventory management in the fourth quarter and will provide a further update on our Q4 earnings call. 
In Q3, we also continued to make progress in our shift from transactional to contractual sales. Managed Print Services revenue was up again year-over-year in constant currency. And on the consumer side, we saw a continued momentum in Instant Ink, our subscription-based supply service, with cumulative enrollee growth and load churn. 
Beyond home and office printing, graphics delivered another quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Following our success at drupa, we increased our HP Indigo manufacturing capabilities to fulfill orders, including 25 of the latest HP Indigo to support operations for the peak holiday season. 
Our PageWide web press platform will deliver high-quality and high-speed on-one [ph] press. Installations are scheduled to begin this fall. And in corrugated packaging, the PageWide TSeries deals signed at drupa are in installation phases around the world. 
Overall, we delivered on our financial commitments in the third quarter and I'm pleased with our progress. However, with the markets remaining challenging and somewhat volatile, we have more work to do. We will keep our eye on cost controls while continuing to focus on executing our strategy, protecting our core business through solid execution, delivering our growth initiatives and investing in category-creating opportunities for the future. And now, I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA and APJ continued to perform well. 
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by the unfavorable mix shift to Personal Systems and the reduction in supplies, largely due to the impact of the changes in the supply sales model, partially offset by gross margin expansion across Personal Systems. 
Not fully evident in the year-over-year compare is the steady progress the teams have made improving our cost structure. Gross margin was down 1.1 points quarter-over-quarter due primarily to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in Printing, partially offset by favorable product premium mix in Personal Systems. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.1 billion were down 25% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A as we recorded gains from the divestiture of the marketing optimization software asset. Recall that we leverage these latest gains to offset the impact of the reduced supplies into the channel related to the strategic sales model changes. 
We also achieved year-over-year savings via the previously communicated productivity improvements and restructuring actions. With a net expense of $55 million [ph] in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48. 
As compared to our previously provided outlook range, we recorded our higher gain from the divestiture as a result of closing more countries in Q3 than expected. The impact of the reduction in supplies revenue into the channel was in line with what we expected. The net of these amounted to about a $0.02 shift into Q3 from what we had forecasted for Q4. 
Non-GAAP net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $36 million, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $38 million and tax indemnification credits of $29 million. As we noted on the Q2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. On a GAAP basis, Q3 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49. 
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.5 billion, flat year-over-year and up 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was up 8% while commercial revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported. We outperformed the market overall as well as in the commercial and consumer markets while staying focused on gaining profitable share. We saw momentum in certain segments of the market, particularly in consumer and took advantage of the opportunities presented with innovative products, including the x360, Spectre 13 and the new Omen gaming portfolio. 
As a result of our continued focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial mobility, especially detachables and in services. 
Personal Systems ASPs were flat sequentially and down low single digits year-over-year. We continue to see a decline in commercial ASPs year-over-year, given the increased mix of Chromebooks. However, consumer ASPs improved both year-over-year and sequentially due to a strong premium mix. 
Personal Systems operating profit rate was 4.4%, up 1.6 points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion and tight expense management. Gross margin improvement was driven by cost reductions and premium mix, exceeding currency headwinds and competitive pricing. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. We made good progress particularly in hardware placements. Hardware units were down 10% year-over-year, significantly better than 16% last quarter as the cost actions we continue to implement increased the number of positive NPV units that could be placed. 
We attribute approximately 5 to 6 points of the year-over-year decline to the market, and the rest of the decline is split between less attractive units and channel inventory reductions in Q3 '16. In Q3, supplies revenue was down 18% year-over-year as reported or down 13% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Approximately 7 points of the constant-currency decline was associated with the planned reduction of supply sales into the channel, with the remainder being a combination of the separation-related channel inventory build in Q3 '15 and declines in our 4 box [ph] model drivers. While 4 box [ph] model drivers declined year-over-year, they performed in line with what we expected. 
Q3 supplies revenue mix was 64%, down approximately 3 points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the planned reduction of sales into the channel. Supplies channel inventory was down year-over-year and within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 20.4%, up 3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain from the software asset divestiture in excess of the expected supplies inventory reduction and marketing investments. Related to the divestiture announcement on June 20, we recorded a gain of $280 million in SG&A. This was greater than the estimate of $245 million provided on the June 21 supplies call due to the acceleration of the close into Q3. This will not have an EPS impact overall for the full fiscal year but will mean that Q4 will be lower by about $0.02 compared to what we guided in June. R&D for Printing was up both year-over-year and sequentially due to the ramp-up of investments to support A3 copiers and 3D Printing. 
Moving to an update on restructuring. Approximately 1,000 people exited the company in Q3 and approximately 2,300 year-to-date. The FY '15 [ph] restructuring activities are on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the fiscal year. 
We continue to seek efficiencies in our processes and will likely have more savings opportunities beyond 2016. The potential related actions will be announced at a later date once we have a plan in place. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.1 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1 billion. Cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, a 5-day sequential improvement, driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a 3-day increase in days of inventory. Days payable outstanding increased due primarily to Personal Systems, which had favorable linearity, volume and supplier mix. Days of inventory was up largely in line with normal seasonality. 
During our third fiscal quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares and paid $212 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $269 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly be within and potentially above our original 50% to 75% target range for returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for Q4. In Personal Systems, in line with the external analysts, we expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with incremental pressure in the commercial segment. 
In Printing, we expect to continue to make progress on our cost structure, giving us the opportunity to place more NPV positive units. As a result, we expect print revenue and hardware unit declines to continue to moderate year-over-year. Our execution of the change in the supplies sales model is expected to be in line with the $225 million reduction in revenue that we guided in June. We believe declines in supplies revenue in constant currency will continue but moderate. Supplies revenue is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
In Q4 and beyond, the uncertainty in the market caused by Brexit could create challenges, particularly in EMEA. A negative impact in gross domestic products could introduce risk to our revenue, particularly supplies, given the correlation we've seen in the past. We will continue to provide updates as things progress and more definitive information is available. 
As it relates to cash flow assumptions, in Q3, we started to note some issues with component supply availability in the Personal Systems market, given vendors shifting capacity to other product category. In Q4, we intend to opportunistically leverage the balance sheet for assurance of supply, which is expected to increase owned inventory and extend the cash conversion cycle by a few days. We also expect our capital expenditures to be greater in Q4 as compared to Q3. 
And lastly, we expect Printing revenues to be better sequentially as compared to lower quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in Personal Systems. On a GAAP-only basis, we assumed a settlement expense of approximately $200 million for a lump-sum offering [indiscernible] Q3 to certain terminated participants in the U.S. pension plan. 
With all that in mind, Q4 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Q4 '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.22 to $0.25. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.62. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.46 to $1.49. With that, let's open it up for questions."

Each quarter, it's a combination of obviously the -- what's going to be ultimately the demand for supplies, given the new model that we're working on and then also how many positive NPV units can we actually place. And so one of the things I'll call out, even though I have said that in the second half, I do think that the margins are going to be in that kind of 17% range for Printing, we are significantly, from Q3 to Q4, we are significantly increasing the amount of NPV positive units that we're placing. So that growth in units is well in excess of normal seasonality. And that does put pressure on kind of the bottom line. Certainly when you look at it sequentially, we're offsetting some of that with great cost improvement."

We're taking the cost out of the system so that we can effectively increase our total available market as we go after those NPV positive units. We are leveraging the strongest portfolio we've had in decades. We have real tangible differentiation in security embedded within the products. We have new business models like Instant Ink. And as those costs come out, you've seen over the course of the last 3 quarters the investment that we're making in units. In Q1, if you'll recall, we were down 20% in units. In Q2, we were down 16%. And in Q3, we were down 10% so a 6-point improvement quarter-over-quarter as those costs come out that we place units. To answer your second question around PC margins, I would say that our strategy has always been the same here. We're after profitable growth in this business. I think we run a very highly disciplined approach to profitable share expansion. It's about the number of things that's taking costs out. Costs always have to come out it's about segmenting the market. It's finding heat in the market today and anticipating whether heat is in the market in the future and scaling the park and innovating with sprinkles of magic that allow -- enable you to differentiate the product. So therefore, we choose where we want to play and where we don't want to play. And as a result of that, I think Ron in the team did just an outstanding job is quarter of executing to that strategy. And we yielded sort of the trifecta of growth in revenue, margin expansion and profitable share gain. And I think as a result of that, there's a range of somewhere between 3.5% to 5% that this business will deliver. But what's really important is as revenue declines abate, the negative cash conversion cycle of this business is very attractive."

I also think it is important that our view isn't that it's a linear path from whatever quarter you start out to stabilization. So it's not as if you're going to make progress every single quarter because of the lumpiness with which we place units and didn't place some units at the beginning of the year because there just weren't as many positive NPV units, we are going to see some lumpiness.

And they declined in -- sequentially in Q3, whereas the Personal Systems business is, in fact, not growing as quickly sequentially and below normal seasonality, and they've got the negative cash conversion cycle. So it's kind of a double whammy from a cash conversion cycle perspective and cash perspective in Q4. The way we think about the cash conversion cycle is that at the end of Q4, we will have a cash conversion cycle that is several days better than last year's negative 19 days but it will back up from Q3. We don't expect to have another quarter of minus 29 days, again because of this business mix impact and the fact that one of our businesses has a positive cash conversion cycle and it's growing, and the one with a negative cash conversion cycle is growing but not as rapidly as it did in Q3."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution.

I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution. We continue to be disciplined to delivering our core, gain momentum in our growth segments and hit strategic milestones in our future initiatives. 
Let me start with our overall performance in the third quarter. We achieved all of our financial objectives. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings per share of $0.48, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered solid free cash flow of $1 billion as a result of strength in Personal Systems and a continued focus on working capital metrics, and we returned nearly $300 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As we move towards the end of our fiscal year, we are seeing the benefits of the significant productivity initiatives and restructuring actions we put in place at the start of this year. We are on track to implement more than $1 billion of savings, providing us opportunity to invest back into our businesses to drive long-term success. 
In Q3, our revenue trajectory improved, down less than 1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength in Personal Systems, offset by expected declines in Printing. As we previously said, we believed overall revenue declines would moderate in the second half of the year, and that is exactly what is happening. 
The PC market improved slightly more than forecasted, and we were well positioned with an innovative product lineup and healthy channel inventory level. We capitalized on market opportunities and gained share at the expense of our competitors, especially in the high-end premium category. 
The innovation in our portfolio is serving us well. We are building on a rich heritage and delivering experiences that amaze our customers and partners. Our products and solutions contain the magic that differentiate HP from the competition. This past quarter, our Printing and Personal Systems teams delivered awe-inspiring innovation. 
The Spectre 13 that we announced in April rolled out in countries around the world continues to elicit acclaim and praise, fueling our push into premium devices. 
Likewise, the OMEN gaming platform is built for greatness or, as those in the gaming world would like to say, domination. And new OMEN laptops and desktops all launched to rave reviews and strong consumer demand based on their performance and engineering power. 
On the commercial go-to-market side, customers are increasingly shifting from transactional to contractual buying, wanting everything as a service. At the end of June, we unveiled our new PC-as-a-service business model that is gaining interest from companies around the world. 
Importantly, these premium gaming and service initiatives are all profit accretive. 
Moving to Printing highlights. HP's presence at drupa was unprecedented. Our graphics business sold a record 130 Indigo presses. Our large-format and digital printers, including PageWide technology, are accelerating the industry transformation from analog print to digital, opening new categories of packaging, print production and specialized ink innovation. 
During the quarter, we also unveiled the world's smallest all-in-one inkjet printer, helping to reinvent the printing experience for our mobile and socially-connected consumer. And earlier in May, we announced the world's first production-ready 3D printing system. We continue to work with our ecosystem of manufacturers, co-development and strategic partners like Nike, BMW, Order Desk, Jabil, Johnson & Johnson, Shapeways, Siemens and others, and have now placed a number of demo units. Our partners are pleased and enthusiastically engaged in putting our technology to work printing sample parts for automotive, consumer goods, medical and other applications. 
Most recently, BMW announced plans to use 3D printing for their new Rolls-Royce Dawn. Our materials partner, Evonik, announced plans for a series of custom powder materials on our open platform that will further 3D printing as a viable form of manufacturing for many businesses. 
Now turning to the segments' specific performance. Personal Systems executed very well with revenue growth, share gains and improved profitability. We outperformed both the market and all key competitors in our core business while gaining momentum in our strategic growth segments including commercial mobility and services. Sequentially, Personal Systems revenue grew by 7.5%, better than normal seasonality. 
Our strong performance resulted in market share gains year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in all 3 regions. I've said many times, our focus is on profitable share gains. We gained 1.8 points of PC unit share year-over-year in calendar Q2 2016 while delivering significant operating profit improvement. Innovation, coupled with continued focus on cost management, was instrumental in driving these results. 
I'm especially pleased with our consumer business. The strength of our high-end premium and gaming portfolios supported improved gross margins both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
In commercial, we performed well, but margins were pressured by an unfavorable mix shift to Chromebooks. In the quarter, we had outstanding wins with customers like Volvo, where we signed a 3-year device as a service contract to deliver elite PCs and workstations together with care packs, factory services and priority support to more than 25,000 users across all regions. 
Shifting to Printing results. In line with our expectations, revenue declined year-over-year in the third quarter but with some improvement. 
Starting with hardware. We have made steady progress with unit sales down 10% year-over-year as compared to 20% in Q1 and 16% in Q2. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, hardware units grew 6%, well above normal seasonality. This supported sequential market share gains of 2 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware in calendar quarter 2. The market remained very challenging, and our progress was a direct result of discipline and operational rigor. We did what we said by both reducing discounts, as evidenced by year-over-year improvements in constant currency ASPs and improving our cost structure to enable a more positive NPV unit growth sequentially. 
Recall that not all printers are created equally. Our key objective is to place hardware units with a higher usage of supplies. As a proof point, for the 17th consecutive quarter, we gained share in the value multifunction laser printers, a strategic product segment, given the associated higher supplies usage. We are more challenged in our business ink products, where we drove pricing discipline and lost some share. While our Japanese competitors are talking about shifting their focus from share to profits due to the strength of the yen, it is not broadly evident yet that this is showing up in less aggressive pricing. 
Turning to supplies. In Q3, we began to execute the sales model changes we discussed earlier this quarter. As we shared on our call on June 21, we made a strategic decision to evolve how we run and manage our supplies business in recognition of the changing market dynamics, given global price transparency. To harmonized pricing, we determined an increase in marketing combined with the reduction in channel inventory levels was necessary, and we took the first step in the third quarter. With continued support from our channel partners, the execution is on track. We will continue to implement operational changes to our supplies inventory management in the fourth quarter and will provide a further update on our Q4 earnings call. 
In Q3, we also continued to make progress in our shift from transactional to contractual sales. Managed Print Services revenue was up again year-over-year in constant currency. And on the consumer side, we saw a continued momentum in Instant Ink, our subscription-based supply service, with cumulative enrollee growth and load churn. 
Beyond home and office printing, graphics delivered another quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Following our success at drupa, we increased our HP Indigo manufacturing capabilities to fulfill orders, including 25 of the latest HP Indigo presses for Shutterfly to support operations for the peak holiday season. Our PageWide web press platform will deliver high-quality and high-speed on one press. Installations are scheduled to begin this fall. And in corrugated packaging, the PageWide T-Series deals signed at drupa are in installation phases around the world. 
Overall, we delivered on our financial commitments in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our progress. However, with the markets remaining challenging and somewhat volatile, we have more work to do. We will keep our eye on cost controls while continuing to focus on executing our strategy, protecting our core business through solid execution, delivering our growth initiatives and investing in category-creating opportunities for the future. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

Q3 results were largely in line with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA, and APJ continued to perform well. 
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by the unfavorable mix shift to Personal Systems and the reduction in supplies, largely due to the impact of the changes in the supplies sales model, partially offset by gross margin expansion across Personal Systems. 
Not fully evident in the year-over-year compare is the steady progress the teams have made improving our cost structure. Gross margin was down 1.1 points quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in Printing, partially offset by favorable product premium mix in Personal Systems. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.1 billion were down 25% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A as we recorded gains from the divestiture of the marketing optimization software asset. Recall that we leverage these latest gains to offset the impact of the reduced supplies into the channel related to the strategic sales model changes. We also achieved year-over-year savings via the previously communicated productivity improvements and restructuring actions. 
With a net expense of $55 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48. 
As compared to our previously provided outlook range, we recorded our higher gain from the divestiture as a result of closing more countries in Q3 than expected. The impact of the reduction in supplies revenue into the channel was in line with what we expected. The net of these amounted to about a $0.02 shift into Q3 from what we had forecasted for Q4. 
Non-GAAP net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $36 million, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $38 million and tax indemnification credits of $29 million. As we noted on the Q2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. On a GAAP basis, Q3 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49. 
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.5 billion, flat year-over-year and up 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was up 8%, while commercial revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported. We outperformed the market overall as well as in the commercial and consumer markets while staying focused on gaining profitable share. We saw a momentum in certain segments of the market, particularly in consumer, and took advantage of the opportunities presented with innovative products, including the x360, Spectre 13 and the new OMEN gaming portfolio. 
As a result of our continued focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial mobility, especially detachables, and in services. 
Personal Systems ASPs were flat sequentially and down low single digits year-over-year. We continue to see a decline in commercial ASPs year-over-year, given the increased mix of Chromebooks. However, consumer ASPs improved both year-over-year and sequentially due to a strong premium mix. 
Personal Systems operating profit rate was 4.4%, up 1.6 points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion and tight expense management. Gross margin improvement was driven by cost reductions and premium mix, exceeding currency headwinds and competitive pricing. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. We made good progress, particularly in hardware placements. Hardware units were down 10% year-over-year, significantly better than 16% last quarter as the cost actions we continue to implement increased the number of positive NPV units that could be placed. We attribute approximately 5 to 6 points of the year-over-year decline to the market, and the rest of the decline is split between less attractive units and channel inventory reductions in Q3 '16. 
In Q3, supplies revenue was down 18% year-over-year as reported or down 13% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Approximately 7 points of the constant currency decline was associated with the planned reduction of supplies sales into the channel, with the remainder being a combination of the separation-related channel inventory build in Q3 '15 and declines in our Four Box Model drivers. While Four Box Model drivers declined year-over-year, they performed in line with what we expected. 
Q3 supplies revenue mix was 64%, down approximately 3 points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the planned reduction of sales into the channel. Supplies channel inventory was down year-over-year and within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 20.4%, up 3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain from the software asset divestiture in excess of the expected supplies channel inventory reduction and marketing investments. 
Related to the divestiture announcement on June 20, we recorded a gain of $280 million in SG&A. This was greater than the estimate of $245 million provided on the June 21 supplies call due to the acceleration of the close into Q3. This will not have an EPS impact overall for the full fiscal year but will mean that Q4 will be lower by about $0.02 compared to what we guided in June. 
R&D for Printing was up both year-over-year and sequentially due to the ramp-up of investments to support A3 copiers and 3D printing. 
Moving to an update on restructuring. Approximately 1,000 people exited the company in Q3 and approximately 2,300 year-to-date. The FY '16 restructuring activities are on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to seek efficiencies in our processes and will likely have more savings opportunities beyond 2016. The potential-related actions will be announced at a later date once we have a plan in place. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $1 billion. Cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, a 5-day sequential improvement, driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a 3-day increase in days of inventory. Days payable outstanding increased due primarily to Personal Systems, which had favorable linearity, volume and supplier mix. Days of inventory was up largely, in line with normal seasonality. 
During our third fiscal quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares and paid $212 million in dividend for a total capital return to shareholders of $269 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly be within and potentially above our original 50% to 75% target range for returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for Q4. In Personal Systems, in line with the external analysts, we expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with incremental pressure in the commercial segment. 
In Printing, we expect to continue to make progress on our cost structure, giving us the opportunity to place more NPV positive units. As a result, we expect print revenue and hardware unit declines to continue to moderate year-over-year. 
Our execution of the change in the supplies sales model is expected to be in line with the $225 million reduction in revenue that we guided in June. We believe declines in supplies revenue in constant currency will continue but moderate. Supplies revenue is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
In Q4 and beyond, the uncertainty in the market caused by Brexit could create challenges, particularly in EMEA. A negative impact in gross domestic product could introduce risk to our revenue, particularly supplies, given the correlation we've seen in the past. We will continue to provide updates as things progress and more definitive information is available. 
As it relates to cash flow assumptions, in Q3, we started to note some issues with component supply availability in the Personal Systems market, given vendors shifting capacity to other product category. In Q4, we intend to opportunistically leverage the balance sheet for assurance of supply, which is expected to increase owned inventory and extend the cash conversion cycle by a few days. We also expect our capital expenditures to be greater in Q4 as compared to Q3. And lastly, we expect Printing revenues to be better sequentially as compared to lower quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in Personal Systems. 
On a GAAP-only basis, we assumed a settlement expense of approximately $200 million for a lump-sum offering we made during Q3 to certain terminated vested participants in the U.S. pension plan. 
With all that in mind, Q4 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Q4 '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.22 to $0.25. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.62. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.46 to $1.49. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Each quarter, it's a combination of obviously the -- what's going to be ultimately the demand for supplies, given the new model that we're working on, and then also how many positive NPV units can we actually place. And so one of the things I'll call out even though I have said that in the second half, I do think that the margins are going to be kind of in that 17% range for Printing, we are significantly, from Q3 to Q4, we are significantly increasing the amount of NPV positive units that we're placing. So that growth in units is well in excess of the normal seasonality. And that does put pressure on kind of the bottom line.

We're taking the cost out of the system so that we can effectively increase our total available market as we go after those NPV positive units. We are leveraging the strongest portfolio we've had in decades. We have real tangible differentiation in security embedded within the products. We have new business models like Instant Ink. And as those costs come out, you've seen over the course of the last 3 quarters the investment that we're making in units. In Q1, if you'll recall, we were down 20% in units. In Q2, we were down 16%. And in Q3, we were down 10%. So a 6-point improvement quarter-over-quarter as those cost come out that we place for units. To answer your second question around PC margins, I would say that our strategy has always been the same here. We're after profitable growth in this business. I think we run a very highly disciplined approach to profitable share expansion. It's about a number of things that's taking costs out. Costs always have to come out. It's about segmenting the market. It's finding heat in the market today, anticipating where the heat is in the market in the future and scaling the park and innovating with sprinkles of magic that allow -- enable you to differentiate the product. And so therefore, we choose where we want to play and where we don't want to play. And as a result of that, I think Ron and the team did just an outstanding job this quarter of executing to that strategy. And we yielded sort of the trifecta of growth in revenue, margin expansion and profitable share gain. And I think as a result of that, there's a range of somewhere between 3.5% to 5% that this business will deliver. But what's really important is as revenue declines abate, the negative cash conversion cycle of this business is very attractive."

So on a pure apples-to-apples basis, what's making all of the same adjustments, currency, supply -- what we call the supplies push-pull or the change in the supplies model and the build in Q3 of '15, which was very significant because of the separation, the model in Q3 says we're down roughly 3% to 4%, which is roughly in line with what we saw last quarter. I also think it is important that our view isn't that it's a linear path from whatever quarter you start out to stabilization. So it's not as if you're going to make progress every single quarter because of the lumpiness with which we place units and didn't place some units at the beginning of the year because there just weren't as many positive NPV units, we are going to see some lumpiness. What's really important is that our Four Box Model is predicting each quarter what we had -- what the results would be and doing it fairly accurately. And so we believe that this model is a good predictor of the future.

I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution. We continue to be disciplined to deliver in our core, gain momentum in our growth segments and hit strategic milestones in our future initiatives. 
Let me start with our overall performance in the third quarter. We achieved all of our financial objectives. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings per share of $0.48, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered solid free cash flow of $1 billion as a result of strength in Personal Systems and a continued focus on working capital metrics, and we returned nearly $300 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As we move towards the end of our fiscal year, we are seeing the benefits of the significant productivity initiatives and restructuring actions we put in place at the start of this year. We are on track to implement more than $1 billion of savings, providing us opportunity to invest back into our businesses to drive long-term success. 
In Q3, our revenue trajectory improved, down less than 1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength in Personal Systems, offset by expected declines in Printing. As we previously said, we believed overall revenue declines would moderate in the second half of the year, and that is exactly what is happening. 
The PC market improved slightly more than forecasted, and we were well positioned with an innovative product lineup and healthy channel inventory level. We capitalized on market opportunities and gained share at the expense of our competitors, especially in the high-end premium category. 
The innovation in our portfolio is serving us well. We are building on a rich heritage and delivering experiences that amaze our customers and partners. Our products and solutions contain the magic that differentiate HP from the competition. This past quarter, our Printing and Personal Systems teams delivered awe-inspiring innovation. 
The Spectre 13 that we announced in April rolled out in countries around the world continues to elicit acclaim and praise, fueling our push into premium devices. 
Likewise, the OMEN gaming platform is built for greatness or, as those in the gaming world would like to say, domination. And new OMEN laptops and desktops all launched to rave reviews and strong consumer demand based on their performance and engineering power. 
On the commercial go-to-market side, customers are increasingly shifting from transactional to contractual buying, wanting everything as a service. At the end of June, we unveiled our new PC-as-a-service business model that is gaining interest from companies around the world. 
Importantly, these premium gaming and service initiatives are all profit accretive. 
Moving to Printing highlights. HP's presence at drupa was unprecedented. Our graphics business sold a record 130 Indigo presses. Our large-format and digital printers, including PageWide technology, are accelerating the industry transformation from analog print to digital, opening new categories of packaging, print production and specialized ink innovation. 
During the quarter, we also unveiled the world's smallest all-in-one inkjet printer, helping to reinvent the printing experience for a mobile and socially-connected consumer. And earlier in May, we announced the world's first production-ready 3D printing system. We continue to work with our ecosystem of manufacturers, co-development and strategic partners like Nike, BMW, Order Desk, Jabil, Johnson & Johnson, Shapeways, Siemens and others, and have now placed a number of demo units. Our partners are pleased and enthusiastically engaged in putting our technology to work printing sample parts for automotive, consumer goods, medical and other applications. 
Most recently, BMW announced plans to use 3D printing for their new Rolls-Royce Dawn. And materials partner, Evonik, announced plans for a series of custom powder materials on our open platform that will further 3D printing as a viable form of manufacturing for many businesses. 
Now turning to the segments' specific performance. Personal Systems executed very well with revenue growth, share gains and improved profitability. We outperformed both the market and all key competitors in our core business while gaining momentum in our strategic growth segments including Commercial Mobility and Services. Sequentially, Personal Systems revenue grew by 7.5%, better than normal seasonality. 
Our strong performance resulted in market share gains year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in all 3 regions. I've said many times, our focus is on profitable share gains. We gained 1.8 points of PC unit share year-over-year in calendar Q2 2016 while delivering significant operating profit improvement. Innovation, coupled with continued focus on cost management, was instrumental in driving these results. 
I'm especially pleased with our Consumer business. The strength of our high-end premium and gaming portfolios supported improved gross margins both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
In Commercial, we performed well, but margins were pressured by an unfavorable mix shift to Chromebooks. In the quarter, we had outstanding wins with customers like Volvo, where we signed a 3-year device as a service contract to deliver elite PCs and workstations together with care packs, factory services and priority support to more than 25,000 users across all regions. 
Shifting to Printing results. In line with our expectations, revenue declined year-over-year in the third quarter but with some improvement. 
Starting with hardware. We have made steady progress with unit sales down 10% year-over-year as compared to 20% in Q1 and 16% in Q2. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, hardware units grew 6%, well above normal seasonality. This supported sequential market share gains of 2 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware in calendar quarter 2. The market remained very challenging, and our progress was a direct result of discipline and operational rigor. We did what we said by both reducing discounts, as evidenced by year-over-year improvements in constant currency ASPs and improving our cost structure to enable a more positive NPV unit growth sequentially. 
Recall that not all printers are created equally. Our key objective is to place hardware units with a higher usage of supplies. As a proof point, for the 17th consecutive quarter, we gained share in the value multifunction laser printers, a strategic product segment, given the associated higher supplies usage. We are more challenged in our business ink products, where we drove pricing discipline and lost some share. While our Japanese competitors are talking about shifting their focus from share to profits due to the strength of the yen, it is not broadly evident yet that this is showing up in less aggressive pricing. 
Turning to supplies. In Q3, we began to execute the sales model changes we discussed earlier this quarter. As we shared on our call on June 21, we made a strategic decision to evolve how we run and manage our supplies business in recognition of the changing market dynamics, given global price transparency. To harmonize pricing, we determined an increase in marketing combined with a reduction in channel inventory levels was necessary, and we took the first step in the third quarter. With continued support from our channel partners, the execution is on track. We will continue to implement operational changes to our supplies inventory management in the fourth quarter and will provide a further update on our Q4 earnings call. 
In Q3, we also continued to make progress in our shift from transactional to contractual sales. Managed Print Services revenue was up again year-over-year in constant currency. And on the consumer side, we saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, our subscription-based supply service, with cumulative enrollee growth and low churn. 
Beyond home and office printing, graphics delivered another quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Following our success at drupa, we increased our HP Indigo manufacturing capabilities to fulfill orders, including 25 of the latest HP Indigo presses for Shutterfly to support operations for the peak holiday season. Our PageWide web press platform will deliver high-quality and high-speed on one press. Installations are scheduled to begin this fall. And in corrugated packaging, the PageWide T-Series deals signed at drupa are in installation phases around the world. 
Overall, we delivered on our financial commitments in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our progress. However, with the markets remaining challenging and somewhat volatile, we have more work to do. We will keep our eye on cost controls while continuing to focus on executing our strategy, protecting our core business through solid execution, delivering our growth initiatives and investing in category-creating opportunities for the future. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

Q3 results were largely in line with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA, and APJ continued to perform well. 
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by the unfavorable mix shift to Personal Systems and the reduction in supplies, largely due to the impact of the changes in the supplies sales model, partially offset by gross margin expansion across Personal Systems. 
Not fully evident in the year-over-year compare is the steady progress the teams have made improving our cost structure. Gross margin was down 1.1 points quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in Printing, partially offset by favorable product premium mix in Personal Systems. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.1 billion were down 25% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A as we recorded gains from the divestiture of the marketing optimization software assets. Recall that we leverage these latest gains to offset the impact of the reduced supplies into the channel related to the strategic sales model changes. We also achieved year-over-year savings via the previously communicated productivity improvements and restructuring actions. 
With a net expense of $55 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48. 
As compared to our previously provided outlook range, we recorded a higher gain from the divestiture as a result of closing more countries in Q3 than expected. The impact of the reduction in supplies revenue into the channel was in line with what we expected. The net of these amounted to about a $0.02 shift into Q3 from what we had forecasted for Q4. 
Non-GAAP net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $36 million, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $38 million and tax indemnification credits of $29 million. As we noted on the Q2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. On a GAAP basis, Q3 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49. 
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.5 billion, flat year-over-year and up 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was up 8%, while commercial revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported. We outperformed the market overall as well as in the commercial and consumer markets while staying focused on gaining profitable share. We saw momentum in certain segments of the market, particularly in consumer, and took advantage of the opportunities presented with innovative products, including the x360, Spectre 13 and the new OMEN gaming portfolio. 
As a result of our continued focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in Commercial Mobility, especially detachables, and in Services. 
Personal Systems ASPs were flat sequentially and down low single digits year-over-year. We continued to see a decline in commercial ASPs year-over-year, given the increased mix of Chromebooks. However, consumer ASPs improved both year-over-year and sequentially due to a strong premium mix. 
Personal Systems operating profit rate was 4.4%, up 1.6 points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion and tight expense management. Gross margin improvement was driven by cost reductions and premium mix, exceeding currency headwinds and competitive pricing. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. We made good progress, particularly in hardware placements. Hardware units were down 10% year-over-year, significantly better than 16% last quarter as the cost actions we continue to implement increased the number of positive NPV units that could be placed. We attribute approximately 5 to 6 points of the year-over-year decline to the market, and the rest of the decline is split between less attractive units and channel inventory reductions in Q3 '16. 
In Q3, supplies revenue was down 18% year-over-year as reported or down 13% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Approximately 7 points of the constant currency decline was associated with the planned reduction of supplies sales into the channel, with the remainder being a combination of the separation-related channel inventory build in Q3 '15 and declines in our Four Box Model drivers. While Four Box Model drivers declined year-over-year, they performed in line with what we expected. 
Q3 supplies revenue mix was 64%, down approximately 3 points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the planned reduction of sales into the channel. Supplies channel inventory was down year-over-year and within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 20.4%, up 3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain from the software asset divestiture in excess of the expected supplies channel inventory reduction and marketing investments. 
Related to the divestiture announcement on June 20, we recorded a gain of $280 million in SG&A. This was greater than the estimate of $245 million provided on the June 21 supplies call due to the acceleration of the close into Q3. This will not have an EPS impact overall for the full fiscal year but will mean that Q4 will be lower by about $0.02 compared to what we guided in June. 
R&D for Printing was up both year-over-year and sequentially due to the ramp-up of investments to support A3 copiers and 3D printing. 
Moving to an update on restructuring. Approximately 1,000 people exited the company in Q3 and approximately 2,300 year-to-date. The FY '16 restructuring activities are on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to seek efficiencies in our processes and will likely have more savings opportunities beyond 2016. The potential related actions will be announced at a later date, once we have a plan in place. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $1 billion. Cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, a 5-day sequential improvement, driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a 3-day increase in days of inventory. Days payable outstanding increased due primarily to Personal Systems, which had favorable linearity, volume and supplier mix. Days of inventory was up largely in line with normal seasonality. 
During our third fiscal quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares and paid $212 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $269 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly be within and potentially above our original 50% to 75% target range for returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for Q4. In Personal Systems, in line with the external analysts, we expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with incremental pressure in the Commercial segment. 
In Printing, we expect to continue to make progress on our cost structure, giving us the opportunity to place more NPV-positive units. As a result, we expect print revenue and hardware unit declines to continue to moderate year-over-year. 
Our execution of the change in the supplies sales model is expected to be in line with the $225 million reduction in revenue that we guided in June. We believe declines in supplies revenue in constant currency will continue but moderate. Supplies revenue is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
In Q4 and beyond, the uncertainty in the market caused by Brexit could create challenges, particularly in EMEA. A negative impact in gross domestic product could introduce risk to our revenue, particularly supplies, given the correlation we've seen in the past. We will continue to provide updates as things progress and more definitive information is available. 
As it relates to cash flow assumptions, in Q3, we started to note some issues with component supply availability in the Personal Systems market, given vendors shifting capacity to other product category. In Q4, we intend to opportunistically leverage the balance sheet for assurance of supply, which is expected to increase owned inventory and extend the cash conversion cycle by a few days. We also expect our capital expenditures to be greater in Q4 as compared to Q3. And lastly, we expect Printing revenue to be better sequentially as compared to lower quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in Personal Systems. 
On a GAAP-only basis, we assumed a settlement expense of approximately $200 million for a lump-sum offering we made during Q3 to certain terminated vested participants in the U.S. pension plan. 
With all that in mind, Q4 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Q4 '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.22 to $0.25. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.62. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.46 to $1.49. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so one of the things I'll call out -- even though I have said that in the second half I do think that the margins are going to be kind of in that 17% range for Printing. We are significantly, from Q3 to Q4, we are significantly increasing the amount of NPV positive units that we're placing. So that growth in units is well in excess of normal seasonality, and that does put pressure on kind of the bottom line. Certainly when you look at it sequentially, we're offsetting some of that with great cost improvement."

We're taking the cost out of the system so that we can effectively increase our total available market as we go after those NPV positive units. We are leveraging the strongest portfolio we've had in decades. We have real tangible differentiation in security embedded within the products. We have new business models like Instant Ink. And as those costs come out, you've seen over the course of the last 3 quarters the investment that we're making in units. In Q1, if you'll recall, we were down 20% in units. In Q2, we were down 16%. And in Q3, we were down 10%. So a 6-point improvement quarter-over-quarter as those costs come out that we place for units. To answer your second question around PC margins, I would say that our strategy has always been the same here. We're after profitable growth in this business. I think we run a very highly disciplined approach to profitable share expansion. It's about a number of things. It's taking costs out. Costs always have to come out. It's about segmenting the market. It's finding heat in the market today, anticipating where the heat is in the market in the future and skating to the puck and innovating with sprinkles of magic that allow -- enable you to differentiate the product. And so therefore, we choose where we want to play and where we don't want to play. And as a result of that, I think Ron and the team did just an outstanding job this quarter of executing to that strategy. And we yielded sort of the trifecta of growth in revenue, margin expansion and profitable share gain. And I think as a result of that, there's a range of somewhere between 3.5% to 5% that this business will deliver. But what's really important is as revenue declines abate, the negative cash conversion cycle of this business is very attractive."

So let's start with the very first one around the channel inventory levels. We were within our target levels exiting Q3, and we did the roughly $225 million worth of channel reduction that we told you we would do with the new sales model for supplies. In terms of if we do another $225 million, will we be below our ranges? We will still be within our ranges but obviously at a much lower level within our ranges. The ranges are not dynamic in the sense of we change them every quarter, kind of at the beginning of the quarter. We set our ranges at the beginning of the year. Now there's some different seasonality quarter-to-quarter, and so the ranges can flux a little bit from quarter-to-quarter depending on seasonality. And you see that in Q4 because you've got more holiday, back-to-school type stuff going on. But we should be -- we'll be in very good position when we take another $225 million out of the channel.

And I appreciate there may have been some channel build in last Q3 but I think there was in Q2 as well. The growth rates were very, very comparable. And so at least, optically, it doesn't feel like the supplies growth rate on a sell-through basis is getting better. At the margin, it actually looks like it's getting worse.

But last quarter, when we were at about negative 3%, it was adjusting for all of the channel inventory adjustments in the previous year as well as that current quarter. So on a pure apples-to-apples basis, with making all of the same adjustments, currency -- what we call the supplies push-pull or the change in the supplies model and the build in Q3 of '15, which was very significant because of the separation, the model in Q3 says we're down roughly 3% to 4%, which is roughly in line with what we saw last quarter. I also think it is important that our view isn't that it's a linear path from whatever quarter you start out to stabilization. So it's not as if you're going to make progress every single quarter because of the lumpiness with which we place units and didn't place some units at the beginning of the year because there just weren't as many positive NPV units, we are going to see some lumpiness. What's really important is that our Four Box Model is predicting each quarter what we had -- what the results would be and doing it fairly accurately. And so we believe that this model is a good predictor of the future. And it's that model that is ultimately driving our view that there's stabilization in constant currency in supplies revenue by the end of '17."

But in Q4, again, one of the biggest dynamics in Q4, and I can go through all the different puts and takes, but probably the biggest dynamic in Q4 is the fact that the Printing business that has a positive cash conversion cycle is growing sequentially better than normal seasonality. And they declined in -- sequentially in Q3, whereas the Personal Systems business is, in fact, not growing as quickly sequentially and below normal seasonality, and they've got the negative cash conversion cycle. And so it's kind of a double whammy from a cash conversion cycle perspective and cash perspective in Q4. The way we think about the cash conversion cycle is that at the end of Q4, we will have a cash conversion cycle that is several days better than last year's negative 19 days but it will back up from Q3. We don't expect to have another quarter of minus 29 days, again because of this business mix impact and the fact that one of our businesses has a positive cash conversion cycle and is growing.

I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution. We continue to be disciplined to deliver in our core, gain momentum in our growth segments and hit strategic milestones in our future initiatives. 
Let me start with our overall performance in the third quarter. We achieved all of our financial objectives. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings per share of $0.48, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered solid free cash flow of $1 billion as a result of strength in Personal Systems and a continued focus on working capital metrics, and we returned nearly $300 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As we move towards the end of our fiscal year, we are seeing the benefits of the significant productivity initiatives and restructuring actions we put in place at the start of this year. We are on track to implement more than $1 billion of savings, providing us opportunity to invest back into our businesses to drive long-term success. 
In Q3, our revenue trajectory improved, down less than 1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength in Personal Systems, offset by expected declines in Printing. As we previously said, we believed overall revenue declines would moderate in the second half of the year, and that is exactly what is happening. 
The PC market improved slightly more than forecasted, and we were well positioned with an innovative product lineup and healthy channel inventory level. We capitalized on market opportunities and gained share at the expense of our competitors, especially in the high-end premium category. 
The innovation in our portfolio is serving us well. We are building on a rich heritage and delivering experiences that amaze our customers and partners. Our products and solutions contain the magic that differentiate HP from the competition. This past quarter, our Printing and Personal Systems teams delivered awe-inspiring innovation. 
The Spectre 13 that we announced in April rolled out in countries around the world continues to elicit acclaim and praise, fueling our push into premium devices. 
Likewise, the OMEN gaming platform is built for greatness or, as those in the gaming world would like to say, domination. And new OMEN laptops and desktops all launched to rave reviews and strong consumer demand based on their performance and engineering power. 
On the commercial go-to-market side, customers are increasingly shifting from transactional to contractual buying, wanting everything as a service. At the end of June, we unveiled our new PC-as-a-service business model that is gaining interest from companies around the world. 
Importantly, these premium gaming and service initiatives are all profit accretive. 
Moving to Printing highlights. HP's presence at drupa was unprecedented. Our graphics business sold a record 130 Indigo presses. Our large-format and digital printers, including PageWide technology, are accelerating the industry transformation from analog print to digital, opening new categories of packaging, print production and specialized ink innovation. 
During the quarter, we also unveiled the world's smallest all-in-one inkjet printer, helping to reinvent the printing experience for a mobile and socially-connected consumer. And earlier in May, we announced the world's first production-ready 3D printing system. We continue to work with our ecosystem of manufacturers, co-development and strategic partners like Nike, BMW, Order Desk, Jabil, Johnson & Johnson, Shapeways, Siemens and others, and have now placed a number of demo units. Our partners are pleased and enthusiastically engaged in putting our technology to work printing sample parts for automotive, consumer goods, medical and other applications. 
Most recently, BMW announced plans to use 3D printing for their new Rolls-Royce Dawn. And materials partner, Evonik, announced plans for a series of custom powder materials on our open platform that will further 3D printing as a viable form of manufacturing for many businesses. 
Now turning to the segments' specific performance. Personal Systems executed very well with revenue growth, share gains and improved profitability. We outperformed both the market and all key competitors in our core business while gaining momentum in our strategic growth segments including Commercial Mobility and Services. Sequentially, Personal Systems revenue grew by 7.5%, better than normal seasonality. 
Our strong performance resulted in market share gains year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in all 3 regions. I've said many times, our focus is on profitable share gains. We gained 1.8 points of PC unit share year-over-year in calendar Q2 2016 while delivering significant operating profit improvement. Innovation, coupled with continued focus on cost management, was instrumental in driving these results. 
I'm especially pleased with our Consumer business. The strength of our high-end premium and gaming portfolios supported improved gross margins both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
In Commercial, we performed well, but margins were pressured by an unfavorable mix shift to Chromebooks. In the quarter, we had outstanding wins with customers like Volvo, where we signed a 3-year device as a service contract to deliver elite PCs and workstations together with care packs, factory services and priority support to more than 25,000 users across all regions. 
Shifting to Printing results. In line with our expectations, revenue declined year-over-year in the third quarter but with some improvement. 
Starting with hardware. We have made steady progress with unit sales down 10% year-over-year as compared to 20% in Q1 and 16% in Q2. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, hardware units grew 6%, well above normal seasonality. This supported sequential market share gains of 2 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware in calendar quarter 2. The market remained very challenging, and our progress was a direct result of discipline and operational rigor. We did what we said by both reducing discounts, as evidenced by year-over-year improvements in constant currency ASPs and improving our cost structure to enable a more positive NPV unit growth sequentially. 
Recall that not all printers are created equally. Our key objective is to place hardware units with a higher usage of supplies. As a proof point, for the 17th consecutive quarter, we gained share in the value multifunction laser printers, a strategic product segment, given the associated higher supplies usage. We are more challenged in our business ink products, where we drove pricing discipline and lost some share. While our Japanese competitors are talking about shifting their focus from share to profits due to the strength of the yen, it is not broadly evident yet that this is showing up in less aggressive pricing. 
Turning to supplies. In Q3, we began to execute the sales model changes we discussed earlier this quarter. As we shared on our call on June 21, we made a strategic decision to evolve how we run and manage our supplies business in recognition of the changing market dynamics, given global price transparency. To harmonize pricing, we determined an increase in marketing combined with a reduction in channel inventory levels was necessary, and we took the first step in the third quarter. With continued support from our channel partners, the execution is on track. We will continue to implement operational changes to our supplies inventory management in the fourth quarter and will provide a further update on our Q4 earnings call. 
In Q3, we also continued to make progress in our shift from transactional to contractual sales. Managed Print Services revenue was up again year-over-year in constant currency. And on the consumer side, we saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, our subscription-based supply service, with cumulative enrollee growth and low churn. 
Beyond home and office printing, graphics delivered another quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Following our success at drupa, we increased our HP Indigo manufacturing capabilities to fulfill orders, including 25 of the latest HP Indigo presses for Shutterfly to support operations for the peak holiday season. Our PageWide web press platform will deliver high-quality and high-speed on one press. Installations are scheduled to begin this fall. And in corrugated packaging, the PageWide T-Series deals signed at drupa are in installation phases around the world. 
Overall, we delivered on our financial commitments in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our progress. However, with the markets remaining challenging and somewhat volatile, we have more work to do. We will keep our eye on cost controls while continuing to focus on executing our strategy, protecting our core business through solid execution, delivering our growth initiatives and investing in category-creating opportunities for the future. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Cathie."

Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA, and APJ",1540,"Thanks, Dion. 
Q3 results were largely in line with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA, and APJ continued to perform well. 
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by the unfavorable mix shift to Personal Systems and the reduction in supplies, largely due to the impact of the changes in the supplies sales model, partially offset by gross margin expansion across Personal Systems. 
Not fully evident in the year-over-year compare is the steady progress the teams have made improving our cost structure. Gross margin was down 1.1 points quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in Printing, partially offset by favorable product premium mix in Personal Systems. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.1 billion were down 25% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A as we recorded gains from the divestiture of the marketing optimization software assets. Recall that we leverage these latest gains to offset the impact of the reduced supplies into the channel related to the strategic sales model changes. We also achieved year-over-year savings via the previously communicated productivity improvements and restructuring actions. 
With a net expense of $55 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48. 
As compared to our previously provided outlook range, we recorded a higher gain from the divestiture as a result of closing more countries in Q3 than expected. The impact of the reduction in supplies revenue into the channel was in line with what we expected. The net of these amounted to about a $0.02 shift into Q3 from what we had forecasted for Q4. 
Non-GAAP net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $36 million, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $38 million and tax indemnification credits of $29 million. As we noted on the Q2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. On a GAAP basis, Q3 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49. 
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.5 billion, flat year-over-year and up 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was up 8%, while commercial revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported. We outperformed the market overall as well as in the commercial and consumer markets while staying focused on gaining profitable share. We saw momentum in certain segments of the market, particularly in consumer, and took advantage of the opportunities presented with innovative products, including the x360, Spectre 13 and the new OMEN gaming portfolio. 
As a result of our continued focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in Commercial Mobility, especially detachables, and in Services. 
Personal Systems ASPs were flat sequentially and down low single digits year-over-year. We continued to see a decline in commercial ASPs year-over-year, given the increased mix of Chromebooks. However, consumer ASPs improved both year-over-year and sequentially due to a strong premium mix. 
Personal Systems operating profit rate was 4.4%, up 1.6 points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion and tight expense management. Gross margin improvement was driven by cost reductions and premium mix, exceeding currency headwinds and competitive pricing. 
Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. We made good progress, particularly in hardware placements. Hardware units were down 10% year-over-year, significantly better than 16% last quarter as the cost actions we continue to implement increased the number of positive NPV units that could be placed. We attribute approximately 5 to 6 points of the year-over-year decline to the market, and the rest of the decline is split between less attractive units and channel inventory reductions in Q3 '16. 
In Q3, supplies revenue was down 18% year-over-year as reported or down 13% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Approximately 7 points of the constant currency decline was associated with the planned reduction of supplies sales into the channel, with the remainder being a combination of the separation-related channel inventory build in Q3 '15 and declines in our Four Box Model drivers. While Four Box Model drivers declined year-over-year, they performed in line with what we expected. 
Q3 supplies revenue mix was 64%, down approximately 3 points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the planned reduction of sales into the channel. Supplies channel inventory was down year-over-year and within our targeted range. 
Operating profit for Printing was 20.4%, up 3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain from the software asset divestiture in excess of the expected supplies channel inventory reduction and marketing investments. 
Related to the divestiture announcement on June 20, we recorded a gain of $280 million in SG&A. This was greater than the estimate of $245 million provided on the June 21 supplies call due to the acceleration of the close into Q3. This will not have an EPS impact overall for the full fiscal year but will mean that Q4 will be lower by about $0.02 compared to what we guided in June. 
R&D for Printing was up both year-over-year and sequentially due to the ramp-up of investments to support A3 copiers and 3D printing. 
Moving to an update on restructuring. Approximately 1,000 people exited the company in Q3 and approximately 2,300 year-to-date. The FY '16 restructuring activities are on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to seek efficiencies in our processes and will likely have more savings opportunities beyond 2016. The potential related actions will be announced at a later date, once we have a plan in place. 
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $1 billion. Cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, a 5-day sequential improvement, driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a 3-day increase in days of inventory. Days payable outstanding increased due primarily to Personal Systems, which had favorable linearity, volume and supplier mix. Days of inventory was up largely in line with normal seasonality. 
During our third fiscal quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares and paid $212 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $269 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly be within and potentially above our original 50% to 75% target range for returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for Q4. In Personal Systems, in line with the external analysts, we expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with incremental pressure in the Commercial segment. 
In Printing, we expect to continue to make progress on our cost structure, giving us the opportunity to place more NPV-positive units. As a result, we expect print revenue and hardware unit declines to continue to moderate year-over-year. 
Our execution of the change in the supplies sales model is expected to be in line with the $225 million reduction in revenue that we guided in June. We believe declines in supplies revenue in constant currency will continue but moderate. Supplies revenue is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. 
In Q4 and beyond, the uncertainty in the market caused by Brexit could create challenges, particularly in EMEA. A negative impact in gross domestic product could introduce risk to our revenue, particularly supplies, given the correlation we've seen in the past. We will continue to provide updates as things progress and more definitive information is available. 
As it relates to cash flow assumptions, in Q3, we started to note some issues with component supply availability in the Personal Systems market, given vendors shifting capacity to other product category. In Q4, we intend to opportunistically leverage the balance sheet for assurance of supply, which is expected to increase owned inventory and extend the cash conversion cycle by a few days. We also expect our capital expenditures to be greater in Q4 as compared to Q3. And lastly, we expect Printing revenue to be better sequentially as compared to lower quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in Personal Systems. 
On a GAAP-only basis, we assumed a settlement expense of approximately $200 million for a lump-sum offering we made during Q3 to certain terminated vested participants in the U.S. pension plan. 
With all that in mind, Q4 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Q4 '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.22 to $0.25. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.62. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.46 to $1.49. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so one of the things I'll call out -- even though I have said that in the second half I do think that the margins are going to be kind of in that 17% range for Printing. We are significantly, from Q3 to Q4, we are significantly increasing the amount of NPV positive units that we're placing. So that growth in units is well in excess of normal seasonality, and that does put pressure on kind of the bottom line. Certainly when you look at it sequentially, we're offsetting some of that with great cost improvement."

We're taking the cost out of the system so that we can effectively increase our total available market as we go after those NPV positive units. We are leveraging the strongest portfolio we've had in decades. We have real tangible differentiation in security embedded within the products. We have new business models like Instant Ink. And as those costs come out, you've seen over the course of the last 3 quarters the investment that we're making in units. In Q1, if you'll recall, we were down 20% in units. In Q2, we were down 16%. And in Q3, we were down 10%. So a 6-point improvement quarter-over-quarter as those costs come out that we place for units. To answer your second question around PC margins, I would say that our strategy has always been the same here. We're after profitable growth in this business. I think we run a very highly disciplined approach to profitable share expansion. It's about a number of things. It's taking costs out. Costs always have to come out. It's about segmenting the market. It's finding heat in the market today, anticipating where the heat is in the market in the future and skating to the puck and innovating with sprinkles of magic that allow -- enable you to differentiate the product. And so therefore, we choose where we want to play and where we don't want to play. And as a result of that, I think Ron and the team did just an outstanding job this quarter of executing to that strategy. And we yielded sort of the trifecta of growth in revenue, margin expansion and profitable share gain. And I think as a result of that, there's a range of somewhere between 3.5% to 5% that this business will deliver. But what's really important is as revenue declines abate, the negative cash conversion cycle of this business is very attractive."

What's less clear is not so much what the currency impact is and how we adjust to the currency impact, whether it's through hedges or through price increases, it's really what is going to be the impact on demand. What is GDP going to actually do, both in the U.K. and then frankly, if it spreads broader to EMEA. And it's just too early to tell. So we're going to keep, obviously, monitoring this very carefully.

I also think it is important that our view isn't that it's a linear path from whatever quarter you start out to stabilization. So it's not as if you're going to make progress every single quarter because of the lumpiness with which we place units and didn't place some units at the beginning of the year because there just weren't as many positive NPV units, we are going to see some lumpiness. What's really important is that our Four Box Model is predicting each quarter what we had -- what the results would be and doing it fairly accurately.

And that's the largest change that we made to GAAP versus the changes that we also made on the non-GAAP side. And I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the rest of your question."

But in Q4, again, one of the biggest dynamics in Q4, and I can go through all the different puts and takes, but probably the biggest dynamic in Q4 is the fact that the Printing business that has a positive cash conversion cycle is growing sequentially better than normal seasonality. And they declined in -- sequentially in Q3, whereas the Personal Systems business is, in fact, not growing as quickly sequentially and below normal seasonality, and they've got the negative cash conversion cycle. And so it's kind of a double whammy from a cash conversion cycle perspective and cash perspective in Q4. The way we think about the cash conversion cycle is that at the end of Q4, we will have a cash conversion cycle that is several days better than last year's negative 19 days but it will back up from Q3. We don't expect to have another quarter of minus 29 days, again because of this business mix impact and the fact that one of our businesses has a positive cash conversion cycle and is growing. And the one with a negative cash conversion cycle is growing but not as rapidly as it did in Q3."

We not only have the lower-end cost Chromebooks, but we also have high-end Chromebooks with really attractive Z-hide [ph] ruggedized for education that's helping stabilize some of the pricing. But it is being offset by lower priced Chromebooks that we're delivering as well.

I'm pleased to announce another quarter of solid progress in both innovation and execution. As we wrap up our first fiscal year as HP Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are making in our core growth and future framework.
In quarter 4, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we achieved net revenue growth nominally [ph] and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.60, within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded expectations for free cash flow, delivering $2.8 billion and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high end of our 50% to 75% target range.
This time last year, we faced industry-wide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success. We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational discipline. What's notable is we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term profitable growth. And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever.
While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited fiscal '16 with momentum and confidence in our ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of '17, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing.
Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across consumer, commercial, notebooks, desktops, workstations and services. Each delivered top line growth despite an overall tough and competitive market.
Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all 3 regions, yielding a record high position of 21.4% market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition.
In line with our core strategy, we focused on highly segmented, profitable opportunities where we chose to play. We continued momentum in the Consumer premium and gaming segments, enabling us to beat Consumer notebook market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8%, with accelerated growth in higher-margin offerings, including CapEx and other Commercial services.
We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences that amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMENx [ph] gaming platform for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave and Elite Slice PCs. [ph] These systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design. We are setting the standard for highly innovative and beautiful devices, taking profitable market share and forcing our competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers.
Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year-over-year, with units up 1% as compared to declines of 20% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 and 10% in quarter 3. In addition, we improved ASPs both year-over-year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter 4, we saw some pockets of improved competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen. We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing, with a focus on shifting the sales mix towards units that deliver higher value over their lifetime.
In quarter 4, we continue to execute the supplies sales model change that we announced in quarter 3, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing. As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in supply channel inventory, in line with our outlook.
We are now well positioned as we enter fiscal 2017, and we'll continue to increase marketing spend to drive HP regional supply's brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for supplies in the new omnichannel reality.
While we continue to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful group of show, [ph] with constant currency growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter 4, we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cympress [ph] are now taking full advantage of the benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address peak holiday season demand.
Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, our consumer subscription service which continue to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees.
Earlier this quarter at our annual Global Partner Conference, [ph] we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3 multifunction printers and services which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can grow profitably.
In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced partner-first program updates that we expect will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we introduced Device as a Service partner specialization to drive a services-led sales transformation.
As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Camelus [ph] who named HP #1 in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been #1. This is unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track in [ph] investing on our partners to help grow our mutual businesses.
In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing, Materialize, [ph] a leader in additive [ph] manufacturing and 3D Printing, is adding HP's Jet Fusion 3D Printing to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP codevelopment partners including Materialize, Jabil and Shapeways will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D printer in the next 2 weeks. Along with product installations, HP's materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, [ph] who has announced a commitment to the HP open materials program and Avonic Industries, [ph] who will introduce what they expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017.
While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP, with over 60% of revenue outside of the U.S.
We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal '17 and continue to show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us. I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of '17."

We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of the year. And in Q4, we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially with print rate improvements offsetting unfavorable segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year-over-year to provide [ph] reductions in SG&A, primarily due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year period, combined with nonrevenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing.
For the year, we achieved productivity and restructuring seatings which well exceeded $1 billion. With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, defined benefit plan settlement expense of $117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by a net tax indemnification credit of $38 million and nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million.
As we noted on the last 2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be excluded from non-GAAP results. In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided outlook range due to lower-than-expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credit.
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue of $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year-over-year, with growth in notebooks, desktops and workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with the top line strength but also with the focus on profitable share gain.
Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up 0.6 points year-over-year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher-margin units. Much like last quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas including consumer premium, gaming, commercial mobility and services. On a year-over-year basis, Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down due to normal seasonality associated with Consumer holiday sell-in, partially offset by better mix within Commercial and strong attach.
Now turning to Printing. While revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 1% year-over-year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved sequential share gains of 0.4 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure is creating incremental positive NPV units. We continue to improve the quality of our installed base, with Commercial units up 10% year-over-year. ASPs were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline. In Q4, supplies revenue was down 12% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The supplies sales model change contribute about 7 points to the year-over-year decline, similar to the impact in Q3. The Four Box Model drivers caused a 3 to 4 point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency.
Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year-over-year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this supplies model transition, we exited the second half where we expected to be, with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory.
Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year-over-year related primarily to the reduction in supplies revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of Software assets to offset the reduction of channel inventory associated with our supplies model change. We had an unfavorable mix of supplies, combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvement across the business. And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower charges than expected.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558 million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year-over-year.
On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up 2 days, offset by a 2-day improvement in accounts payable as a result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the assurance of supply, given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter. During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million primarily through cash dividend. For the full year, we returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders, at the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range.
Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook: in Personal Systems, we anticipate component shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short term; supplies revenue growth in constant currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of '17, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement trajectory in fiscal '16; in Q1, we expect the 4 boxes in our model to drive a mid-single-digit decline, pressuring total company revenue, growth and profit.
For the full year, we have assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainties that could impact market sizing and competitive dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact on revenue and profit especially in supplies given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October.
With all that in mind, our Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38; Q1 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36; our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65; and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So when you make all of the adjustments that you need to make to get to that -- and that's pretty consistent with the last 3 quarters, okay? So I think that's the way to think about it. I think it's also important, if I could add a point here and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is going to happen in the quarter as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line. For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If using go back to last year, in Q1, we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2, we were down 16%. Kind of Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4, we started to grow sequentially and, in fact, from Q3 to Q4, we grew sequentially units about 10% this quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure on -- early on in FY '17. And so it's really more the back half. But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize the supplies revenue by the end of '17 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said what we would do at the beginning and how we're reporting -- at the beginning of quarter, and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model has been pretty predictive and, certainly, over a longer history, it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about the progress that we're making."

So in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging. As a result of that, we would need to consider this the new normal and we went to work on taking costs out of the business so that we could turn negative NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter 1, negative 16% in quarter 2, negative 10% in quarter 3, plus 1% in quarter 4 was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our model, and our model is, therefore, predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency. So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units as we've often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCV perspective as did our graphics business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again.

So I'm wondering if you can comment, did you invest what you expected to invest? And did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you thought? And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at supplies growth being so weak in Q1 given that your comparison is so easy, and your supplies is [ph] a function of your last 3 to 6 years worth of sales. And so you shipped $100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware, I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a deceleration against an extra comp on supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your plan to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that because the math doesn't seem to work?"

So yes, we did execute on our marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the supplies change that we were making is really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP-branded supplies. So it's about awareness and building awareness and brand preference and print relevance. So kind of helping people understand why they should want to print. And we did execute on that. The unit acceleration was actually in -- ahead of what is normal seasonality for us. So sequentially, we grew units 10%, and our normal sequential is kind of 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good about the progress that we made, we did get acceleration on the hardware side. In terms of your second question around supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1. At this point in time, Toni, when we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline in supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and that, even with that, the model is still basically supporting the forecast that revenue in -- supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call. And the reason it is off -- significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the supplies sales model transition that we were going through without having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3, at the same time that roughly half of the plan -- for supplies transition was going through. So if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for print was in line with what we've seen in the past, midteens at 17%. So I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14%, obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3 earnings call. So we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already. In terms of your question about kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis and like from the U.S. administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what the impact that's going to have on currencies. And then it's even more complicated because, in many ways, we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold the pricing that they've had all along. It's just not clear. What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY '17, we have assumed no change in the pricing environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to '16, we have not assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive."

I still think there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't return to growth. At the beginning of the year, we anticipated that -- we expected the declines would moderate through the course of '16 and they did. And we were able to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. As a benefit of being a separated company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions. And as a result of that, we've performed significantly better than the market and taken a solid premium to the market. I think longer term, the business will continue to evolve and develop. There's a very large continuum of devices, everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that market but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum and indeed categories are being created in the x3 -- Elite x3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to a PC and a laptop. So I would characterize that the market is changing. We're ahead of that curve. We're skating towards where we believe the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great job in our gaming platform, in the premium segment, in Commercial mobility, whether it be x2 or x3. And we're unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by. Let's remember, it's a $320 billion TAM and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business and the team is expanding our business there. So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape. It has improved from the beginning of last year.

Simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the bond cost and making sure that every interconnector is exactly what we need that interconnector. And every piece of metal, is we need metal we can't use plastic. I mean really reengineering constantly the new products at the same time we're simplifying our portfolio. We're also doing process reengineering. And that we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops, we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company and technology enables us to take new processes and automate pieces of those processes. And so we're looking at that basically across the company. And my view is that's probably never done. There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency perspective. And then also just broadly, staying completely focused on reducing nonrevenue generating cost everywhere we need to do that. I think there are opportunities in warranty we've seen, there's opportunities in making sure that the discounts that we're giving are giving us the appropriate return.

So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve before many of you are going to take off here for thanksgiving. I do want to sort of close off with saying I was really proud with what the team did in quarter 4 and how we've rounded out the year. I think we enter FY '17 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position to what we were in this time last year, as you all recall. I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry, within the macroeconomic environment, but we're adapting to that change and we're turning into our opportunity. We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believe that this was going to be the new normal and we set ourselves up from across position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel proud about that. I think we're entering '17 with the right strategy, executing on core growth and future and leading the markets where we choose to play and not chasing share for share's sake but profitable growth is very important to us and stabilizing supplies by the end of '17 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us all and for all our investment investors as well.

I'm pleased to announce another quarter of solid progress in both innovation and execution. As we wrap up our first fiscal year as HP Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are making in our core growth and future framework.
In quarter 4, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we achieved net revenue growth nominally and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.60, within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded expectations for free cash flow, delivering $2.8 billion and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high end of our 50% to 75% target range.
This time last year, we faced industry-wide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success. We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational discipline. What's notable is we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term profitable growth. And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever.
While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited fiscal '16 with momentum and confidence in our ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of '17, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing.
Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across consumer, commercial, notebooks, desktops, workstations and services. Each delivered top line growth despite an overall tough and competitive market.
Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all 3 regions, yielding a record high position of 21.4% market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition.
In line with our core strategy, we focused on highly segmented, profitable opportunities where we chose to play. We continued momentum in the Consumer premium and gaming segments, enabling us to beat Consumer notebook market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8%, with accelerated growth in higher-margin offerings, including CapEx and other Commercial services.
We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences that amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMEN X gaming platform for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave and Elite Slice PCs. These systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design. We are setting the standard for highly innovative and beautiful devices, taking profitable market share and forcing our competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers.
Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year-over-year, with units up 1% as compared to declines of 20% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 and 10% in quarter 3. In addition, we improved ASPs both year-over-year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter 4, we saw some pockets of improved competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen. We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing, with a focus on shifting the sales mix towards units that deliver higher value over their lifetime.
In quarter 4, we continue to execute the supplies sales model change that we announced in quarter 3, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing. As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in supply channel inventory, in line with our outlook.
We are now well positioned as we enter fiscal 2017, and we'll continue to increase marketing spend to drive HP regional supply's brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for supplies in the new omnichannel reality.
While we continue to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful drupa show, with constant currency growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter 4, we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cimpress are now taking full advantage of the benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address peak holiday season demand.
Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, our consumer subscription service which continue to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees.
Earlier this quarter at our annual Global Partner Conference, we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3 multifunction printers and services which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can grow profitably.
In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced partner-first program updates that we expect will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we introduced Device as a Service partner specialization to drive a services-led sales transformation.
As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Canalys who named HP #1 in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been #1. This is unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track in investing on our partners to help grow our mutual businesses.
In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing, Materialise, a leader in additive manufacturing and 3D Printing, is adding HP's Jet Fusion 3D Printing to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP codevelopment partners including Materialise, Jabil and Shapeways will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D printer in the next 2 weeks. Along with product installations, HP's materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, who has announced a commitment to the HP open materials program and Evonik Industries, who will introduce what they expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017.
While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP, with over 60% of revenue outside of the U.S.
We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal '17 and continue to show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us. I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of '17."

We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of the year. And in Q4, we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially with print rate improvements offsetting unfavorable segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year-over-year driven by reductions in SG&A, primarily due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year period, combined with nonrevenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing.
For the year, we achieved productivity and restructuring savings which well exceeded $1 billion. With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, defined benefit plan settlement expense of $117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by a net tax indemnification credit of $38 million and nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million.
As we noted on the last 2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be excluded from non-GAAP results. In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided outlook range due to lower-than-expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credit.
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue of $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year-over-year, with growth in notebooks, desktops and workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with the top line strength but also with the focus on profitable share gain.
Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up 0.6 points year-over-year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher-margin units. Much like last quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas including consumer premium, gaming, commercial mobility and services. On a year-over-year basis, Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down due to normal seasonality associated with Consumer holiday sell-in, partially offset by better mix within Commercial and strong attach.
Now turning to Printing. While revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 1% year-over-year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved sequential share gains of 0.4 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure is creating incremental positive NPV units. We continue to improve the quality of our installed base, with Commercial units up 10% year-over-year. ASPs were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline. In Q4, supplies revenue was down 12% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The supplies sales model change contribute about 7 points to the year-over-year decline, similar to the impact in Q3. The Four Box Model drivers caused a 3 to 4 point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency.
Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year-over-year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this supplies model transition, we exited the second half where we expected to be, with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory.
Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year-over-year related primarily to the reduction in supplies revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of Software assets to offset the reduction of channel inventory associated with our supplies model change. We had an unfavorable mix of supplies, combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvement across the business. And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower charges than expected.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558 million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year-over-year.
On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up 2 days, offset by a 2-day improvement in accounts payable as a result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the assurance of supply, given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter. During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million primarily through cash dividend. For the full year, we returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders, at the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range.
Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook: in Personal Systems, we anticipate component shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short term; supplies revenue growth in constant currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of '17, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement trajectory in fiscal '16; in Q1, we expect the 4 boxes in our model to drive a mid-single-digit decline, pressuring total company revenue, growth and profit.
For the full year, we have assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainties that could impact market sizing and competitive dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact on revenue and profit especially in supplies given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October.
With all that in mind, our Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38; Q1 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36; our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65; and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

In terms of the -- what we are now coining the Four Box drivers, the Four Box drivers actually had a decline in constant currency for the quarter in minus 3% to minus 4%. So when you make all of the adjustments that you need to make to get to that -- and that's pretty consistent with the last 3 quarters, okay? So I think that's the way to think about it. I think it's also important, if I could add a point here and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is going to happen in the quarter as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line. For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If using go back to last year, in Q1, we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2, we were down 16%. Kind of Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4, we started to grow sequentially and, in fact, from Q3 to Q4, we grew sequentially units about 10% this quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure on -- early on in FY '17. And so it's really more the back half. But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize the supplies revenue by the end of '17 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said what we would do at the beginning and how we're reporting -- at the beginning of quarter, and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model has been pretty predictive and, certainly, over a longer history, it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about the progress that we're making."

So in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging. As a result of that, we would need to consider this the new normal and we went to work on taking costs out of the business so that we could turn negative NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter 1, negative 16% in quarter 2, negative 10% in quarter 3, plus 1% in quarter 4 was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our model, and our model is, therefore, predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency. So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units as we've often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCV perspective as did our graphics business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again.

So I'm wondering if you can comment, did you invest what you expected to invest? And did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you thought? And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at supplies growth being so weak in Q1 given that your comparison is so easy, and your supplies is a function of your last 3 to 6 years' worth of sales. And so you shipped $100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware, I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a deceleration against an extra comp on supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your plan to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that because the math doesn't seem to work?"

So yes, we did execute on our marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the supplies change that we were making is really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP-branded supplies. So it's about awareness and building awareness and brand preference and print relevance. So kind of helping people understand why they should want to print. And we did execute on that. The unit acceleration was actually in -- ahead of what is normal seasonality for us. So sequentially, we grew units 10%, and our normal sequential is kind of 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good about the progress that we made, we did get acceleration on the hardware side. In terms of your second question around supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1. At this point in time, Toni, when we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline in supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and that, even with that, the model is still basically supporting the forecast that revenue in -- supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them.

There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call. And the reason it is off -- significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the supplies sales model transition that we were going through without having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3, at the same time that roughly half of the plan -- for supplies transition was going through. So if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for print was in line with what we've seen in the past, midteens at 17%. So I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14%, obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3 earnings call. So we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already. In terms of your question about kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis and like from the U.S. administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what the impact that's going to have on currencies. And then it's even more complicated because, in many ways, we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold the pricing that they've had all along. It's just not clear. What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY '17, we have assumed no change in the pricing environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to '16, we have not assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive."

I still think there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't returned to growth. At the beginning of the year, we anticipated that -- we expected the declines would moderate through the course of '16, and they did. And we were able to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. As a benefit of being a separated company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions. And as a result of that, we've performed significantly better than the market and taken a solid premium to the market. I think longer term, the business will continue to evolve and develop. There's a very large continuum of devices, everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that market, but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum. And indeed, categories are being created in the x3. Elite x3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to a PC and a laptop. So I would characterize that the market is changing, we're ahead of that curve, we're skating towards where we believe the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great job in our gaming platform, in the premium segment, in commercial mobility, whether it be x2 or x3, and we're unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by. Let's remember it's a $320 billion TAM, and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business and the team is expanding our business there. So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape. It has improved from the beginning of last year. And we don't broadly disagree with the outlook from the analysts but I think what you can expect us to do is continue to deliver ahead of the market."

We expect it to close within the 9 to 12 months from the original announcement date. The team is on the ground working very closely with Samsung counterparts to get this done. We continue to be incredibly impressed with the quality and the caliber of the people as well as the technology. Of course, Samsung represents more than 10% of South Korea's total GDP and attract the very best talent in the entire country. And having that group of very high-caliber engineering and other folks join our company is very impressive. The 6,500 patents are very high-quality patents as we continue to work through that. And it gives us all the opportunity to disrupt this $55 billion market. So that's on the Samsung side. We've been running a separate track really through the course of the entire '16 as we were looking to really aggressively enter the A3 market on the go-to-market side of things. And I have traveled all around the world, met with the largest A3 channel partners. Most -- many of which are not channel partners for HP [indiscernible] which are the -- the Venn diagram is not mutually exclusive here. And I think we've made tremendous progress. We've shared with them the value proposition of working with HP and our disruption in the space, and we have an incredible amount of interest right across the globe from these go-to-market partners as we begin to unlock and even begin closing on opportunities that we expect to deliver on as we launched the products in the April time frame."

Simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the BOM cost and making sure that every interconnector is exactly what we need that interconnector. And every piece of metal is we need metal, we can't use plastic. I mean really reengineering constantly the new products, at the same time, we're simplifying our portfolio. We're also doing process reengineering. And that -- we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops, we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company, and technology enables us to take new processes and automate pieces of those processes.

There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency perspective and then also just broadly staying completely focused on reducing nonrevenue-generating cost everywhere we need to do that.

So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve before many of you are going to take off here for Thanksgiving. I do want to sort of close off with saying I was really proud of what the team did in quarter 4 and how we rounded out the year. I think we enter FY '17 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position to what we're in this time last year, as you all recall. I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry, within the macroeconomic environment, but we're adapting to that change and we're turning into our opportunity. We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believe that this was going to be the new normal, and we set ourselves up from a cost position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel proud about that. I think we're entering '17 with the right strategy, executing on core growth and future and leading in the market where we choose to play and not chasing share for share's sake but profitable growth is very important to us, and stabilizing supplies by the end of '17 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us and for all our investors as well.

As we wrap up our first fiscal year as HP Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are making in our core growth and future framework.
In quarter 4, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we achieved net revenue growth nominally and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.60, within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded expectations for free cash flow, delivering $2.8 billion, and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high end of our 50% to 75% target range.
This time last year, we faced industry-wide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success. We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational discipline. What's notable is we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term profitable growth. And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever.
While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited fiscal '16 with momentum and confidence in our ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of '17, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing.
Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across Consumer, Commercial, Notebooks, Desktops, Workstations and Services. Each delivered top line growth despite an overall tough and competitive market.
Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all 3 regions, yielding a record high position of 21.4% market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition.
In line with our core strategy, we focused on highly segmented, profitable opportunities where we chose to play. We continued momentum in the Consumer Premium and Gaming segments, enabling us to beat Consumer Notebook market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8%, with accelerated growth in higher-margin offerings, including CapEx and other Commercial services.
We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences that amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMEN X gaming platform for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave and Elite Slice PCs. These systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design. We are setting the standard for highly innovative and beautiful devices, taking profitable market share and forcing our competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers.
Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year-over-year, with units up 1% as compared to declines of 20% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 and 10% in quarter 3. In addition, we improved ASPs both year-over-year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter 4, we saw some pockets of improved competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen. We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing, with a focus on shifting the sales mix towards units that deliver higher value over their lifetime.
In quarter 4, we continued to execute the Supplies sales model change that we announced in quarter 3, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing. As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in Supplies channel inventory, in line with our outlook.
We are now well positioned as we enter fiscal 2017 and will continue to increase marketing spend to drive HP regional Supplies brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for Supplies in the new omnichannel reality.
While we continued to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful drupa show, with constant currency growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter 4 we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cimpress are now taking full advantage of the benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address peak holiday season demand.
Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, our consumer subscription service which continued to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees.
Earlier this quarter, at our annual Global Partner Conference, we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3 multifunction printers and services which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can grow profitably.
In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced partner-first program updates that we expect will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we introduced Device as a Service partner specialization to drive a services-led sales transformation.
As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Canalys who named HP #1 in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been #1. This is unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track in investing in our partners to help grow our mutual businesses.
In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing, Materialise, a leader in additive manufacturing and 3D printing, is adding HP's Jet Fusion 3D printer to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP codevelopment partners, including Materialise, Jabil and Shapeways, will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D printer in the next 2 weeks. Along with product installations, HP's materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, who has announced a commitment to the HP open materials program, and Evonik Industries, who will introduce what they expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017.
While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP, with over 60% of revenue outside of the U.S.
We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal '17 and continue to show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us. I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of '17."

We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of the year, and in Q4 we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ both sequentially and year-over-year.
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially with Print rate improvements offsetting unfavorable segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year-over-year driven by reductions in SG&A, primarily due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year period, combined with nonrevenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing.
For the year, we achieved productivity and restructuring savings which well exceeded $1 billion. With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, defined benefit plan settlement expense of $117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by net tax indemnification credits of $38 million and nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million.
As we noted on the last 2 earnings calls, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be excluded from non-GAAP results. 
In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided outlook range due to lower-than-expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credits.
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue of $8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year-over-year, with growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with the top line strength but also with the focus on profitable share gains.
Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up 0.6 points year-over-year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher-margin units. Much like last quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas including Consumer Premium, Gaming, Commercial Mobility and Services. On a year-over-year basis, Personal System ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down due to normal seasonality associated with Consumer holiday sell-in, partially offset by better mix within Commercial and strong attach.
Now turning to Printing. While revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 1% year-over-year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved sequential share gains of 0.4 points in Laser and 1 point in Ink Hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure is creating incremental positive NPV units. 
We continue to improve the quality of our installed base, with Commercial units up 10% year-over-year. ASPs were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline. In Q4, Supplies revenue was down 12% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The Supplies sales model change contributed about 7 points of the year-over-year decline, similar to the impact in Q3. The Four Box Model drivers caused a 3 to 4 point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency.
Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year-over-year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the Supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this Supplies model transition, we exited the second half where we expected to be, with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory.
Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year-over-year, related primarily to the reduction in Supplies revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of Software assets to offset the reduction of channel inventory associated with our Supplies model change. We had an unfavorable mix of Supplies, combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvements across the business. And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower charges than expected.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558 million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year-over-year.
On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up 2 days, offset by a 2-day improvement in accounts payable as a result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the assurance of supply, given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter. During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million primarily through cash dividend. For the full year, we returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders, at the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range.
Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook: in Personal Systems, we anticipate component shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short term; Supplies revenue growth in constant currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of '17, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement trajectory in fiscal '16; in Q1, we expect the 4 boxes in our model to drive a mid-single-digit decline, pressuring total company revenue, growth and profit.
For the full year, we have assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact market sizing and competitive dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact on revenue and profit, especially in Supplies, given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October.
With all that in mind, our Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38; Q1 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36; our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65; and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And if so, how long do you think you'll continue to do so or have the need to? 
And second of all, with the shortages of supply and you were able to get the components, how come your gross margins for PCs were not -- your operating margins for PCs were not stronger quarter-over-quarter as the revenues grew considerably quarter-over-quarter but operating margins didn't? Did you like reinvest some of the money? Or how should we think about why more of the PC didn't flow through?"

Let me say, broadly speaking, that the basket of components that make up a PC, there's some components in there that are in ready supply. There's other components in there that are in tighter supply, as we alluded to on the last call. And indeed, we did say we would leverage the balance sheet to go off and ensure that we procured. That is one of the changes that I've often talked about and a common theme that we have in the business, to take that change and turn it into opportunity. 
I think the team executed really well in the course of quarter 4 against that backdrop. I think the team did trifecta squared last quarter: They grew revenue, margin and share and they did it again this quarter, and I was pleased with their performance. Specifically on the margin rates, I'll let Cathie chime in."

On the supply side, Cathie, you said it's not going to be linear, which you said before, I think. But when I look at this quarter, if you back out the 7-point hit on growth in Supplies from the inventory drawdown, I know there's probably some currency impact in there as well. The Supplies business is probably down quite low single-digits. You're quite close to getting back to stability. Is there a reason why, let's say, in the first half of the year that could get worse before it gets better, if you can just explain some of those dynamics. Maybe it's comps, maybe it's how you're placing units right now, anything along those lines as we think about the next few quarters before you hit that more stable point by the end of '17 would be helpful."

In terms of the -- what we are now coining the Four Box drivers, the Four Box drivers actually had a decline in constant currency for the quarter in minus 3% to minus 4%. So when you make all of the adjustments that you need to make to get to that -- and that's pretty consistent with the last 3 quarters, okay? So I think that's the way to think about it. 
I think it's also important, if I could add a point here, and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is going to happen in the quarter as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line. 
For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If you go back to last year, in Q1 we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2 we were down 16%. Kind of Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4 we started to grow sequentially and, in fact, from Q3 to Q4 we grew sequentially units about 10% this quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure on -- early on in FY '17. And so it's really more the back half. 
But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize the Supplies revenue by the end of '17 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said we would do at the beginning and how we're reporting -- beginning of the quarter and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model has been pretty predictive. And certainly over a longer history it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about the progress that we're making."

So in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging, as a result of that we would need to consider this the new normal and we went to work on taking costs out of the business so that we could turn negative NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter 1, negative 16% in quarter 2, negative 10% in quarter 3, plus 1% in quarter 4 was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our model, and our model is, therefore, predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency. 
So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units, as we've often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCV perspective, as did our Graphics business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the Graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again.

So I'm wondering if you can comment, did you invest what you expected to invest? And did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you thought? 
And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at Supplies growth being so weak in Q1 given that your comparison is so easy and your Supplies is a function of your last 3 to 6 years' worth of sales. And so you shipped $100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware. I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a deceleration against an extra comp on Supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your plan to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that? Because the math doesn't seem to work."

So yes, we did execute on our marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the Supplies change that we were making is really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP-branded supplies. So it's about awareness and -- building awareness and brand preference and print relevance. So kind of helping people understand why they should want to print. And we did execute on that. 
The unit acceleration was actually ahead of what is normal seasonality for us. So sequentially we grew units 10%, and our normal sequential is kind of the 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good about the progress that we made. We did get acceleration on the Hardware side. 
In terms of your second question around Supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1, at this point in time, Toni, when we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline in Supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and that, even with that, the model is still basically supporting the forecast that revenue in -- Supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

If the yen continues to weaken, then you may find that more difficult to do. So I just wanted to check that in light of the currency movements."

There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one, in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings cal",408,"Sure. There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one, in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call. And the reason it is off -- significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the Supplies sales model transition that we were going through without having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3 at the same time that roughly half of the plan for Supplies transition was going through. 
So if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for Print was in line with what we've seen in the past, mid-teens at 17%. So I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14%, obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3 earnings call. So we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already. 
In terms of your question about kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis, like from the U.S. administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what -- the impact that's going to have on currencies. 
And then it's even more complicated because in many ways we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold the pricing that they've had all along. It's just not clear. 
What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY '17, we have assumed no change in the pricing environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to '16, we have not assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing, nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive."

I still think there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't returned to growth. At the beginning of the year we anticipated that -- we expected the declines would moderate through the course of '16, and they did. And we were able to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. 
As a benefit of being a separated company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions. And as a result of that, we've performed significantly better than the market and taken a solid premium to the market. 
I think longer term the business will continue to evolve and develop. There's a very large continuum of devices, everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that market, but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum. And indeed, categories are being created in the x3. Elite x3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to a PC and a laptop. 
So I would characterize that the market is changing, we're ahead of that curve, we're skating towards where we believe the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great job in our Gaming platform, in the Premium segment, in Commercial Mobility, whether it be x2 or x3, and we're unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by. 
Let's remember, it's a $320 billion TAM, and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business and the team is expanding our business there. So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape. It has improved from the beginning of last year. And we don't broadly disagree with the outlook from the analysts, but I think what you can expect us to do is continue to deliver ahead of the market."

Of course, Samsung represents more than 10% of South Korea's total GDP and attract the very best talent in the entire country. And having that group of very high-caliber engineering and other folks join our company is very impressive. The 6,500 patents are very high-quality patents as we continue to work through that. And it gives us all the opportunity to disrupt this $55 billion market. So that's on the Samsung side. 
We've been running a separate track really through the course of the entire '16 as we were looking to really aggressively enter the A3 market on the go-to-market side of things. And I have traveled all around the world, met with the largest A3 channel partners, most -- many of which are not channel partners for HP today, some of which are.

And it's all the things that we've been talking about in '16 that, frankly, have opportunity in '17 as well: simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the BOM cost and making sure that every interconnector is exactly what -- we need that interconnector and every piece of metal is -- we need metal, we can't use plastic. I mean really reengineering constantly the new products at the same time we're simplifying our portfolio. 
We're also doing process reengineering. And that -- we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops, we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company. And technology enables us to take new processes and automate pieces of those processes. And so we're looking at that basically across the company. And my view is that's probably never done. There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency perspective. 
And then also just broadly staying completely focused on reducing nonrevenue-generating cost everywhere we need to do that. I think there are opportunities in warranty we've seen.

So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve before many of you are going to take off here for Thanksgiving. I do want to sort of close off with saying I was really proud of what the team did in quarter 4 and how we rounded out the year. I think we enter FY '17 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position to what we were in this time last year, as you will recall. 
I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry, within the macroeconomic environment, but we're adapting to that change and we're turning it to our opportunity. We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believed that this was going to be the new normal, and we set ourselves up from a cost position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel proud about that. 
I think we're entering '17 with the right strategy, executing on core growth in future and leading in the market where we choose to play and not chasing share for share's sake. But profitable growth is very important to us. And stabilizing Supplies by the end of '17 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us and I know for all our investors as well. 
I have great confidence in HP, and I'm really convinced that the best years lie ahead of us. Thank you for taking the time. Happy Thanksgiving."

I'm pleased to announce another quarter of solid progress in both innovation and execution. As we wrap up our first fiscal year as HP Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are making in our core growth and future framework.
In quarter 4, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we achieved net revenue growth nominally and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.60, within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded expectations for free cash flow, delivering $2.8 billion, and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high end of our 50% to 75% target range.
This time last year, we faced industry-wide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success. We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational discipline. What's notable is we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term profitable growth. And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever.
While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited fiscal '16 with momentum and confidence in our ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of '17, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing.
Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across Consumer, Commercial, Notebooks, Desktops, Workstations and Services. Each delivered top line growth despite an overall tough and competitive market.
Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all 3 regions, yielding a record high position of 21.4% market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition.
In line with our core strategy, we focused on highly segmented, profitable opportunities where we chose to play. We continued momentum in the Consumer Premium and Gaming segments, enabling us to beat Consumer Notebook market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8%, with accelerated growth in higher-margin offerings, including CapEx and other Commercial services.
We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences that amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMEN X gaming platform for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave and Elite Slice PCs. These systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design. We are setting the standard for highly innovative and beautiful devices, taking profitable market share and forcing our competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers.
Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year-over-year, with units up 1% as compared to declines of 20% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 and 10% in quarter 3. In addition, we improved ASPs both year-over-year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter 4, we saw some pockets of improved competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen. We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing, with a focus on shifting the sales mix towards units that deliver higher value over their lifetime.
In quarter 4, we continued to execute the supplies sales model change that we announced in quarter 3, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing. As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in supplies channel inventory, in line with our outlook.
We are now well positioned as we enter fiscal 2017 and will continue to increase marketing spend to drive HP regional supplies brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for supplies in the new omnichannel reality.
While we continued to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful drupa show, with constant currency growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter 4 we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cimpress are now taking full advantage of the benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address peak holiday season demand.
Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, our consumer subscription service which continued to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees.
Earlier this quarter, at our annual Global Partner Conference, we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3 multifunction printers and services which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can grow profitably.
In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced partner-first program updates that we expect will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we introduced Device as a Service partner specialization to drive a services-led sales transformation.
As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Canalys who named HP #1 in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been #1. This is unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track in investing in our partners to help grow our mutual businesses.
In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing, Materialise, a leader in additive manufacturing and 3D printing, is adding HP's Jet Fusion 3D printer to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP codevelopment partners, including Materialise, Jabil and Shapeways, will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D printer in the next 2 weeks. Along with product installations, HP's materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, who has announced a commitment to the HP open materials program, and Evonik Industries, who will introduce what they expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017.
While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP, with over 60% of revenue outside of the U.S.
We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal '17 and continue to show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us. I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of '17."

We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of the year, and in Q4 we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ both sequentially and year-over-year.
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially with Print rate improvements offsetting unfavorable segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year-over-year driven by reductions in SG&A, primarily due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year period, combined with nonrevenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing.
For the year, we achieved productivity and restructuring savings which well exceeded $1 billion. With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, defined benefit plan settlement expense of $117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by net tax indemnification credits of $38 million and nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million.
As we noted on the last 2 earnings calls, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be excluded from non-GAAP results. 
In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided outlook range due to lower-than-expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credits.
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue of $8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year-over-year, with growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with the top line strength but also with the focus on profitable share gains.
Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up 0.6 points year-over-year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher-margin units. Much like last quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas including Consumer Premium, Gaming, Commercial Mobility and Services. On a year-over-year basis, Personal System ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down due to normal seasonality associated with Consumer holiday sell-in, partially offset by better mix within Commercial and strong attach.
Now turning to Printing. While revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 1% year-over-year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved sequential share gains of 0.4 points in Laser and 1 point in Ink Hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure is creating incremental positive NPV units. 
We continue to improve the quality of our installed base, with Commercial units up 10% year-over-year. ASPs were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline. In Q4, supplies revenue was down 12% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The supplies sales model change contributed about 7 points of the year-over-year decline, similar to the impact in Q3. The Four Box Model drivers caused a 3 to 4 point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency.
Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year-over-year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this supplies model transition, we exited the second half where we expected to be, with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory.
Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year-over-year, related primarily to the reduction in supplies revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of Software assets to offset the reduction of channel inventory associated with our supplies model change. We had an unfavorable mix of supplies, combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvements across the business. And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower charges than expected.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558 million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year-over-year.
On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up 2 days, offset by a 2-day improvement in accounts payable as a result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the assurance of supply, given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter. During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million primarily through cash dividend. For the full year, we returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders, at the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range.
Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook: in Personal Systems, we anticipate component shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short term; supplies revenue growth in constant currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of '17, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement trajectory in fiscal '16; in Q1, we expect the 4 boxes in our model to drive a mid-single-digit decline, pressuring total company revenue, growth and profit.
For the full year, we have assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact market sizing and competitive dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact on revenue and profit especially in supplies, given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October.
With all that in mind, our Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38; Q1 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36; our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65; and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

That is one of the changes that I've often talked about and a common theme that we have in the business, to take that change and turn it into opportunity. 
I think the team executed really well in the course of quarter 4 against that backdrop.

On the supply side, Cathie, you said it's not going to be linear, which you said before, I think. But when I look at this quarter, if you back out the 7-point hit on growth in supplies from the inventory drawdown, I know there's probably some currency impact in there as well. The supplies business is probably down quite low single-digits. You're quite close to getting back to stability. Is there a reason why, let's say, in the first half of the year that could get worse before it gets better, if you can just explain some of those dynamics. Maybe it's comps, maybe it's how you're placing units right now, anything along those lines as we think about the next few quarters before you hit that more stable point by the end of '17 would be helpful."

In terms of the -- what we are now coining the Four Box drivers, the Four Box drivers actually had a decline in constant currency for the quarter in minus 3% to minus 4%. So when you make all of the adjustments that you need to make to get to that -- and that's pretty consistent with the last 3 quarters, okay? So I think that's the way to think about it. 
I think it's also important, if I could add a point here, and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is going to happen in the quarter as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line. 
For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If you go back to last year, in Q1 we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2 we were down 16%. Kind of Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4 we started to grow sequentially and, in fact, from Q3 to Q4 we grew sequentially units about 10% this quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure on -- early on in FY '17. And so it's really more the back half. 
But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize the supplies revenue by the end of '17 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said we would do at the beginning and how we're reporting -- beginning of the quarter and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model has been pretty predictive. And certainly over a longer history it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about the progress that we're making."

So in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging, as a result of that we would need to consider this the new normal and we went to work on taking costs out of the business so that we could turn negative NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter 1, negative 16% in quarter 2, negative 10% in quarter 3, plus 1% in quarter 4 was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our model, and our model is, therefore, predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency. 
So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units, as we've often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCV perspective, as did our Graphics business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the Graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again. And so many of the dimensions that we've talked about, not just the unit placement but the quality of the units, is operating according to our outlook."

The reason I ask is it looks like Printer Hardware sort of improved with normal seasonality in Q4. And certainly the way you talked about last quarter was that your demand stimulation efforts would yield something significantly higher than that. So I'm wondering if you can comment, did you invest what you expected to invest? And did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you thought? 
And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at supplies growth being so weak in Q1 given that your comparison is so easy and your supplies is a function of your last 3 to 6 years' worth of sales. And so you shipped $100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware. I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a deceleration against an extra comp on supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your plan to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that? Because the math doesn't seem to work."

So yes, we did execute on our marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the supplies change that we were making is really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP-branded supplies. So it's about awareness and -- building awareness and brand preference and print relevance. So kind of helping people understand why they should want to print. And we did execute on that. 
The unit acceleration was actually ahead of what is normal seasonality for us. So sequentially we grew units 10%, and our normal sequential is kind of the 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good about the progress that we made. We did get acceleration on the Hardware side. 
In terms of your second question around supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1, at this point in time, Toni, when we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline in supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and that, even with that, the model is still basically supporting the forecast that revenue in -- supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17."

And we see this unit number stabilization is a little bit better than we thought it would be. So I'm just curious how you would expect that margin to track through the beginning of the year, especially given the yen strength. Because it seems like, if you guys want to achieve your goals in supplies, you need to keep placing these units. If the yen -- or I'm sorry, the yen weakness. If the yen continues to weaken, then you may find that more difficult to do. So I just wanted to check that in light of the currency movements."

There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one, in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings cal",408,"Sure. There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one, in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call. And the reason it is off -- significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the supplies sales model transition that we were going through without having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3 at the same time that roughly half of the plan for supplies transition was going through. 
So if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for Print was in line with what we've seen in the past, mid-teens at 17%. So I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14%, obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3 earnings call. So we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already. 
In terms of your question about kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis, like from the U.S. administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what -- the impact that's going to have on currencies. 
And then it's even more complicated because in many ways we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold the pricing that they've had all along. It's just not clear. 
What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY '17, we have assumed no change in the pricing environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to '16, we have not assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing, nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive."

I still think there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't returned to growth. At the beginning of the year we anticipated that -- we expected the declines would moderate through the course of '16, and they did. And we were able to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. 
As a benefit of being a separated company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions. And as a result of that, we've performed significantly better than the market and taken a solid premium to the market. 
I think longer term the business will continue to evolve and develop. There's a very large continuum of devices, everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that market, but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum. And indeed, categories are being created in the x3. Elite x3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to a PC and a laptop. 
So I would characterize that the market is changing, we're ahead of that curve, we're skating towards where we believe the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great job in our Gaming platform, in the Premium segment, in Commercial Mobility, whether it be x2 or x3, and we're unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by. 
Let's remember, it's a $320 billion TAM, and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business and the team is expanding our business there. So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape. It has improved from the beginning of last year. And we don't broadly disagree with the outlook from the analysts, but I think what you can expect us to do is continue to deliver ahead of the market."

On the productivity side of the house, it is -- there is not a single silver bullet for us to -- or a lever to pull. It's really going to be across a number of dimensions. And it's all the things that we've been talking about in '16 that, frankly, have opportunity in '17 as well: simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the BOM cost and making sure that every interconnector is exactly what -- we need that interconnector and every piece of metal is -- we need metal, we can't use plastic. I mean really reengineering constantly the new products at the same time we're simplifying our portfolio. 
We're also doing process reengineering. And that -- we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops, we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company. And technology enables us to take new processes and automate pieces of those processes. And so we're looking at that basically across the company. And my view is that's probably never done. There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency perspective. 
And then also just broadly staying completely focused on reducing nonrevenue-generating cost everywhere we need to do that. I think there are opportunities in warranty we've seen.

I think we have much less product on promotion than we had in the past, and that's in a more stabilized pricing environment in an omnichannel world that is incredibly sensitive to large fluctuations in end user pricing. So that was the desired effect. I think we've seen significantly lower gray marketing from region to region. That was also one of the key design points. So still very early days but the signals are the right signals and the model is operating according to how we expected it to operate."

So we feel really good about that -- the progress there.

I think we've got some incredibly innovative products here that are really resonating with customers. They're now in the right price function value equation. And when you get that right, when you do the segmentation and you get the cost right and there is value, then you end up with a better result, and that's what we're seeing with the performance of the Desktop business."

We're executing better than the market at a significant premium, and we're getting upside as a result of that.
So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve before many of you are going to take off here for Thanksgiving. I do want to sort of close off with saying I was really proud of what the team did in quarter 4 and how we rounded out the year. I think we enter FY '17 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position to what we were in this time last year, as you will recall. 
I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry, within the macroeconomic environment, but we're adapting to that change and we're turning it to our opportunity. We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believed that this was going to be the new normal, and we set ourselves up from a cost position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel proud about that. 
I think we're entering '17 with the right strategy, executing on core growth in future and leading in the market where we choose to play and not chasing share for share's sake. But profitable growth is very important to us. And stabilizing supplies by the end of '17 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us and I know for all our investors as well. 
I have great confidence in HP, and I'm really convinced that the best years lie ahead of us. Thank you for taking the time. Happy Thanksgiving."
