Before Jeff begins, let me acknowledge that the performance we're discussing today is not what we or you are accustomed to seeing from American Express, and that we are taking significant actions to changed the trajectory of our business going forward.
During our remarks, we'll address 3 main questions: Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term? So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff."

To answer the question Ken's just post, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results, how they've impacted our view of our future and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also knowledge upfront the across all the periods we're discussing, there are large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends. 
To start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we have been managing throughout 2015. Versus the prior year on a reported basis, billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the full year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter and slightly below the full year growth rate, as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.
During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.
Our earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year's EPS of $5.86 [ph], which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the Global Business Travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expense.
In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth and expense control all stemmed from actions we took in late 2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving, and all these actions should further help us in 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors. 
First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%, but we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar well now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third. Our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the level elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015, and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning to lower levels in 2017.
And last. The economic, regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening.
Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 24%. Excluding the Enterprise Growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26%, which is slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business.
Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business performance by region and segment, which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain states. 
International performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4. I'd note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2015 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter, and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. 
GNS remained our fastest growing segment, with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea and Japan.
In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially at 5%, despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year.
I'll also note that lower gas prices continued to be a drag on USCS growth, as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. 
GCS billed business growth continued to slow, and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment.
Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter, as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth had more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around midyear.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 5. Loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1. We now expect the sale of the JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1, and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks.
Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios in the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since early 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. 
I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused, given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships, which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6. Reported revenues were down for the full year in the quarter, driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter, which is consistent with our full year performance. 
Looking at our major revenue drivers. Discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year, driven in part by the continued rollout of OptBlue.
Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of our OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver. Growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, which is modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Second that, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4%, even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused to the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 7. Our provision was down 2% versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issuance. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics.
Going forward, continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We'd also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new cardmembers. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic reforms.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 8. Total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognized that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward, as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results. Marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for [indiscernible] are also spending on growth initiatives since driving card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions to prior periods.
Now obviously, this is a very early signposts for our investments, and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards. Expenses were down 5% from the current quarter, driven by a $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of cardmember services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year, during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapsed as we head into 2016.
One last item I'd highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the Enterprise Growth charge, which already of which is not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016. Excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range it was trending to prior to this quarter. 
While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth and operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and in part reflects actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015, as we observed that the environment was evolved.
We have a long track record of taking costs actions when needed. Looking forward, we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions, which we expect will all result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% from the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financing strength as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 [ph] to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe in agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016, and we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.
In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans, and co-brand cardmembers will also be able to use their cards at any Amex-accepting merchants through the transaction close date. We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate the gain of approximately $1  million [ph]. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement. And given that we are still several months away from the close and the cardmember borrowing and paid down trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimates.
So now that we've concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook.
Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in each year. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year, and the repetitive economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook. I now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension and also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping bond. This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you though that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence and executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we closed the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all 4 quarters resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.
On costs. As we move through 2015 and gain more clarity on the portfolio of sales as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right size our cost base with the evolving business environment.
As a result, we have launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs by the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective, since 2007, our billed business volume have grown by over 60%, but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period.
We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those sanctions where no longer enough and we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating costs, which is why we are targeting our $1 billion cost reduction.
We plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back, think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015. There are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model revenue growth, which we believe should accelerate the 2015 levels while with operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second. The portfolio of sale gain will be partially used to fund the continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives.
Last. When the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will follow immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower-than-anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more costs to offset the lower revenue, which will take some time.
Turning to capital. The portfolio of sale will increase our capital ratios through a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities, including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you are aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital request through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio of sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017. We are now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance, there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second, we will have to lap the portfolio of sale gain along with the half year getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business.
Third. Our more aggressive cost-reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. 
And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth our [indiscernible].
Looking beyond 2017. Because there are so many moving pieces in the near term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. I would point out, however, that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate. Overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back it over to Ken, so he can provide some additional context."

And why are we confident in our abilit",1202,"Thank you, Jeff. Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term?
To get context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. This include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we sighted last year, including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices, has lasted longer than we previously expect. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years. We've recognized them. We've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency, and we're making process on many fronts. 
Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive action in the co-brand space, accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. Now we're set to take cost reduction to the next level through our $1 billion improvement program. We ramped up spending on cardmember acquisition and grown [ph] 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we're now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. 
We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results. Adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year, which expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year. With our OptBlue program, we're continuing our efforts to move to our parody coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. We grew our lending business faster than the markets while maintaining our industry best credit performance. We'll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. 
We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we've returned more than $5 billion [ph] to our shareholders last year. Although 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear. We need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes 3 priorities: Accelerate revenue growth, reduce our expense base and optimize our investments and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. 
Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step up from there. it targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the company starting in the first quarter of this year. I assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Swery, to lead the effor. He'll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He's been at the forefront of containing our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track record or making the organizations he's led more efficient and more effectively.
As this new effort advances, we'll be taking actions to reduce costs in a thoughtful way without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting or reengineering commitments, and I'm confident we'll do it again. 
At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing our investments. We'll continue to use big data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities. We'll gain efficiencies from our renewed management structure and we'll stop certain initiatives where we're not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing in the price growth using our investment dollars more efficiently to help us as we move toward the lower level of investment spending in 2017.
As we work to accelerate revenues, we'll be focused on the opportunities I sited earlier. We'll invest to grow our cardmember base and merchant network, even customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business and develop newer, adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business.
In addition to organic growth, we'll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year, and we're confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon: Our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service and a proven ability to innovate. Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for cardholders and build business for merchant partners. This is a major advantage, and it's one reason why other card issuers are trying to couple together a closed loop of their own despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments. We're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the boundaries between online and off-line blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the convergence of payments and commerce. We have a deep and experienced the management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years, and our company has always emerged stronger.
You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve, Henry Williams and Doug as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10.
Let me conclude by saying we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined to increase revenues, reduce costs and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges, return to growth and position the company for long-term success. Thank you."

I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we're in. And as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we'd expected to see. And if you go back to our Investor Day at March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February, when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp-up and what the pieces of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way. Well we have those answers now. And when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we're in, we've concluded we needed to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base. So I don't think, Don, you can really attribute it to anyone factor. It's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I have talked about this afternoon."

And certainly, that competitive pressures throughout the industry were likely to increase. And that's one of the reasons, Don, that we initiated 2 separate restructuring initiatives in 2014, which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out. And I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again, flat in 2015. Then in February, as we talked about, we recognized that termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap, and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge. We know what the situation is now. But that also would be based in part on the revenue and volume growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth is not accelerated as we would have expected. And so we're working to rightsize the cost base and the variable cost that we can take up relatively quickly, but there are fixed cost as well, and that's going to take time to transition. But I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost adjustments that we put in place and we can do it in a way that's not going to impair our ability very importantly to build on the range of growth opportunities that we've identified."

As we went through the year, that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that, Sanjay, in the context of our forward outlook, at some point, when revenue was weaker a little bit. As you know, we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times. As we got to the end of the year though and looked at a full year revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn't make sense to pull the lever as hard as we would pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and '17, and so we've adjusted course. I think there's many, many drivers of that slower revenue growth, which Ken and I tried to get into our remarks. But Ken, you probably might want to provide a little broader contexts."

If you look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers, we're at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment. And as we continue to maintain over the last several years a intensifying competitive environment. What we've seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they're making and the billings growth, they're not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better. I like it, in fact, to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think again the investments that we've made in card acquisition have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations. Now we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives, and we're allocating those dollars if we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we've said, when some of those initiatives are not working, Enterprise Growth was an example of that. What I've also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some the time as we talked about when we make the investments in when we see the returns, but I think it's not just the signpost that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the signpost that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing. Something like payment points, which we are seeing from a standpoint of young people. There is an attraction engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships, I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets.

I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend-centric versus the lend-centric, I'd go back to a point that just made in talking about the fourth quarter results. And certainly, we've said this in the past. If you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues, that range is around 15% to 20%. In the fourth quarter, it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending, and I should add to that, growing better than the industry with industry-leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend-centric model. The second thing that I would say is that the danger of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on 1 geography in the U.S. So what's interesting is when you look at small business, and I think you know this in '14, 2014, $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses but only 10% of that was on plastic. And we're -- we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with. In this case, we're competing against cash checks. And the fact that only 10% of $4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests it's a strong opportunity. I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low, and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rates. So 12% in billings growth in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumers, small business and corporate and the corporate and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks, that gives me the confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit, that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge. But we are not overly dependent on co-brands, and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing. On the merchant side, let's be very clear, Visa and MasterCard have different models. At this point in time, those models are working pretty well for them. But as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there's seachange going on in payments and commerce. So certainly, they provide an important part of the payments process. But I think increasingly, it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants. And we think direct relationships and insights, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and off-line commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation we think to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that, that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide, and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business, but I do want to avoid sort of an apples-to-orange -- oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated and that vary significantly by product and I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that as you know cardmember spending is 3 to 4x the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices [indiscernible], and that obviously is the dynamic where. But when I relate that to the importance of a we drive value going forward in direct relationships that we haven't with the end user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you've got to liquid breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull."

Ken just talk about the breadth of our business model where, in fact, we are increasingly finding days of direct sales forces as a more effective way to grow that certain of our more traditional marketing, promotional efforts, we absolutely look at that from a marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues. And so as we think about taking the $1 billion out of the cost base, we very consciously of said well the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses, there are instances were, in fact, it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses.

Even though that adds to OpEx, that it's a very good trade-off that we want to make. But I'll just come back on the rewards point because there are different categories of rewards. There is cashback, there is co-brand and the reality is you look at how we manage the costs, for example, of membership rewards I think we been able to manage the those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on Membership Rewards, it's been very strong. So I mentioned that, that segment of 30 and under is very attractive to payment points. And so do deals we've done with your BNP and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that's over 20 years old. And in fact, we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think as with other categories, when you look at rewards come we've got a segments you've got to look at the economics of Cashback, you've got to look at co-brands as we talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we've continued to evolve we've made more digital, we've made more mobile I think gives us the flexibility in how we manage the overall reward needs of our customers."

That is a change. If I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption is that we would begin to moderate that growth-oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in, as we've looked at all the things going out of the company, we've made the decision that the right thing to do for the long-term is to stay at that higher level. Now in terms of the exact amount, I guess, there's a little bit of judgment, Bill, involved in that. Certainly, a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level. Is it all a gain? Probably not. Is it majority of the gain? Probably [indiscernible] for a number [indiscernible] that's really not reflected of how we run the company. We look at the range of opportunities we have that we think makes sense.

But the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business. Middle-market was an example and small business. And I think what we've demonstrated is we've used those games in a very, very productive way. So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new cardmembers, deepening customer relationships from a lending, rewards standpoint, we believe, even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015, we see that as an area for investment going forward.

On the other side, there are different strategic initiatives and particular areas that we're going to make multiyear investments in, and we've established certain signposts to judge the effectiveness and the performance of those activities. And it is a very rigorous process that we very consistently review, not only as a management team but with our board and the comp committee in particular on a regular basis throughout the year."

I think private label, you've got to think through the different cycles. And as we look through the different cycles in private lending -- in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile it in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy. I would just say, to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall, that I would emphasize and I think its certainly one of the reasons why a Marriott made the deal is they were very, very focused on the high quality customer that Starwood has, SPG, which is what their co-branded card is called, is viewed very positively keep. You may or may not know when the deal was announced. There was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying we really love this product. There were a lot of good things so about Amex. I have a lot of respect for the Marriott management. And I think our job, as we've been doing, is to provide really, really strong value. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. So that's what we're going to be focused. On the acquisitions side, the reality is as we look at the range of different opportunities. I think the Loyalty Partner example is a very good one. One, we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have. And what you know in the Loyalty Partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on Loyalty Partner. And so we're in the early stages, as you know, with the Plenti launch. We actually announced, I think it was 2 days ago that, Chili's restaurant chain has come on. And part of what you want with this program. We've got Macy's, AT&T, ExxonMobil, nationwide, the range of companies. If you want to get people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place, redeem somewhere else and having the different need categories met is very important. So we're very happy to have Chili's in the Plenti program. But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities that obviously if we feel they're going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities, what we would look as we look at with Loyalty Partners is can be substantially improved the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that's the philosophy that we're going to take from acquisitions standpoint."

We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the breakeven points in 2015, and we think we are making good progress in that program. Two, you do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations as I talked about earlier. And three, we do have some mixed issues. So in the first half of the year, oddly enough as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada, that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the Corporate Card business, that tends to be sending a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate. And as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically relative to the U.S., that also cause us -- puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rate from a mix perspective.

To answer the question Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results, how they've impacted our view of the future and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also acknowledge upfront the across all the periods we're discussing, there are large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends. 
To start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we have been managing throughout 2015. Versus the prior year on a reported basis, billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the full year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter but slightly below the full year growth rate, as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.
During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.
Our earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year's EPS of $5.56, which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the Global Business Travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expense.
In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth and expense control all stemmed from actions we took in late 2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving, and all these actions should further help us in 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors. 
First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%, but we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar well now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third. Our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015, and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning to lower levels in 2017.
And last. The economic, regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening.
Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 24%. Excluding the Enterprise Growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26%, which is slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business performance by region and segment, which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain segments.
International performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4. I'd note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter, and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. 
GNS remained our fastest growing segment, with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis, powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea and Japan.
In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially at 5%, despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year.
I'll also note that lower gas prices continued to be a drag on USCS growth, as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. 
GCS billed business growth continued to slow, and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment.
Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around midyear.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 5. Loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1. We now expect the sale of the JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1, and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks.
Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios in the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since early 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. 
I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused, given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships, which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6. Reported revenues were down for the full year in the quarter, driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter, which is consistent with our full year performance. 
Looking at our major revenue drivers. Discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year, driven in part by the continued rollout of OptBlue.
Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver. Growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, which is modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4%, even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 7. Our provision was down 2% versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issuance. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics.
Going forward, the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We'd also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic performance.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 8. Total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward, as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results. Marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we've discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions to prior periods. Now obviously, this is a very early signpost for our investments, and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards. Expenses were down 5% in the current quarter, driven by a $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year, during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapsed this as we head into 2016.
One last item I'd highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the Enterprise Growth charge, which already of which was not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016, excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range it was trending to prior to this quarter. 
While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and in part reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015, as we observed that the environment was evolved.
We have a long track record of taking costs actions when needed. And looking forward, we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions, which we expect will all result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% from the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financing strength as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016-2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016. And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.
In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans, and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any Amex-accepting merchants through the transaction close date. We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate the gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement. And given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimate.
So now that we've concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook.
Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in each year. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year, and the competitive economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook. I now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension. It also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping to fund. This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. 
This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you, though, that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence in executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I'd emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we closed the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all 4 quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.
On costs. As we moved through 2015 and gain more clarity on the portfolio of sales as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right size our cost base with the evolving business environment.
As a result, we have launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs by the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective, since 2007, our billed business volumes have grown by over 60% but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period.
We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those actions where no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating costs, which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction.
We plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015. There are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth, which we believe should accelerate from 2015 levels, while with operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second. The portfolio of sale gain will be partially used to fund the continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives.
Last. When the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will follow immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower-than-anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more costs to offset the lower revenue, which will take some time.
Turning to capital. The portfolio of sale will increase our capital ratios through a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities, including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you are aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital request through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017. We are now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance, there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second, we will have to lap the portfolio of sale gain along with the half year getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business.
Third. Our more aggressive cost-reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. 
And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficiently. 
Looking beyond 2017. Because there are so many moving pieces in the near term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. I would point out, however, that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate. Overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Ken so he can provide some additional context."

Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term?
To give context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. 
A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we cited last year, including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices, have lasted longer than we'd previously expected. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years. We've recognized them. We've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency, and we're making progress on many fronts. 
Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive action in the co-brand space. Accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. Now we're set to take cost reduction to the next level through our $1 billion improvement program. We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we're now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. 
We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results. Adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year. We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year. With our OptBlue program, we're continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. 
We grew our lending business faster than the markets while maintaining our industry-best credit performance. We'll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. 
We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year. 
Although 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear. We need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes 3 priorities: accelerate revenue growth, reduce our expense base and optimize our investments and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. 
Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step-up from there. it targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. 
This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the company starting in the first quarter of this year. I've assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri, to lead the effort. He'll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He's been at the forefront of containing our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track record of making the organizations he's led more efficient and more effective.
As this new effort advances, we'll be taking actions to reduce costs in a thoughtful way without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting or reengineering commitments, and I'm confident we'll do it again. 
At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing our investments. We'll continue to use big data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities. We'll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we'll stop certain initiatives where we're not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing in our price growth, using our investment dollars more efficiently to help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017.
As we work to accelerate revenues, we'll be focused on the opportunities I cited earlier. We'll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business and develop newer, adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business.
In addition to organic growth, we'll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year, and we're confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon: our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service and our proven ability to innovate. 
Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage, and it's one reason why other card issuers are trying to couple together a closed loop of their own despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments. We're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the boundaries between online and off-line blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the convergence of payments and commerce. We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years, and our company has always emerged stronger.
You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anre Williams and Doug Buckminster, as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10.
Let me conclude by saying we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined to increase revenues, reduce costs and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges, return to growth and position the company for long-term success. Thank you."

We have 8% of our billings with the co-brand, another 1% for merchant -- other merchant acceptance. I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we're in. And as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we'd expected to see. And if you go back to our Investor Day at March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February, when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way. Well, we have those answers now. And when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we're in, we've concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base. So I don't think, Don, you can really attribute it to any one factor. It's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I have talked about this afternoon."

And that's one of the reasons, Don, that we initiated 2 separate restructuring initiatives in 2014, which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out. And I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again, flat in 2015. Then in February, as we talked about, we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap, and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge. We know what the situation is now. But that also would be based in part on the revenue and volume growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth is not accelerated as we would have expected. And so we're working to rightsize the cost base. There are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition. But I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we put in place and we can do it in a way that's not going to impair our ability very importantly to build on the range of growth opportunities that we've identified."

As you think about the course of 2015, we clearly did have an expectation that you would see a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues. As we went through the year, that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that, Sanjay, in the context of our forward outlook, at some point, when revenue was weaker a little bit. As you know, we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times. As we got to the end of the year, though, and looked at a full year revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn't make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and '17, and so we've adjusted course. I think there's many, many drivers of that slower revenue growth, which Ken and I tried to get into our remarks. But Ken, you probably want to provide a little broader context."

I think what's important is while certainly, Sanjay, that the revenues and the volumes are not where we want them to be, I would just go back. If we look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers, we're at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment and as we continue to maintain over the last several years an intensifying competitive environment. What we've seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they're making and the billings growth, they're not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better. I'd like it, in fact, to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think, again, the investments that we've made in card acquisition have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations. Now we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives, and we're allocating those dollars where we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we've said, when some of those initiatives are not working, Enterprise Growth was an example of that. What I've also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some lead time, as we talked about, between when we make the investments and when we see the returns. But I think it's not just the signpost that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the signpost that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing, something like payment points, which we are seeing from a standpoint of young people. There is an attraction engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships, I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets. So I think that's the balance."

Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against the backdrop of an industry quickly moving towards giving up interchange economics to triumph loan growth and share gains. So my real question's concerning the competitive backdrop and change in how your competitors are looking at their economics. How can you maintain the model long term that has traditionally allowed Amex to be valued at a premium to competitors?"

I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend-centric versus the lend-centric, I'd go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results. And certainly, we've said this in the past. If you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues, that range is around 15% to 20%. In the fourth quarter, it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending, and I should add to that, growing better than the industry with industry-leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend-centric model. The second thing that I would say is that the danger of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on 1 geography in the U.S. So what's interesting is when you look at small business, and I think you know this, in '14 -- 2014, $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses but only 10% of that was on plastic. And we're -- we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with. In this case, we're competing against cash checks. And the fact that only 10% of $4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests it's a strong opportunity. I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low, and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rates. So 12% in billings growth, in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumers, small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks, that gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit, that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge. But we are not overly dependent on co-brands, and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing. On the merchant side, let's be very clear, Visa and MasterCard have different models. At this point in time, those models are working pretty well for them. But as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there's seachange going on in payments and commerce. So certainly, they provide an important part of the payments process. But I think increasingly, it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants. And we think direct relationships and the insights, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and off-line commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation, we think, to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that, that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide, and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business, but I do want to avoid sort of an apples-to-orange -- oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated, and that vary significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that as you know cardmember spending is 3 to 4x the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in many cases, and that obviously is a dynamic where. But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward in direct relationships that we haven't with the end user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you've got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull."

And so as we think about taking the $1 billion out of the cost base, we very consciously have said, well, the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses. There are instances were, in fact, it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility to do the right things to drive revenue growth going forward."

Even though that adds to OpEx, that is a very, very good trade-off that we want to make. But I'll just come back on the rewards point because there are different categories of rewards, there is Cashback, there is Co-brands. And the reality is if you look at how we've managed the cost, for example, of membership rewards, I think we've been able to manage those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on Membership Rewards, it's been very strong. So I mentioned that, that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to pay with points. And so the deals we've done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that's over 20 years old. And in fact, we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think as with other categories, when you look at rewards, you've got a segment and you've got to look at the economics of Cashback, you've got to look at Co-brands as we've talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in Co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we've continued to evolve, we've made more digital, we've made more mobile, I think gives us the flexibility in how we manage the overall reward needs of our customers."

And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to about $4.89 that would imply a negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16. And they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to the modestly positive EPS growth. I think consensus of that plus 2%. Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that just so there's not, I guess, speculation around what -- how much of '16 is being influenced by -- or I guess, inflated by the gain?"

That is a change. If I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had been we would begin to moderate that growth-oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in, as we've looked at all the things going on in the company, we've made the decision that the right thing to do for the long term is to stay at that higher level. Now in terms of the exact amount, I guess, there's a little bit of judgment, Bill, involved in that. Certainly, a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level. Is it all the gain? Probably not. Is it the majority of the gain? Probably. I'm not going to put a firm number on it because that's quite -- that's really not reflective of how we run the company. We look at the range of opportunities we have that we think makes sense. Use our shareholders money on for the long term. We're funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain."

And where we see growth opportunities -- and those of you who followed the company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa and MasterCard private action. And so the damages claim was in, I think, the first amount tranche was probably $1 billion. I think it was $3 billion in total. I can't remember it exactly. But the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business. Middle market was an example and small business. And I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very, very productive way. So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new cardmembers, deepening customer relationships from a lending, rewards standpoint, we believe, even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015, we see that as an area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that. And I think we've had a pretty good track record of basically achieving the outcomes that we set out."

We don't think are getting -- we're getting our fair share of lend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity. I think that private label, you got to think through the different cycles. And as we look at the different cycles in private lending -- in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy. I would just say, to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall, that I would emphasize and I think its certainly one of the reasons why a Marriott made the deal is they were very, very focused on the high-quality customer that Starwood has. SPG, which is what their co-branded card is called, is viewed very positively. You may or may not know when the deal was announced. There was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying, we really love this product. There were a lot of good things said about Amex. I have a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job, as we've been doing, is to provide really, really strong value. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. So that's what we're going to be focused on. On the acquisition side, the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the Loyalty Partner example is a very good one. One, we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have. And what you know in the Loyalty Partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on Loyalty Partner. And so we're in the early stages, as you know, with the Plenti launch. We actually announced, I think it was 2 days ago, that Chili's restaurant chain has come on. And part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's, AT&T, ExxonMobil, nationwide, a range of companies, is you want to give people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place, redeem somewhere else. And having the different need categories met is very important. So we're very happy to have Chili's in the Plenti program. But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities that obviously if we feel they're going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities, what we would look as we looked at with Loyalty Partner is can we substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that's the philosophy that we're going to take from an acquisition standpoint."

In '15 alone, I would point out too, I took people through the math, as you think about the 5% or so of EPS that the Co-brand reset cost us which we'll lapd, FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so which is about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 added as the net gain from the chief Global Business Travel I think for transactions.

The drivers are really just what you said. Number one, OptBlue, as we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the breakeven point in 2015, and we think we are making great progress in that program. Two, you do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations, as I talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues, right? So in the first half of the year, oddly enough, as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada, that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the Corporate Card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate. And as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically relative to the U.S., that also cause us -- puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rate from a mix perspective. So it's all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016. And then Ken, you might want to comment in coverage in OptBlue."

I just reinforce what Jeff said is, is the growing mix of business within the retail and EveryDay sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously, some of the regulation that we're seeing in some of the key international markets. But as we've talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage, which should help our growth. Now that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that Jeff made, if we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that's going to help. But we consciously understood that with expansion of OptBlue, we were going to have a greater mix of retail and EveryDay, and that's something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our card products."

To answer the question Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results, how they've impacted our view of the future and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing, there are a large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends. 
To start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we have been managing throughout 2015. Versus the prior year, on a reported basis, billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the full year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter but slightly below the full year growth rate, as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.
During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.
Our earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year's EPS of $5.56, which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the Global Business Travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expense.
In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth and expense control all stemmed from actions we took in late 2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving, and all these actions should further help us in 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors. 
First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%, but we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third. Our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015, and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning to lower levels in 2017.
And last. The economic, regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening.
Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 24%. Excluding the Enterprise Growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26%, which is slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business performance by region and segment, which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain segments.
International performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4. I'd note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter, and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. 
GNS remained our fastest growing segment, with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis, powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea and Japan.
In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially at 5%, despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year.
I'll also note that lower gas prices continued to be a drag on USCS growth, as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. 
GCS billed business growth continued to slow, and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment.
Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around midyear.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 5. Loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1. We now expect the sale of the JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1, and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks.
Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios in the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since early 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. 
I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused, given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships, which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6. Reported revenues were down for the full year and the quarter, driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter, which is consistent with our full year performance. 
Looking at our major revenue drivers. Discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year, driven in part by the continued rollout of OptBlue.
Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver. Growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, which is modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4%, even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 7. Our provision was down 2% versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issuers. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics.
Going forward, the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic performance.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 8. Total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward, as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results. Marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we've discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions to prior periods. Now obviously, this is a very early signpost for our investments, and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards. Expenses were down 5% in the current quarter, driven by a $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year, during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapsed this as we head into 2016.
One last item I'd highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the Enterprise Growth charge, majority of which was not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016, excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range it was trending to prior to this quarter. 
While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and in part reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015, as we observed that the environment was evolved.
We have a long track record of taking costs actions when needed. And looking forward, we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions, which we expect will result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. 
We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016. And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.
In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans, and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any Amex-accepting merchants through the transaction close date. 
We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement. And given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimate.
So now that we've concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook.
Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in each year. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year, and the competitive economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook. 
I now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension. It also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping fund. This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. 
This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you, though, that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence in executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I'd emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all 4 quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.
On costs. As we moved through 2015 and gain more clarity on the portfolio sale as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost-reduction efforts to rightsize our cost base with the evolving business environment.
As a result, we have launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs by the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective, since 2007, our billed business volumes have grown by over 60% but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period.
We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those actions where no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating costs, which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction.
We plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015, there are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth, which we believe should accelerate from 2015 levels, while with operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second. The portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund the continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives.
Last. When the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will fall away immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower-than-anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more costs to offset the lower revenue, which will take some time.
Turning to capital. The portfolio sale will increase our capital ratios through a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities, including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you are aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital requests through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017. We are now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance, there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second, we will have to lap the portfolio sale gain along with the half year of getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business.
Third, our more aggressive cost-reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. 
And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficiently. 
Looking beyond 2017. Because there are so many moving pieces in the near term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. I would point out, however, that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate. And overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. 
We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Ken so he can provide some additional context."

Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our abilit",1201,"Thank you, Jeff. Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term?
To give context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. 
A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we cited last year, including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices, have lasted longer than we previously expected. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years. We've recognized them. We've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency, and we're making progress on many fronts. 
Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive action in the co-brand space. Accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. 
Now we're set to take cost reduction to the next level through our $1 billion improvement program. We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we're now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. 
We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results. Adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year. We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year. With our OptBlue program, we're continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. 
We grew our lending business faster than the market while maintaining our industry-best credit performance. We'll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. 
We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure, creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year. 
Although 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear. We need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes 3 priorities: accelerate revenue growth, reduce our expense base and optimize our investments and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. 
Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step-up from there. It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. 
This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the company starting in the first quarter of this year. I've assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri, to lead the effort. He'll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He's been at the forefront of containing our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track record of making the organizations he's led more efficient and more effective.
As this new effort advances, we'll be taking actions to reduce costs in a thoughtful way without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting our reengineering commitments, and I'm confident we'll do it again. 
At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing our investments. We'll continue to use big data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities. We'll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we'll stop certain initiatives where we're not seeing results or a clear path to results, just as we did by refocusing Enterprise Growth, using our investment dollars more efficiently to help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017.
As we work to accelerate revenues, we'll be focused on the opportunities I cited earlier. We'll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business and develop newer, adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business.
In addition to organic growth, we'll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year, and we're confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon: our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service and our proven ability to innovate. 
Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage, and it's one reason why other card issuers are trying to cobble together a closed loop of their own, despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments. We're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the boundaries between online and off-line blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the convergence of payments and commerce. 
We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years, and our company has always emerged stronger. You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anre Williams and Doug Buckminster, as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10.
Let me conclude by saying we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined: to increase revenues, reduce cost and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges: return to growth and position the company for long-term success. Thank you."

There are about 8% or -- 8% of our billings for the co-brand, another 1% for merchant -- other merchant acceptance. I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we're in. And as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see. If you go back to our Investor Day at March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way. Well, we have those answers now. And when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we're in, we've concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base. So I don't think, Don, you can really attribute it to any one factor. It's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I have talked about this afternoon."

And that's one of the reasons, Don, that we initiated 2 separate restructuring initiatives in 2014, which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out. And I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target, again, flat in 2015. Then in February, as we talked about, we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap, and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge. We know what the situation is now. But that also would be based in part on the revenue and volume growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth has not accelerated as we would have expected. And so we're working to rightsize the cost base. There are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition. But I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we've put in place and we can do it in a way that's not going to impair our ability, very importantly, to build on the range of growth opportunities that we've identified."

As we got to the end of the year, though, and looked at a full year of revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn't make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would have had to pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and '17, and so we've adjusted course.

What we've seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they're making and the billings growth, they're not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better. I'd like it, in fact, to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think, again, the investments that we've made in card acquisitions have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations. Now, we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives, and we're allocating those dollars where we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we've said, when some of those initiatives are not working, Enterprise Growth was an example of that, what I've also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some lead time, as we talked about, between when we're making investments and when we see the returns. But I think it's not just the signpost that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the signposts that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing, something like Pay with Points, which we are seeing from a standpoint of young people. There is an attraction and engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships, I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets.

Historically, Amex has been a traded premium to peers due to its spend-centric discount revenue-heavy model. Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against the backdrop of an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains. So my real question's concerning the competitive backdrop and change in how your competitors are looking at their economics. How can you maintain the model long term that has traditionally allowed Amex to be valued at a premium to competitors?"

I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend-centric versus the lend-centric, I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results. And certainly, we've said this in the past. If you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues, that range is around 15% to 20%. In the fourth quarter, it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending, and I should add to that, growing better than the industry with industry-leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend-centric model. The second thing that I would say is that the danger of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on 1 geography in the U.S. So what's interesting is when you look at small business, and I think you know this, in '14 -- 2014, $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses but only 10% of that was on plastic. And we're -- we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with. In this case, we're competing against cash and checks. And the fact that only 10% of $4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity. I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low, and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rates. So 12% in billings growth, in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer, small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks, that gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit, that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge. But we are not overly dependent on co-brands, and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing. On the merchant side, let's be very clear, Visa and MasterCard have different models. At this point in time, those models are working pretty well for them. But as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there's a sea change going on in payments and commerce. So certainly, they provide an important part of the payments process. But I think increasingly, it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants. And we think direct relationships and the insights, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and off-line commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation, we think, to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that, that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide, and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business, but I do want to avoid to have apples-to-orange -- oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated, and that varies significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that, as you know, cardmember spending is 3 to 4x the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in many cases, and that obviously is a dynamic there. But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with the end-user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you've got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull."

What we're talking about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the market and promotional area, and the operating expense area, when we look at our evolving digital acquisition, our evolving use of big data, when we look at certain markets, Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model where, in fact, we're increasingly finding the use of direct sales forces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts, we absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues. And so as we think about taking the $1 billion out of the cost base, we very consciously have said, while the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses, there are instances were, in fact, it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility to do the right things to drive revenue growth going forward."

Even though that adds to OpEx, that is a very, very good trade-off that we want to make. But I'd just come back on the rewards point because there are different categories of rewards, there is Cashback, there's co-brands. And the reality is if you look at how we've managed the cost, for example, of membership rewards, I think we've been able to manage those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on Membership Rewards, it's been very strong. So I mentioned that, that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to Pay with Points. And so the deals we've done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that's over 20 years old. And in fact, we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think, as with other categories, when you look at rewards, you've got a segment and you've got to look at the economics of Cashback, you've got to look at co-brands as we talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we've continued to evolve, we've made more digital, we've made more mobile, I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward needs of our customers."

And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to about $4.89. That would imply a negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16. And they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to, the modestly positive EPS growth. I think consensus is at plus 2%. Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that just so there's not, I guess, speculation around what -- how much of '16 is being influenced by -- or I guess, inflated by the gain?"

That is a change. If I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had been we would begin to moderate that growth-oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in, as we've looked at all the things going on in the company, we've made the decision that the right thing to do for the long term is to stay at that higher level. Now, in terms of the exact amount, I guess, there's a little bit of judgment, Bill, involved in that. Certainly, a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level. Is it all the gain? Probably not. Is it the majority of the gain? Probably. I'm not going to put a firm number on it because that's not quite -- that's really not reflective of how we run the company. We look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense to use our shareholders' money on for the long term. We're funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain."

And where we see growth opportunities -- and those of you who have followed the company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa and MasterCard private action. And so the damages claim was in -- I think the first amount tranche was probably $1 billion. I think it was $3 billion in total. I can't remember it exactly. But the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business. Middle market was an example and small business. And I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very, very productive way. So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new cardmembers, deepening customer relationships from a lending and rewards standpoint, we believe, even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015, we see that as an area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that.

We don't think are getting -- we're getting our fair share of lend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity. I think that private label, you've got to think through the different cycles. And as we look at the different cycles in private lending -- in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy. I would just say, to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall, that I would emphasize and I think it's certainly one of the reasons why Marriott made the deal is they were very, very focused on the high-quality customer that Starwood has. SPG, which is what their co-branded card is called, is viewed very positively. You may or may not know when the deal was announced, there was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying, we really love this product. There were a lot of good things said about Amex. I have a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job, as we've been doing, is to provide really, really strong value. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. So that's what we're going to be focused on. On the acquisition side, the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the Loyalty Partner example is a very good one. One, we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have. And what you know in the Loyalty Partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on Loyalty Partner. And so we're in the early stages, as you know, with the Plenti launch. We actually announced, I think it was 2 days ago, that Chili's restaurant chain has come on. And part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's, AT&T, ExxonMobil, Nationwide, a range of companies, is you want to give people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place, redeem somewhere else. And having the different need categories met is very important. So we're very happy to have Chili's in the Plenti program. But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities that obviously, if we feel they're going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities, what we would look, as we looked at with Loyalty Partner, is can we substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that's the philosophy that we're going to take from an acquisition standpoint."

So that's really the main driver there. In terms of 2016 guidance, to be very clear, as we said in the press release, our $5.40 to $5.70 range does not include any potential restructuring charges. I did say, and I would expect, that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in 2016. At this point, while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while, we are not the point where we can estimate those charges, and therefore, give you any sense of them, which is why we didn't feel comfortable trying to build it into any guidance. That said, you might just -- if you look at history, as Ken said earlier, we have, over the last couple of years, done a number of restructurings and those probably give you a reasonable range to think about."

But we did choose to go to absolute levels of EPS because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go to the '15 to '16 to '17 time frame, that it is very difficult, I think, for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates. As I said in my remarks though, if you carefully do the math, you only get to the at least $5.60 in earnings per share that we're targeting in 2017 if you have what I would call a very healthy core growth rate as you move from '16 to '17. In '15 alone, I would point out too, I took people through the math, as you think about the 5% or so of EPS that the co-brand reset cost us which we'll lap, the FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so, which is about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 added as the net gain from the chief Global Business Travel I think for transactions, you end up with a quarter that's growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is of 12% to 15% but showing pretty good growth. And to get to that 2017 number, you're going have to do better than that and get the acceleration and revenue growth that Ken and I talked about. So to try to put a specific number on it gets, I think, very confusing and you start to run together, well, what's part of our $1 billion cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage, and that's just a combination of those things that led us to say, ""Here's just the absolute numbers we think we can get to."""

The drivers are really just what you said. Number one, OptBlue, as we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the break-even point in 2015, and we think we are making great progress in that program. Two, you do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations, as I talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues, right? So in the first half of the year, oddly enough, as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada, that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the Corporate Card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate. And as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically, relative to the U.S., that also cause us -- puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rate from a mix perspective. So it's all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016. And then, Ken, you might want to comment on coverage in OptBlue."

I just reinforce what Jeff said is, is the growing mix of business within the retail and EveryDay sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously, some of the regulation that we're seeing in some of the key international markets. But as we've talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage, which should help our growth. Now, that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that Jeff made, is we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that's going to help. But we consciously understood that with expansion of OptBlue, we were going to have a greater mix of retail and EveryDay, and that's something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our card products."

To answer the question Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results, how they've impacted our view of the future and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing, there are a large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends. 
To start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we have been managing throughout 2015. Versus the prior year, on a reported basis, billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the full year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter but slightly below the full year growth rate, as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.
During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.
Our earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year's EPS of $5.56, which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the Global Business Travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expense.
In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth and expense control all stemmed from actions we took in late 2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving, and all these actions should further help us in 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors. 
First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%, but we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third. Our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015, and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning to lower levels in 2017.
And last. The economic, regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening.
Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 24%. Excluding the Enterprise Growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26%, which is slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business performance by region and segment, which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain segments.
International performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4. I'd note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter, and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. 
GNS remained our fastest growing segment, with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis, powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea and Japan.
In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially at 5%, despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year.
I'll also note that lower gas prices continued to be a drag on USCS growth, as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. 
GCS billed business growth continued to slow, and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment.
Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around midyear.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 5. Loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1. We now expect the sale of the JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1, and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks.
Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since early 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. 
I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused, given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships, which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6. Reported revenues were down for the full year and the quarter, driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter, which is consistent with our full year performance. 
Looking at our major revenue drivers. Discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year, driven in part by the continued rollout of OptBlue.
Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver. Growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, which is modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4%, even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 7. Our provision was down 2% versus the prior year, as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issuers. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics.
Going forward, the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic results.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 8. Total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward, as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results. Marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we've discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. Now obviously, this is a very early signpost for our investments, and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards. Expenses were down 5% in the current quarter, driven by a $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year, during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapsed this as we head into 2016.
One last item I'd highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the Enterprise Growth charge, majority  of which was not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016, excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range it was trending to prior to this quarter. 
While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and in part reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015, as we observed that the environment was evolved.
We have a long track record of taking costs actions when needed. And looking forward, we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions, which we expect will  result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. 
 We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016. And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.
In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans, and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any Amex-accepting merchants through the transaction close date. 
 We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement. And given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimate.
So now that we've concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook.
Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in each year. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year, and the competitive economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook. 
 I now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension. It also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping  fund. This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. 
This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you, though, that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence in executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I'd emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all 4 quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.
On costs. As we moved through 2015 and gain more clarity on the portfolio sale  as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost-reduction  efforts to rightsize  our cost base with the evolving business environment.
As a result, we have launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs by the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective, since 2007, our billed business volumes have grown by over 60% but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period.
We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those actions were no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating costs, which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction.
We plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015, there are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth, which we believe should accelerate from 2015 levels, while with operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second. The portfolio  sale gain will be partially used to fund the continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives.
Last. When the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will fall away immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower-than-anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more costs to offset the lower revenue, which will take some time.
Turning to capital. The portfolio  sale will increase our capital ratios due to a significant reduction in risk-weighted assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities, including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you are aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital requests through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017. We are now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance, there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second, we will have to lap the portfolio  sale gain along with the half year of getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business.
 Third, our more aggressive cost-reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. 
And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficiently. 
Looking beyond 2017. Because there are so many moving pieces in the near term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. I would point out, however, that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate. And overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. 
 We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Ken so he can provide some additional context."

Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our abilit",1202,"Thank you, Jeff. Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term?
To give context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. 
A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we cited last year, including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices, have lasted longer than we previously expected. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years. We've recognized them. We've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency, and we're making progress on many fronts. 
Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive action in the co-brand space. Accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. 
 Now we're set to take cost reduction to the next level through our $1 billion improvement program. We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we're now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. 
We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results. Adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year. We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year. With our OptBlue program, we're continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. 
We grew our lending business faster than the market while maintaining our industry-best credit performance. We'll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. 
We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure, creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we have returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year. 
Although 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear. We need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes 3 priorities: accelerate revenue growth, reduce our expense base and optimize our investments and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. 
Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step-up from there. It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. 
This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the company starting in the first quarter of this year. I've assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri, to lead the effort. He'll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He's been at the forefront of containing our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track record of making the organizations he's led more efficient and more effective.
As this new effort advances, we'll be taking actions to reduce costs in a thoughtful way without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting our reengineering commitments, and I'm confident we'll do it again. 
At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing our investments. We'll continue to use big data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities. We'll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we'll stop certain initiatives where we're not seeing results or a clear path to results, just as we did by refocusing Enterprise  Growth, using our investment dollars more efficiently should help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017.
As we work to accelerate revenues, we'll be focused on the opportunities I cited earlier. We'll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business and develop newer, adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business.
In addition to organic growth, we'll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year, and we're confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon: our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service and our proven ability to innovate. 
Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage, and it's one reason why other card issuers are trying to cobble together a closed loop of their own, despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments. We're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the boundaries between online and off-line blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the convergence of payments and commerce. 
 We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years, and our company has always emerged stronger.  You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anre Williams and Doug Buckminster, as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10.
Let me conclude by saying we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined: to increase revenues, reduce cost and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges: return to growth and position the company for long-term success. Thank you."

I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we're in. And as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see.  If you go back to our Investor Day at March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way. Well, we have those answers now. And when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we're in, we've concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base.

And that's one of the reasons, Don, that we initiated 2 separate restructuring initiatives in 2014, which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out. And I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target, again, flat in 2015. Then in February, as we talked about, we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap, and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge. We know what the situation is now. But that also would be based in part on the revenue and volume growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth has not accelerated as we would have expected. And so we're working to rightsize the cost base. There are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition. But I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we've put in place and we can do it in a way that's not going to impair our ability, very importantly, to build on the range of growth opportunities that we've identified."

We also have a very good small business franchise. International, as we've said, is performing well for us. And certainly, what we are benefiting from is to have a variety of card growth initiatives. So very frankly, it is really across the board that we're seeing this card acquisition growth. And certainly, the point that we have emphasized, it's one thing to get the cards, and we're excited and we think we're getting the right types of cards, but we also have a demonstrated track record of, in fact, generating spending on those cards. And that's very important. But what I would say, the headline would be that we feel very good about the growth that we're seeing across the franchise."

As you think about the course of 2015, we clearly did have an expectation that you would see a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues. As we went through the year, that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that, Sanjay, in the context of our forward outlook, at some point, when revenues weaken  a little bit, as you know, we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times. As we got to the end of the year, though, and looked at a full year of revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn't make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would have had to pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and '17, and so we've adjusted course. I think there's many, many drivers of that slower revenue growth, which Ken and I tried to get it in our remarks. But, Ken, you probably want to provide a little broader context."

I think what's important is while certainly, Sanjay,  the revenues and the volumes are not where we want them to be, I would just go back. If we look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers, we are at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment, and as we continue to maintain over the last several years, an intensifying competitive environment. What we've seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they're making and the billings growth, they're not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better. I'd like it, in fact, to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think, again, the investments that we've made in card acquisitions have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations. Now, we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives, and we're allocating those dollars where we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we've said, when some of those initiatives are not working, Enterprise Growth was an example of that, what I've also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some lead time, as we talked about, between when we're making  investments and when we see the returns. But I think it's not just the signpost that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the signposts that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing, something like Pay with Points, which we are seeing from a standpoint of young people. There is an attraction and engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships, I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets. So I think that's the balance."

Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against the backdrop of an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains. So my real question's concerning the competitive backdrop and change in how your competitors are looking at their economics. How can you maintain the model long term that has traditionally allowed Amex to be valued at a premium to competitors?"

I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend-centric versus the lend-centric, I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results. And certainly, we've said this in the past. If you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues, that range is around 15% to 20%. In the fourth quarter, it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending, and I should add to that, growing better than the industry with industry-leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend-centric model. The second thing that I would say is that there is a danger of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on 1 geography in the U.S. So what's interesting is when you look at small business, and I think you know this, in '14 -- 2014, $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses but only 10% of that was on plastic. And we're -- we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with. In this case, we're competing against cash and checks. And the fact that only 10% of $4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity. I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low, and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rates. So 12% in billings growth, in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer, small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks, that gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit, that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge. But we are not overly dependent on co-brands, and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing. On the merchant side, let's be very clear, Visa and MasterCard have different models. At this point in time, those models are working pretty well for them. But as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there's a sea change going on in payments and commerce. So certainly, they provide an important part of the payments process. But I think increasingly, it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants. And we think direct relationships and the insights, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and off-line commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation, we think, to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that, that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide, and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business, but I do want to avoid to have  apples-to-orange -- oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated, and that varies significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that, as you know, cardmember spending is 3 to 4x the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in many cases, and that obviously is a dynamic there. But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with the end-user  customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you've got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull."

What we're talking about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the market and promotional area, and the operating expense area, when we look at our evolving digital acquisition, our evolving use of big data, when we look at certain markets, Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model where, in fact, we're increasingly finding the use of direct sales forces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts, we absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues. And so as we think about taking the $1 billion out of the cost base, we very consciously have said, while the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses, there are instances where, in fact, it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility to do the right things to drive revenue growth going forward."

Even though that adds to OpEx, that is a very, very good trade-off that we want to make. But I'd just come back on the rewards point because there are different categories of rewards, there is Cashback, there's  co-brands. And the reality is if you look at how we've managed the cost, for example, of membership rewards, I think we've been able to manage those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on Membership Rewards, it's been very strong. So I mentioned that, that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to Pay with Points. And so the deals we've done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that's over 20 years old. And in fact, we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think, as with other categories, when you look at rewards, you've got a segment and you've got to look at the economics of Cashback, you've got to look at co-brands as we talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we've continued to evolve, we've made more digital, we've made more mobile, I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward needs of our customers."

And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to about $4.89. That would imply a negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16. And they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to, the modestly positive EPS growth. I think consensus is at plus 2%. Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that just so there's not, I guess, speculation around what -- how much of '16 is being influenced by -- or I guess, inflated by the gain?"

We are -- we'll use the gain partially to remain at the more elevated level of growth-oriented spending that we were at in 2015 and that, in fact, Moshe was just talking to us about in terms of how we will rationally pull it down in 2017. That is a change. If I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had been we would begin to moderate that growth-oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in, as we've looked at all the things going on in the company, we've made the decision that the right thing to do for the long term is to stay at that higher level. Now, in terms of the exact amount, I guess, there's a little bit of judgment, Bill, involved in that. Certainly, a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level. Is it all the gain? Probably not. Is it the majority of the gain? Probably. I'm not going to put a firm number on it because that's not quite -- that's really not reflective of how we run the company. We look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense to use our shareholders' money on for the long term. We're funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain."

And where we see growth opportunities -- and those of you who have followed the company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa and MasterCard private action. And so the damages claim was in -- I think the first amount tranche was probably $1 billion. I think it was $3 billion in total. I can't remember it exactly. But the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business. Middle market was an example and small business. And I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very, very productive way. So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new cardmembers, deepening customer relationships from a lending and rewards standpoint, we believe, even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015, we see that as an area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that.

We don't think are getting -- we're getting our fair share of lend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity. I think that private label, you've got to think through the different cycles. And as we look at the different cycles in private lending -- in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy. I would just say, to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall, that I would emphasize and I think it's certainly one of the reasons why  Marriott made the deal is they were very, very focused on the high-quality customer that Starwood has. SPG, which is what their co-branded card is called, is viewed very positively. You may or may not know when the deal was announced, there was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying, we really love this product. There were a lot of good things said about Amex. I have a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job, as we've been doing, is to provide really, really strong value. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. So that's what we're going to be focused on. On the acquisition side, the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the Loyalty Partner example is a very good one. One, we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have. And what you know in the Loyalty Partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on Loyalty Partner. And so we're in the early stages, as you know, with the Plenti launch. We actually announced, I think it was 2 days ago, that Chili's restaurant chain has come on. And part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's, AT&T, ExxonMobil, Nationwide, a range of companies, is you want to give people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place, redeem somewhere else. And having the different need categories met is very important. So we're very happy to have Chili's in the Plenti program. But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities that obviously, if we feel they're going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities, what we would look, as we looked at with Loyalty Partner, is can we substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that's the philosophy that we're going to take from an acquisition standpoint."

I did say, and I would expect, that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in 2016. At this point, while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while, we are not at a point where we can estimate those charges, and therefore, give you any sense of them, which is why we didn't feel comfortable trying to build it into any guidance. That said, you might just -- if you look at history, as Ken said earlier, we have, over the last couple of years, done a number of restructurings and those probably give you a reasonable range to think about."

But we did choose to go to absolute levels of EPS because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go to the '15 to '16 to '17 time frame, that it is very difficult, I think, for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates. As I said in my remarks though, if you carefully do the math, you only get to the at least $5.60 in earnings per share that we're targeting in 2017 if you have what I would call a very healthy core growth rate as you move from '16 to '17. In '15 alone, I would point out to you, I took people through the math, as you think about the 5% or so of EPS that the co-brand reset cost us which we'll lap, the FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so, which is about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 added as the net gain from the chief Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, you end up with a core that's growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is of 12% to 15% but showing pretty good growth. And to get to that 2017 number, you're going to have to do better than that and get the acceleration in revenue growth that Ken and I talked about. So to try to put a specific number on it gets, I think, very confusing and you start to run together, well, what's part of our $1 billion cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage, and that's just a combination of those things that led us to say, ""Here's  just the absolute numbers we think we can get to."""

The drivers are really just what you said. Number one, OptBlue, as we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the break-even point in 2015, and we think we are making great progress in that program. Two, you do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations, as I talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues, right? So in the first half of the year, oddly enough, as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada, that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the Corporate Card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate. And as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically, relative to the U.S., that also cause us -- puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rate from a mix perspective. So it's all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016. And then, Ken, you might want to comment on coverage in OptBlue."

I just reinforce what Jeff said is, is the growing mix of business within the retail and EveryDay sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously, some of the regulation that we're seeing in some of the key international markets. But as we've talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage, which should help our growth. Now, that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that Jeff made, is we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that's going to help.

I don't have any information from  them there, but I do know in some of what I have read publicly, they have talked about their excitement about having this type of customer and the value that they put on it. And so that would be my perspective."

Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we provided just last month at Investor Day.

Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we provided just last month at Investor Day. As a reminder, we closed our presentation at Investor Day by highlighting our focus on accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In addition, I made some specific remarks about Q1, including updates on volume trends and several significant quarterly items, such as the close of the JetBlue portfolio sale, the modest restructuring charge, all of which came in about as we expected, and all of which I will describe in more detail later in my remarks.
Earnings per share was $1.45 during the quarter, which included a $0.05 impact for the restructuring charge, $127 million pretax gain from the sale of the JetBlue co-brand portfolio, higher revenues and the elevated investment looks.
We did see an increase in FX-adjusted billed business growth from 5% during the fourth quarter to 6% in Q1, although there were a number of items that influenced first quarter performance, including a benefit from the year and a drop-off in Costco related billings as we move closer to the end of the relationship. As expected, we also saw a larger-than-usual year-over-year decline in our reported discount rate and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar.
The results also reflected healthy underlying loan growth, excellent credit performance and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders.
Stepping back from the quarterly results. We believe that our outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70 and for full year 2017 earnings per share to be at least $5.60 remains appropriate. This outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges for other contingencies.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that relative to Q1, we will see higher earnings per share during Q2 due [ph] to the portfolio sale gain and then lower earnings during the second half of the year as our relationship with Costco ends and we continue to invest at elevated levels.
As we discussed first on the Q4 earnings call and then highlighted again at Investor Day, there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have a much clearer view of the impact at the end of the Costco relationship as we progress through the year.
Before moving on to slides, I did want to highlight several changes to our earnings material this quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have changed our segment reporting to reflect the organizational changes we made late last year. In addition, to help streamline the financial information we release each quarter, we have consolidated the information included what we call the earnings supplement into a single set of earnings tables and slides. We believe this will make it easier to digest the information while not reducing the overall level of information we provide.
Moving now to the slide presentation and begin with a summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% during Q1, which is up from 2% growth last quarter. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth also accelerated modestly to 6% during the quarter from 5% in Q4. Revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year and continued to be impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, although the drag from FX was somewhat smaller than in prior periods. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue growth was 4%, which was relatively consistent with our performance in recent periods. Net income was down 6% versus the prior year as higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain were more than offset by a higher level of investment spending and the modest restructuring charge. We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 69 million shares, which reduced our average share count by 6%.
While the absolute dollar amount of share repurchases we did in Q1 was similar to prior periods, the number of shares we bought back was greater given our lower share price. The decline in shares outstanding along with our net income were earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter, which was 2% below the prior year. 
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.05 restructuring, charge was $1.50. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 to 24%. 
Let's now go through the component of results beginning with billed business on Slide 3. Overall, worldwide FX adjusted billings growth increased slightly this quarter to 6%, reflecting a benefit from leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by a larger year-over-year decline in Costco-related volumes in the U.S. as we move closer to the end of the relationship during June.
To give you a better sense of the underlying trends in core business, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes in all merchants and non-cobrand volumes in Costco on Slide 4. While Costco U.S.-related volumes were growing a bit faster than total company volumes at the end of 2014, they were down 16% versus the prior year in Q1 of 2016, which decreased worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth by more than 200 basis points. So taking this into account, billed business, adjusted for both FX and Costco-related volumes, increased by 8% versus the prior year during Q1, which was up from 7% in Q4.
Now a portion of the increased billings growth had been driven by our efforts to capture the spend activity of current Costco co-brand card members. The landscape will change while Citi launches its new Costco co-brand card in June, but we will remain focused on the spend and lend activity of these customers as the environment evolves.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our billing results by the new reporting segments. As a reminder, our small business results are now included in the Global Commercial Services segment or GCS, and our global network business is now included within our International Consumer and Network Services segment or ICNS. The decline in Costco U.S.-related volumes that I just discussed has the most significant impact on the U.S. consumer volume growth rate, but it also impacts small business volumes within GCS. Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remained headwinds for both the GCS and U.S. consumer segments where they had a more modest impact this quarter.
We continue, as Steve Squeri discussed at Investor Day, to see differing performance trends within GCS with better growth amongst small and middle-market businesses versus more cautious spending amongst the global and large customers. 
Volume growth remained fastest within the ICNS segment, driven by strong GNS growth and the lapping of the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This lapping also drove the sequential improvement in LACC regional volume growth seen on Slide 6.
Looking at billings performance across the other international regions. Volume growth remains strongest in JAPA where billed business increased by 13% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year. The strong growth was powered by significant year-over-year increases in Japan as well as China and Korea. Though I'd remind you that there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within China and Korea.
FX-adjusted EMEA volume growth was relatively consistent versus the prior quarter at 8%, with continued strong performance in the U.K., the growth rates remained in the low double digits.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 7. On the left, you can see that our GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 '15. This decline reflects the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held-for-sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. 
To understand the underlying trends, on the right side of Slide 7, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios and adjusted for FX. This shows a modest sequential acceleration in worldwide loan growth to 11%. And as we disclosed in our regular monthly credit stats 8-K last week, adjusted U.S. cardmember loans were up 12% versus the prior year, which continues to outpace the industry.
We've also provided a split of the balances between cardmember loans and other loans at the bottom of Slide 7. Today, the majority of other loans relates to our merchant financing products. While it makes up a relatively small percentage of the total, other loan had been growing more quickly recently. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we believe that there are attractive opportunities to grow in this space going forward.
Stepping back from the quarter's results. We are pleased with the steady acceleration in underlying loan growth we have demonstrated for several years. As you know, the majority of our loans relate to our U.S. card business, where growth has consistently outpaced the industry over the past several years. Industry growth rates have improved in recent years as well, which clearly has also driven a part of our recent acceleration. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were up 2% and grew by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco-related revenues and a larger-than-usual decline in the reported discount rate. I'll provide some additional detail on the drivers of discount revenue performance and the impact from Costco in just a few minutes.
First though, looking at the other revenue drivers in the quarter. Net interest income grew by 9% given our continued strong loan growth. We also saw an uptick in card fees, which increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was due primarily to growth in fees from our U.S. Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, all of which goes to the strength of these value propositions.
To now expand on the drivers of our discount revenue performance, we told you at our Investor Day that we will begin to provide some additional information, which you see on Slide 9. The top line in the chart shows the trend in our reported discount rate, which to remind you, provides insight to our pricing at point-of-sale with merchants. The bottom line in the chart shows our calculated discount rate, which is the rate you would derive if you divided the discount revenue that we report on the P&L by total billed business. This includes the impact of other items such as growth trends in our network business, cash rebates rewards and incentives we pay to co-brand partners and declines.
During the first quarter, the reported discount rate declined by 5 basis points, consistent with Andre Williams' comments at Investor Day about expecting a larger year-over-year change in the discount rate during the first half this year. In addition to the factors that have traditionally driven declines in our discount rate such as merchant negotiations and mix changes, we are also seeing an impact from the continued expansion of OptBlue as well as the regulatory changes in the EU that were enacted late last year.
As you're aware, expanding merchant coverage is a key priority for us, and we continue to make progress on going our merchant -- growing our merchant footprint this quarter. I'd also remind you that while growth in OptBlue does drive a decline in the discount rate, that impact has been more than offset on the bottom line by the benefits from incremental volumes and lower operating expenses and reduced incentive payments to merchant acquirers.
Looking forward, we expect the reported discount rate to decline by a greater amount in Q1 during the second quarter due to a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals. During the second half of the year, we expect a more modest decline in the discounted rate, as we will no longer have any spending in Costco where we were in a lower-than-average discount rate.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 7 basis points in the quarter, driven in large part by the 5 basis point decrease in the reported discount rate. The 2 basis point gap versus the decline in the reported rate was driven primarily by continued strong growth in cash rebate rewards.
At Investor Day, we also committed to estimating our revenue growth rates, excluding Costco, which we have included on Slide 10. Let me remind you that there is some judgment in this estimation. Based on our analysis, Costco-related revenues were down approximately 11% year-over-year during Q1. As a result, we estimate that our FX-adjusted revenue growth rate, excluding the impact of Costco, improved modestly during the first quarter to approximately 5%. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on achieving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of this year. I would point out that we had an unusual benefit in discount revenue in Q2 '15 that will impact the revenue growth rate next quarter.
Turning to credit performance. Provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, as you can see on the chart on the left side of Slide 11. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios are now recorded through a valuation allowance within operating expenses and are no longer included in provision. When you also exclude those credit costs from the prior year, adjusted provision increased by 12%, as shown on the right side of Slide 11. The growth in adjusted provision was driven by an increase in adjusted loan balances, including the strong growth of our merchant financing products. Card member lending write-off rates were slightly lower year-over-year and remained the lowest amongst large peer issuers.
Consistent with our comments from Investor Day, going forward, we expect that continued growth in loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new cardmembers will both contribute to an increase in provision. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic returns.
So now turning to expenses on Slide 12. Total expenses were up 5% and grew by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This reflected a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and was influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending. In recent years, our marketing and promotion spend was low during the first quarter and then ramped up for the year, beginning in Q2. Going forward, as part of our effort to optimize investments, we intend to spread more evenly the spend across all 4 quarters. We continue to expect that the total full year spending on growth initiatives during 2016 will be consistent with 2015 levels.
As we've discussed, one of the key focus areas for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. issuing businesses during the current quarter and nearly 1 million more from our international issuing businesses, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. These results include new cards from Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for another American Express product, which has been a significant driver of the higher acquisitions in recent quarters. An increasing portion of the new card acquisitions are also coming through digital channel as digital represented almost 2/3 of global consumer acquisitions this quarter.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. The year-over-year change in rewards expense was relatively in line with reported billed business growth. Cost of cardmember services grew by 8% during the quarter, which is significantly lower than its 2015 growth rate, as we have now lapped the reset impact from our new renewed co-brand relationships. 
Operating expenses were up 2% on a reported basis during Q1 '16 but were influenced by a number of items, including the benefit from the JetBlue gain, the restructuring charge, higher investment levels and some specific benefits in the prior year. We continue to have a strong focus on controlling operating expenses and remain focused on reducing our cost base by $1 billion [ph] on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017.
Towards this effort, we did incur the $84 million restructuring charge this quarter and expect to incur additional charges in future quarters, which in aggregate, we expect to be significant as we fully rollout our cost-reduction plans.
Finally, I did want to highlight that we expect operating expenses to be down significantly year-over-year during Q2, as the estimated $1 billion gain from the Costco portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 13. During the quarter, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while maintaining our capital ratios illustrates the strength of our balance sheet and business model. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2016 CCAR process earlier this month. And as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year.
While our 2016 CCAR submission reflected the benefit to our capital ratios from the Costco portfolio of sale, I'd remind you that the submission also reflected a number of other changes versus the prior year, including the loss of Costco-related economics, our reduced earnings outlook from 2016 to 2017 and the more challenging set of economic assumptions in the feds severe scenario.
Our capital plan for the upcoming year will clearly be depended upon the feds view of our capital adequacy, and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance during the quarter was in line with the expectations we outlined at Investor Day. We continue to believe that our earnings per share outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains appropriate. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth and optimize investments, including driving new card acquisitions across our global and consumer portfolios, expanding our merchant footprint and increasing our share of the U.S. card lending.
We also remain focused on controlling our expenses. And the restructuring charge this quarter, reflected the initial phase of actions to take $1 billion out of our cost base by the end of 2017. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focus on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth."

A couple of questions there. So we tried last month at our Investor Day to lay out some level of detail, both our expectations for 2016 and 2017 as well as the really key initiatives that we are focused on, on both the accelerating revenue side as well as the cost side to achieve those results. As I [indiscernible] this afternoon and talked about our first quarter results, as I said in my remarks, I'd say we're tracking with all the -- those initiatives we're focused on and we're tracking with the expectations we laid out. You are correct that we feel good today about our efforts to accelerate growth and we feel good in particular about some of our ability to put other Amex cards into the hands of other co-brand card members. Clearly, in the second half of the year, we will be very focused on maintaining the loyalty of those and other customers. There will be a lot of change in the industry in the back half of the year. That's why I added just a few words of caution about the fact that we think we've taken a very balanced view as we provide you an outlook for the back half. But we'll have to see. It's still very early, but so far so good. In terms of the European Union, you're right, the new interchange caps went into effect in December, early December of last year. To remind everyone, while those don't directly impact American Express, we've set for quite a while now that overall period of time as we, on an ongoing basis, negotiate contracts with merchants, we would expect that to put some downward pressure on our discount rates to some extent. If you think about it, it keeps pressure to keep the differential because we generally have a premium in most of those market somewhat in line with its history. So that impact, you do see reflected in our Q1 results, is one of the reasons that you see an unusual decline in the discount rates by historical standards. It will probably take us a couple of years to work through renegotiating cycle with all the merchants. In terms of the impact on volumes, we feel good about the volume trends in Europe in Q1, and we feel pretty good about them in the U.K. in particular. We are very focused on using all the aspects of our business model and our closed loop to really create and sustain great value propositions for our customers. We think we have a tremendous ability to do that. And the interchange caps create some competitive challenges for others and perhaps some opportunities for us, so we'll have to see how all that plays out over time. But right now we're pleased."

It's not a new trend. It's something we've been doing for a few years. You've seen a modest increase in the differential between us and the industry. But the whole industry, as you know, Craig, has also trended up a little bit this year.

I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hands to when it begins to get used when for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average",411,"Good question, Sanjay. I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hands to when it begins to get used when for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average that will probably cause us to say you're going to see a real meaningful financial impact begin to -- or positive financial impact begin to happen more in the second and third year, probably driven by the fact that historically, the industry have a range of incentives and offers that go with the card acquisition. And the card competitive environment, I would say, that's true now. So one of the factors as you think, Sanjay, and was one of the comments we've made about being very focused on seeing acceleration in our revenue growth adjusting for Costco in the back half of the year is, as we just look at the shear map of our -- the various new cardmembers that we've acquired in recent quarters as they each, through the process I just described, you'll begin to see an uplift as we get into the back half of this year. In terms of my cautionary comments, you're correct. There's nothing more than really me flagging what I think should be everyone, obvious to everyone, which is the size and magnitude of the portfolio of trends where we're about to engage in on the Costco portfolio. But Citi is, I think, pretty unprecedented in the industry. So that just makes us slightly cautious about our own forecasting ability in terms of how consumers will behave because we don't have a perfect precedent for all of the conditions that you see changing in the industry. And it would manifest itself, as you point out, Sanjay, through what behavior Costco co-brand card members who have some other Amex products which they may have had for a long time how their behavior changes as they have new Amex card at Costco. And for that matter, how Amex card members, not Costco co-brand card members, which is other type of Amex card members who traditionally you some portion of their shopping at Costco, how their behavior changes. So all that's factored into our outlook with our what we think is a fairly balanced perspective, the ups and downs. But there's probably a little bit more forecasting here than I would say is usual for us."

They have [indiscernible] because the acquiring landscape, the regulatory landscape varies in every country. But those programs tend to be newer than OptBlue, which we've now been at for a couple of years. That said, we've said from the beginning that it's a multiyear effort to get to where we want to get to with OptBlue. One of the targets we laid out for the first time in Investor Day as you know, Bob, a few weeks ago, was saying we think we can get to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. And I think we're always cautious in saying you have to get to parity coverage in reality first and then you have to also take sometime to let the perception of that coverage also get -- catch up to the reality. So this is a long game we're playing. We are pleased with how it's going in terms of our ability at this point to say we have merchant acquirers who are part of the program, who basically cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S. Not all of those acquirers or a few of the big ones still will be rolling out as we go through the rest of the year. So though it's a long game, we think it's going fine. But the really material impacts take some number of years to really be seen in the financials. In the meantime, the point I was trying to make in my remarks is in the short term, even before perceptions change and perception changing will ultimately help you weather app additions, response rate with overall share wallet, et cetera. But in the near term, you'll clearly get the incremental spend from the incremental merchants you're signing up. There is the lower discount rate impact [indiscernible] every quarter. There is also some savings on the OpEx side because we used to pay some fees to our third-party acquirers we're not paying anymore. When you net those 3 pieces together, ignoring any potential share of wallet or acquisition efficiency benefits, that number turned positive in 2015. It's a very modest number, so it's not a number overall you would note in the financials because remember, coverage is about small merchants who are really important to the perceptions of coverage but in fact, don't drive that many or that bigger percentage of the overall spend dollars. So that's where we are. We feel good about program. We feel good that it's today on the path where it's having a positive impact on the P&L. But the really larger vision and the more material impact is clearly sometime away."

And I think you're probably not surprised to say I'm a little cautious about giving you precise numbers right now for competitive reasons. But let me try to help you and others think a little bit about the magnitude here. We showed a slide, not this quarter but in the last 2 quarters, a little bit -- 2 quarters ago, a little bit of history on card acquisitions. And you're right, these are gross numbers. We don't net out attrition. Attrition hasn't changed a lot over the years. There's some lumpiness in attrition because there are times when we'll embark on a program where we take inactive accounts and terminate them. But attrition materially hasn't changed much in a few years. So that slide 2 quarters ago will give you a little bit of a sense for some of the historical numbers to compare that 2.1 million to. And as I said in my remarks, some good portion of the incremental about the standard run rate, though not all, this driven by the success we've had in putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. When you think about retention, I'd just remind you though a couple of other things we said over the course of the past year. One is that we talked a while back about how, in Canada, where there was no portfolio of sale. At one point last year, we talked about retaining a little over 50% of the out-of-store spend. And when we said that, we were very quick to say and in the U.S., you would expect the number to be significantly lower because there is a portfolio sale. And because we have been and continued to operate under a series of contractual restrictions about how we can market to Costco co-brand card members. And once the sale happens in mid-June, those cardmembers will no longer be known to us that they will be customers, one of our competitors. So that should produce a very different result. Within the box I just tried to for you though, I would say we're pleased with our results thus far. But I will go back a little bit to my response to Sanjay's question and say the real better for the hearts and minds of our customers is still in its early stages, I would say."

Another change though you have seen really over the last couple of years is a little bit of a renewed focus by us on making sure we also have the right lending-oriented products. And I think the launch of the EveryDay card is a good example of that in recent years. Clearly, there's a lot of focus these days on the cashback market and we think our blue Cash card is very competitive and generally lending-oriented card in that space. So we talk a lot about the breadth of our product line, and we really believe in the breadth of our product line because it allows us to have many different kinds of value propositions so we can reach out to many different segments of the marketplace. And I think our efforts around lending, whether it be what we're doing for charge card members to lock or some new products like Everyday or some products that have been around for a little while like blue cash are all manifestations of that strategy of having a very targeted and broad product strategy."

I don't want to make any specific comments about a competitor's product. I would point out, though, that obviously, we were quite engaged in negotiations with Costco ourselves and as with of any co-brand negotiations, you talked a lot about the value proposition as part of the negotiation. So I don't think we were particularly surprised. I made a few other points though, and I'm going to go back actually to something I just said in response to Rick. We really focus on, I think, the strength of our -- the breadth of our product line in a way that allows us to add different we all propositions from different segments of the market. There is not 1 cashback market. There's not 1 rewards market. There's lots of different customer segments, and they value different things. The Citi Costco product will be a good product. That will appeal to a certain demographic, a certain segment. I would point out, sort of a cashback product, you can actually only use it, including our co-brand card, at Costco in terms of the rewards. And if you look at our cashback portfolio, the blue cash product, we feel really good about that value proposition. It has been a real -- one of the real engines of customer acquisition for us. It's got good economics. It is a lend-oriented product to some of my comments really earlier. And it seems to compete very well in the face of the current competitive landscape, which in pure math, probably include some products that are a little richer than the Costco co-brand. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are, and I wouldn't anticipate that there's anything that we've seen in the latest announcements that would cause us to change our current strategies. I also want to come back, David, to your comments about the second half. Maybe I want to be a little careful here and not overplay the forecast uncertainty in the second half. The reason I brought it up is I thought I was stating something fairly obvious, which is that it is an unprecedented change in the industry. We try, are trying very hard to be transparent and balanced in our outlook. And so as we have said for quite some time, the second half, by definition includes a little bit more uncertainty. But there's really nothing to do about our view there. There's nothing new that we've seen in the marketplace that caused us to be any less certain. In fact, with each passing week, we know more than we do the week before."

So in our experience, customers make decisions for many different reasons and value different things. And we really try to focus on both having different products that target what each customer segment most value and try to think about and really leverage the things that we can most uniquely offer. So the strength of our brand is the first thing I think you always have to start with, which is the strength of our brand and its reputation for high-level service and trust. And really taking the side of our customers is something I think is hard for others to match. And we think it's something that allows us to appeal to customers as something that is difficult for a competitor to copy. When you look at the rewards-oriented customer, the breadth and depth and size of our Membership Rewards program allows us to offer a range of ways for people to use what's really an alternative currency in some way. That is very difficult for others to match because they just don't have the size and scale of the program we have. When you look at our closed loop network, you're correct. It allows us to do some things on the offer side, in particular, not only do some things that are merchant funded but also do some things that use our evolving big data capabilities to be very targeted in ways that are difficult for others to match. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry, which is part -- one part of the advantages of our closed loop, very difficult for others to match. So I could go on and should go on to the next question. But the point I'm trying to make is we are all about trying to think about the unique things we can offer to our customer that derives from our unique position as a closed loop global network with great brand and great reach rather than just say, ""This is about mathematically competing on one particular aspect of a cards economics.?"

The answer to the first part is pretty straightforward. Yes. When you look at our coverage today versus that of the 2 dominant networks, it's really, the gap is all about small merchants. For the most part, with very rare exceptions like Costco, which only accepts Amex to date and the medium and large sized merchants generally we deal with directly, and our coverage is pretty much a parity. So it's really all about the small merchants, and that's where we clearly concluded that we need the arms and ways and help the third-party merchant acquirers to reach the many, many, many millions of small merchants where there's a fair amount of charge as well to get them into our network. That's also why, as we just look at the shear map and the fact that we now have a grievance with merchant acquirers who cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S., we feel pretty confident in saying it's a matter of time before they're able to put us into all of those merchants.

And so really the gain were mostly to your point fall to the bottom line in the second quarter. Although I do have just one other important caveat to remind people of, which is we do expect no restructuring charges, including some, hard to quantify right now, in the second quarter. And those would be some incremental offset to the gain as well. And those restructuring charges, just to be crystal-clear, because of our -- the challenge in trying to estimate them, we have as we provided our 5 40 to 5 70 EPS outlook said that excludes all restructuring charges this year.

And so we are not particularly trying to target to use your term, the gamers. And in fact, we work a little bit to specifically not track the gamers. So we feel pretty good, I would say, on balance about the economics of the Blue Cash card. And certainly, one of the things we watch is the overall portfolio of consumer cards that we have in the U.S. over that matter in any market. And so when you look at our card acquisitions, yes, the Blue Cash card has been particular important acquisition engine in recent quarters, but I'd point out to you that's because part of what we're trying to do is put replacement cards in the hands of people who formerly had a Costco co-brand card. And so the blue cash card tends to appeal to that segment of the market. Meanwhile, we've continued our historical acquisition efforts with the Gold, Platinum. The Delta card is going tremendously well. And I think you've heard Delta made some comments about that as well. So we have a range of products, and blue Cash is just one of them, which appeals to a particular segment, is lend-oriented and is producing perfectly fine economics for us. In terms of an overall rewards rate, we don't really look at it that way. Just what I'd say is certainly rewards costs -- the cash rebate rewards costs are growing faster that our company average because those products are growing faster than the company average. And you see me calling that out a little bit in my discussion earlier about the calculated discount rate. There's still a very modest piece of the overall company's cards and economics, so that's one important thing to keep in mind. So I'd say this is all part of our strategy of having the broadest product line and offering lots of different value propositions. We make sure that all of the value propositions are economic for our shareholders while providing good value to customers, and I think the blue Cash card fits right into that theme."

Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we provided just last month at Investor Day.

Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we provided just last month at Investor Day. As a reminder, we closed our presentation at Investor Day by highlighting our focus on accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In addition, I made some specific remarks about Q1, including updates on volume trends and several significant quarterly items such as the close of the JetBlue portfolio sale, the modest restructuring charge, all of which came in about as we expected and all of which I will describe in more detail later in my remarks.
Earnings per share was $1.45 during the quarter, which included a $0.05 impact for the restructuring charge, $127 million pretax gain from the sale of the JetBlue co-brand portfolio, higher revenues and elevated investment levels. 
We did see an increase in FX-adjusted billed business growth from 5% during the fourth quarter to 6% in Q1, though there were a number of items that influenced first quarter performance, including a benefit from the year and a drop-off in Costco-related billings as we move closer to the end of the relationship. As expected, we also saw a larger-than-usual year-over-year decline in our reported discount rate and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar.
The results also reflected healthy underlying loan growth, excellent credit performance and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders.
Stepping back from the quarterly results. We believe that our outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70 and for full year 2017 earnings per share to be at least $5.60 remains appropriate. This outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges for other contingencies.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that relative to Q1, we will see higher earnings per share during Q2 due to the portfolio sale gain and then lower earnings during the second half of the year as our relationship with Costco ends and we continue to invest at elevated levels.
As we discussed first on the Q4 earnings call and then highlighted again at Investor Day, there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have a much clearer view of the impact of the end of the Costco relationship as we progress through the year.
Before moving on to slides, I did want to highlight several changes to our earnings material this quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have changed our segment reporting to reflect the organizational changes we made late last year. In addition, to help streamline the financial information we release each quarter, we have consolidated the information included in what we call the earnings supplement into a single set of earnings tables and slides. We believe this will make it easier to digest the information while not reducing the overall level of information we provide.
To move now to the slide presentation and begin with a summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% during Q1, which is up from 2% growth last quarter. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth also accelerated modestly to 6% during the quarter from 5% in Q4. Revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year and continued to be impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, although the drag from FX was somewhat smaller than in prior periods. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue growth was 4%, which was relatively consistent with our performance in recent periods. Net income was down 6% versus the prior year as higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain were more than offset by a higher level of investment spending and the modest restructuring charge. We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 69 million shares, which reduced our average share count by 6%.
While the absolute dollar amount of share repurchases we did in Q1 was similar to prior periods, the number of shares we bought back was greater given our lower share price. The decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter, which was 2% below the prior year. 
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.05 restructuring charge, was $1.50. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 to 24%. 
Let's now go through the components of results beginning with billed business on Slide 3. Overall, worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth increased slightly this quarter to 6%, reflecting a benefit from leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by a larger year-over-year decline in Costco-related volumes in the U.S. as we move closer to the end of the relationship during June.
To give you a better sense of the underlying trends in the core business, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes in all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 4. 
While Costco U.S.-related volumes were growing a bit faster than total company volumes at the end of 2014, they were down 16% versus the prior year in Q1 of 2016, which decreased worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth by more than 200 basis points. So taking this into account, billed business, adjusted for both FX and Costco-related volumes, increased by 8% versus the prior year during Q1, which was up from 7% in Q4.
Now a portion of the increased billings growth has been driven by our efforts to capture the spend activity of current Costco co-brand card members. The landscape will change once Citi launches its new Costco co-brand card in June, but we will remain focused on the spend and lend activity of these customers as the environment evolves.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our billing results by the new reporting segments. As a reminder, our small business results are now included in the Global Commercial Services segment or GCS, and our Global Network business is now included within our International Consumer and Network Services segment or ICNS. The decline in Costco U.S.-related volumes that I just discussed has the most significant impact on the U.S. consumer volume growth rate, but it also impacts small business volumes within GCS. Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remained headwinds for both the GCS and U.S. Consumer segments, though they had a more modest impact this quarter.
We continue, as Steve Squeri discussed at Investor Day, to see differing performance trends within GCS with better growth amongst small and middle-market businesses versus more cautious spending amongst global and large customers. 
Volume growth remained fastest within the ICNS segment, driven by strong GNS growth and the lapping of the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This lapping also drove the sequential improvement in LACC regional volume growth seen on Slide 6.
Looking at billings performance across the other international regions. Volume growth remained strongest in JAPA where billed business increased by 13% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year. The strong growth was powered by significant year-over-year increases in Japan as well as China and Korea, though I'd remind you that there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within China and Korea.
FX-adjusted EMEA volume growth was relatively consistent versus the prior quarter at 8%. We've continued strong performance in the U.K., where growth rates remained in the low double digits.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 7. On the left, you can see that our GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 '15. This decline reflects the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held for sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. 
To understand the underlying trends, on the right side of Slide 7, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios and adjusted for FX. This shows a modest sequential acceleration in worldwide loan growth to 11%. And as we disclosed in our regular monthly credit stats 8-K last week, adjusted U.S. Card Member loans were up 12% versus the prior year, which continues to outpace the industry.
We've also provided a split of the balances between Card Member loans and other loans at the bottom of Slide 7. Today, the majority of other loans relate to our merchant financing products. While it makes up a relatively small percentage of the total, other loans have been growing more quickly recently. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we believe that there are attractive opportunities to grow in this space going forward.
Stepping back from the quarter's results. We are pleased with the steady acceleration in underlying loan growth we have demonstrated for several years. As you know, the majority of our loans relate to our U.S. card business, where growth has consistently outpaced the industry over the past several years. 
Industry growth rates have improved in recent years as well, which clearly has also driven a part of our recent acceleration. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were up 2% and grew by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco-related revenues and a larger-than-usual decline in the reported discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount revenue performance and the impact from Costco in just a few minutes.
First though, looking at the other revenue drivers in the quarter. Net interest income grew by 9% given our continued strong loan growth. We also saw an uptick in card fees, which increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was due primarily to growth in fees from our U.S. Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, all of which goes to the strength of these value propositions.
To now expand on the drivers of our discount revenue performance. We told you at our Investor Day that we will begin to provide some additional information, which you see on Slide 9. The top line in the chart shows the trend in our reported discount rate, which, to remind you, provides insight to our pricing at point of sale with merchants. The bottom line in the chart shows our calculated discount rate, which is the rate you would derive if you divided the discount revenue that we report on the P&L by total billed business. This includes the impact of other items such as growth trends in our network business, cash rebate rewards and incentives we pay to co-brand partners and to clients.
During the first quarter, the reported discount rate declined by 5 basis points, consistent with Anre Williams' comments at Investor Day about expecting a larger year-over-year change in the discount rate during the first half this year. In addition to the factors that have traditionally driven declines in our discount rate such as merchant negotiations and mix changes, we are also seeing an impact from the continued expansion of OptBlue as well as the regulatory changes in the EU that were enacted late last year.
As you're aware, expanding merchant coverage is a key priority for us, and we continue to make progress on going our merchant -- growing our merchant footprint this quarter. I'd also remind you that while growth in OptBlue does drive a decline in the discount rate, that impact has been more than offset on the bottom line by the benefits from incremental volumes and lower operating expenses from reduced incentive payments to merchant acquirers.
Looking forward, we expect the reported discount rate to decline by a greater amount in Q1 during the second quarter due to a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals. During the second half of the year, we expect a more modest decline in the discount rate as we will no longer have any spending at Costco where we were in a lower-than-average discount rate.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 7 basis points in the quarter, driven in large part by the 5 basis point decrease in the reported discount rate. The 2 basis point gap versus the decline in the reported rate was driven primarily by continued strong growth in cash rebate rewards.
At Investor Day, we also committed to estimating our revenue growth rates, excluding Costco, which we have included on Slide 10. I'd remind you that there is some judgment in this estimation. Based on our analysis, Costco-related revenues were down approximately 11% year-over-year during Q1. As a result, we estimate that our FX-adjusted revenue growth rate, excluding the impact of Costco, improved modestly during the first quarter to approximately 5%. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on achieving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of this year. I would point out that we had an unusual benefit in discount revenue in Q2 '15 that will impact the revenue growth rate next quarter.
Turning to credit performance. Provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, as you can see in the chart on the left side of Slide 11. But this result reflects the impact of the held for sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held for sale portfolios are now recorded through a valuation allowance within operating expenses and are no longer included in provision. When you also exclude those credit costs from the prior year, adjusted provision increased by 12%, as shown on the right side of Slide 11. The growth in adjusted provision was driven by an increase in adjusted loan balances, including the strong growth of our merchant financing products. Card Member lending write-off rates were slightly lower year-over-year and remained the lowest amongst large peer issuers.
Consistent with our comments from Investor Day, going forward, we expect a continued growth in loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members will both contribute to an increase in provision. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic returns.
So now turning to expenses on Slide 12. Total expenses were up 5% and grew by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This reflected a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and was influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending. In recent years, our marketing and promotion spend was low during the first quarter and then ramped up for the year, beginning in Q2. Going forward, as part of our effort to optimize investments, we intend to spread more evenly the spend across all 4 quarters. We continue to expect that the total full year spending on growth initiatives during 2016 will be consistent with 2015 levels.
As we've discussed, one of the key focus areas for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. issuing businesses during the current quarter and nearly 1 million more from our international issuing businesses, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. These results include new cards from Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for another American Express product, which has been a significant driver of the higher acquisitions in recent quarters. An increasing portion of the new card acquisitions are also coming through digital channels as digital represented almost 2/3 of global consumer acquisitions this quarter.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. The year-over-year change in rewards expense was relatively in line with reported billed business growth. Cost of Card Member services grew by 8% during the quarter, which is significantly lower than its 2015 growth rate, as we have now lapped the reset impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. 
Operating expenses were up 2% on a reported basis during Q1 '16 but were influenced by a number of items, including the benefit from the JetBlue gain, the restructuring charge, higher investment levels and some specific benefits in the prior year. We continue to have a strong focus on controlling operating expenses and remain focused on reducing our cost base by $1 billion on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.
Towards this effort, we did incur the $84 million restructuring charge this quarter and expect to incur additional charges in future quarters, which, in aggregate, we expect to be significant as we fully roll out our cost reduction plans.
Finally, I did want to highlight that we expect operating expenses to be down significantly year-over-year during Q2, as the estimated $1 billion gain from the Costco portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 13. During the quarter, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while maintaining our capital ratios illustrates the strength of our balance sheet and business model. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2016 CCAR process earlier this month. And as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year.
While our 2016 CCAR submission reflected the benefit to our capital ratios from the Costco portfolio sale, I'd remind you that the submission also reflected a number of other changes versus the prior year, including the loss of Costco-related economics, our reduced earnings outlook for 2016 to 2017 and the more challenging set of economic assumptions in the Fed's severe scenario.
Our capital plan for the upcoming year will clearly be depended upon the Fed's view of our capital adequacy, and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance during the quarter was in line with the expectations we outlined at Investor Day. We continue to believe that our earnings per share outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains appropriate. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth and optimize investments, including driving new card acquisitions across our global and consumer portfolios, expanding our merchant footprint and increasing our share of the U.S. card lending.
We also remain focused on controlling our expenses, and the restructuring charge this quarter reflected the initial phase of actions to take $1 billion out of our cost base by the end of 2017. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth."

A couple of questions there. So we tried last month at our Investor Day to lay out some level of detail, both our expectations for 2016 and 2017 as well as the really key initiatives that we are focused on, on both the accelerating revenue side as well as the cost side to achieve those results. As I sit here this afternoon and talk about our first quarter results, as I said in my remarks, I'd say we're tracking with all the -- both initiatives we're focused on and we're tracking with the expectations we laid out. You are correct that we feel good today about our efforts to accelerate growth, and we feel good in particular about some of our ability to put other Amex cards into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. Clearly, in the second half of the year, we will be very focused on maintaining the loyalty of those and other customers. There will be a lot of change in the industry in the back half of the year, and that's why I added just a few words of caution about the fact that we think we've taken a very balanced view as we provide you an outlook for the back half. But we'll have to see. It's still very early. But so far, so good. In terms of the European Union, you're right, the new interchange caps went into effect in December, early December of last year. To remind everyone, while those don't directly impact American Express, we've said for quite a while now that over a period of time, as we, on an ongoing basis, negotiate contracts with merchants, we would expect that to put some downward pressure on our discount rates. To some extent, if you think about it, it keeps -- pressure to keep the differential because we generally have a premium in most of those markets somewhat in line with its history. So that impact, you do see reflected in our Q1 results, is one of the reasons that you see an unusual decline in the discount rates by historical standards. It will probably take us a couple of years to work through a negotiating cycle with all the merchants. In terms of the impact on volumes, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe in Q1, and we feel pretty good about them in the U.K., in particular. We are very focused on using all the aspects of our business model and our closed loop to really create and sustain great value propositions for our customers. We think we have a tremendous ability to do that. And the interchange caps create some competitive challenges for others and perhaps some opportunities for us, so we'll have to see how all that plays out over time. But right now, we're pleased."

Thanks for the question, Craig. We do feel good about the last several years. I do want to keep coming back to our performance and our ability to grow our lending book, which is predominantly U.S. consumer, at rates above what you're seeing in the industry is not a new trend. It's something we've been doing for a few years. You've seen a modest increase in the differential between us and the industry. But the whole industry, as you know, Craig, has also trended up a little bit this year. When you look at the composition of the Q1 increases, it's -- as Doug Buckminster talked about at Investor Day, it's about 1/3 coming from existing customers and about 2/3 from new customers. And when you look at the credit profile, we continue to feel really good about our success in achieving these growth rates some time ago, sustaining them and doing it in a way that keeps our average credit, profile quite consistent with our history. So we think there's a lot of reasons we've been able to do this, and there's a lot of reasons we should be able to continue to do it for a long time when you look at the fact that we historically under-index on the portion of our own customers and people who look like our customers borrowing behaviors. And so we think with our renewed focus on having the right products, the right marketing, the right offers out in the marketplace to better attract our fair share of those behaviors, that we have a long runway to continue to achieve the kind of performance you saw in Q1."

I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hands to when it begins to get used when, for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average that would probably cause us to say you're going to see a real meaningful financial impact begin to -- or positive financial impact begin to happen more in the second and third year, partly driven by the fact that, historically, in the industry, you have a range of incentives and offers that go with the card acquisition. In the current competitive environment, I would say that's true now. So one of the factors, as you think, Sanjay, about some of the comments we've made about being very focused on seeing acceleration in our revenue growth, adjusting for Costco in the back half of the year, is -- as we just look at the sheer math of our -- the various new card members that we've acquired in recent quarters as they age through the process I just described, you'll begin to see an uplift as we get into the back half of this year. In terms of my cautionary comments, you're correct. There's nothing more than really me flagging what I think should be everyone -- obvious to everyone, which is the size and magnitude of the portfolio transfer we're about to engage in on the Costco portfolio. But Citi is, I think, pretty unprecedented in the industry. So that just makes us slightly cautious about our own forecasting abilities in terms of how consumers will behave because we don't have a perfect precedent for all of the conditions that you see changing in the industry. And it would manifest itself, as you point out, Sanjay, through what behavior Costco co-brand card members who have some other Amex products, which they may have had for a long time or a short time, how their behavior changes if they can't use the Amex card at Costco and, for that matter, how Amex card members, not Costco co-brand card members, which is other types of Amex card members who traditionally do some portion of their shopping at Costco, how their behavior changes. So all that's factored into our outlook with our -- what we think is a fairly balanced perspective on the ups and downs. But there's probably a little bit more forecasting error than I would say is usual for us."

They have to vary because the acquiring landscape, the regulatory landscape varies in every country. But those programs tend to be newer than OptBlue, which we've now been at for a couple of years. That said, we've said from the beginning that it's a multiyear effort to get to where we want to get to with OptBlue. One of the targets we laid out for the first time in Investor Day, as you know, Bob, a few weeks ago was saying we think we could get to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. And I think we're always cautious in saying you have to get to parity coverage in reality first and then you have to also take some time to let the perception of that coverage also get -- catch up to the reality. So this is a long game we're playing. We are pleased with how it's going in terms of our ability at this point to say we have merchant acquirers who are part of the program, who basically cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S. Not all of those acquirers or a few of the big ones still will be rolling out as we go through the rest of the year. So though it's a long game, we think it's going fine, but the really material impacts take some number of years to really be seen in the financials. In the meantime, the point I was trying to make in my remarks is in the short term, even before perceptions change and perceptions changing will ultimately help you with acquisition response rate with overall share wallet, et cetera. But in the near term, you clearly get the incremental spend from the incremental merchants you're signing up. There is the lower discount rate impact fee every quarter. There's also some savings on the OpEx side because we used to pay some fees to our third-party acquirers. We're not paying anymore. When you net those 3 pieces together, ignoring any potential share of wallet or acquisition efficiency benefits, that number turned positive in 2015. It's a very modest number, so it's not a number overall you would note in the financials because, remember, coverage is about small merchants who are really important to the perceptions of coverage but, in fact, don't drive that many or that bigger percentage of the overall spend dollars. So that's where we are. We feel good about the program. We feel good that it's today on a path where it's having a positive impact on the P&L. But the really larger vision and more material impact is clearly sometime away."

And I think you're probably not surprised to say I'm a little cautious about giving you precise numbers right now for competitive reasons. But let me try to help you and others think a little bit about the magnitude here. We showed a slide, not this quarter but in the last 2 quarters, a little bit -- 2 quarters ago, a little bit of history on card acquisitions. And you're right, these are gross numbers. We don't net out attrition. Attrition hasn't changed a lot the last couple of years. There's some lumpiness in attrition because there are times when we'll embark on a program where we take inactive accounts and terminate them. But attrition materially hasn't changed much in a few years. So that slide 2 quarters ago will give you a little bit of a sense for some of the historical numbers to compare that 2.1 million to. And as I said in my remarks, some good portion of the increment above the standard run rate, though not all, is driven by the success we've had in putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. When you think about retention, I'd just remind you though of a couple of other things we've said over the course of the past year. One is that we talked a while back about how, in Canada, where there was no portfolio sale. At one point last year, we talked about retaining a little over 50% of the out-of-store spend. And when we said that, we were very quick to say -- and in the U.S., you would expect the number to be significantly lower because there is a portfolio sale and because we have been and continue to operate under a series of contractual restrictions about how we can market to Costco co-brand card members. And once the sale happens in mid-June, those card members will no longer be known to us that they will be customers of one of our competitors. So that should produce a very different result. Within the box I just tried to paint for you though, I would say we're pleased with our results thus far. But I will go back a little bit to my response to Sanjay's question and say the real battle for the hearts and minds of our customers is still in its early stages, I would say."

That would not count as a new card, but it is one of the things -- one of the many things we're doing to help drive a little higher growth in our loan balances. I think it is important to point out though, Rick, another change though you have seen really over the last couple of years is a little bit of a renewed focus by us on making sure we also have the right lending-oriented products. And I think the launch of the EveryDay card is a good example of that in recent years. Clearly, there's a lot of focus these days on the Cashback market, and we think our Blue Cash Card is a very competitive and generally lending-oriented card in that space. So we talk a lot about the breadth of our product line. And we really believe in the breadth of our product line because it allows us to have many different kinds of value propositions so we can reach out to many different segments of the marketplace. And I think our efforts around lending, whether it be what we're doing for charge card members through LOC or some new products like EveryDay or some products that have been around for a little while like Blue Cash are all manifestations of that strategy of having a very targeted and broad product strategy."

And as part of any co-brand negotiations, you talk a lot about the value proposition as part of a negotiation. So I don't think we were particularly surprised. I' d make I a few other points though, and I'm going to go back actually to something I just said in response to Rick, we really focus on and I think a strength of ours is the breadth of our product line and the way that allows us to add different value propositions for different segments of the market. There is not 1 cashback market. There's not 1 rewards market. There's lots of different customer segments, and they value different things. The Citi Costco product will be a good product that will appeal to a certain demographic, a certain segment. I would point out, sort of a cashback product, you can actually only use it, including our co-brand card, at Costco in terms of the rewards. And if you look at our cashback portfolio, the Blue Cash product, we feel really good about that value proposition. It has been a real -- one of the real engines of customer acquisition for us. It's got good economics. It is a lend-oriented product to some of my comments earlier. And it seems to compete very well in the face of the current competitive landscape, which, in pure math, probably includes some products that are a little richer than the Costco co-brand. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are, and I wouldn't anticipate that there's anything that we've seen in the latest announcements that will cause us to change our current strategies. I also want to come back, David, to your comments about the second half. Maybe I want to be a little careful here and not overplay the forecast uncertainty in the second half. Though the reason I brought it up is I thought I was stating something fairly obvious, which is that it is an unprecedented change in the industry. We try -- are trying very hard to be transparent and balanced in our outlook. And so as we have said for quite some time, the second half, by definition, includes a little bit more uncertainty. But there's really nothing new about our view there. There's nothing new that we've seen in the marketplace that caused us to be any less certain. In fact, with each passing week, we know more than we do the week before."

And we really try to focus on both having different products that target what each customer segment most values and trying to think about and really leverage the things that we can most uniquely offer. So the strength of our brand is the first thing I think you always have to start with, which is the strength of our brand and its reputation for high-level service and trust. And really taking the side of our customers is something that I think is hard for others to match and we think is something that allows us to appeal to customers as something that is difficult for a competitor to copy. When you look at the rewards-oriented customer, the breadth and depth and size of our Membership Rewards program allows us to offer a range of ways for people to use what's really an alternative currency in some way. That is very difficult for others to match because they just don't have the size and scale of the program we have. When you look at our closed loop network, you're correct, it allows us to do some things on the offer side, in particular, not only do some things that are merchant-funded but also do some things that use our evolving big data capabilities to be very targeted in ways that are difficult for others to match. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry, which is part -- one part of the advantages of our closed loop, very difficult for others to match. So I could go on and we should -- I'll go on to the next question. But the point I'm trying to make is we are all about trying to think about the unique things we can offer to a customer that derive from our unique position as a closed loop global network with a great brand and great reach rather than just say, ""This is about mathematically competing on one particular aspect of a cards economics."

You could have an interesting discussion about customer behavior. So it's an extra day in a month, but it's probably somewhere around 1%. You have other year-over-year factors as you think about the quarter as well. I would point out, you have lower gas prices or particularly T&E-oriented, probably more than most. So lower airline ticket prices in my old industry probably impact us as well. When you think about Costco, as I said in my remarks, when you look at the incremental cards we're acquiring, a significant portion of the increment is driven by those efforts to put other Amex products in the hands of Costco co-brand card members. I don't want to be more specific for competitive reasons beyond that. What I would say is that's also part of what drives our statement, as I said earlier, that we'd expect as you get into the back half of this year and next year, a little bit further uptick in the financial metrics. Because as we put those cards in the hands of people, it does take some time before you really see a meaningful financial impact. You've got to put the card in people's hands. They slowly start to build spend, then it takes a while to build, et cetera. So those are probably the added comments I would make about our Q1 metrics, Moshe."

The answer to the first part is pretty straightforward. Yes. When you look at our coverage today versus that of the 2 dominant networks, it's really the gap is all about small merchants. For the most part, with very rare exceptions like Costco, which only accepts Amex today, medium- and large-size merchants, generally, we deal with directly, and our coverage is pretty much a parity. So it's really all about the small merchants, and that's where we clearly concluded that we need the arms and legs and help of the third-party merchant acquirers to reach the many, many, many millions of small merchants, where there's a fair amount of churn as well to get them into our network. That's also why, as we just look at the sheer math and the fact that we now have agreements with merchant acquirers who cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S., we feel pretty confident in saying it's a matter of time before they're able to put us into all of those merchants. So that's the logic behind OptBlue and how the small merchants fit in with the medium to large merchants. So the question is, are we learning anything in OptBlue that would cause us to change our view about the direct connections we have with the larger merchants? I would say the answer -- short answer is no. We really value those connections. I think the merchants value them. We are able because of the closed loop disclosed at some of the comment I made earlier. We think to bring some value to those relationships that are not always easy for others to match, and so we very much want to keep those connections."

So, yes, we expect the Costco gain to come in, in June approximately $1 billion. Unlike previous years, we are spreading across evenly throughout the year our investment or growth-oriented spend. The biggest chunk of which appears in marketing and promotion. So to be very granular, that means that if you just look at our marketing and promotional line for all of 2016, you should expect it to look about like it did in 2015. And in fact, you just saw us in Q1 raise Q1 closer to an average level that you will see across the next 3 quarters. So that's what you'll see on the marketing and promotional line. And so, really, the gain will, mostly to your point, fall to the bottom line in the second quarter. Although I do think there's one other important caveat to remind people of, which is we do expect more restructuring charges, including some, hard to quantify right now, in the second quarter. And those would be some incremental offset to the gain as well. And those restructuring charges, just to be crystal clear, because of our -- the challenge in trying to estimate them, we have, as we provided our $5.40 to $5.70 EPS outlook, said that excludes all restructuring charges this year.

[Audio Gap] 
when you're talking about a $300 million, let's pick a midpoint, decrease that says maybe you're coming down 10% next year, which also implies that you're sort of elevated 10% this year. So it's an important increment in light of the goal we have around the spend and lend of the Costco co-brand card members. It's an important percentage in terms of the competitive environment. But I think sometimes, people overplay just how big that increment is as we get ever more efficient with our acquisition efforts every year. And I made the point that 2/3 of our consumer acquisitions in Q1 were digital. It's those kinds of statistics, Bill, that give us confidence that we can continue to edge that number down without seeing a significant impact on our acquisition efforts."

And the reason I'm asking is because it seems like it has the potential to be maybe the most expensive product you have as customers look to optimize them. Just kind of looking at the current offer, and it's 0% on balances for the first 12 months, 10% cash back on wireless phone service, 6% on supermarket spend and 3% on gas.

And so we are not particularly trying to target to use your term, the gamers. And in fact, we'll work a little bit to specifically not attract the gamers. So we feel pretty good, I would say, on balance about the economics of the Blue Cash Card. And certainly, one of the things we watch is the overall portfolio of consumer cards that we have in the U.S. over that matter in any market. And so when you look at our card acquisitions, yes, the Blue Cash Card has been a particular important acquisition engine in recent quarters, but I'd point out to you that's because part of what we're trying to do is put replacement cards in the hands of people who formerly had a Costco co-brand card. And so the Blue Cash Card tends to appeal to that segment of the market. Meanwhile, we've continued our historical acquisition efforts with Gold, the Platinum. The Delta card is going tremendously well. And I think you've heard Delta made some comments about that as well. So we have a range of products, and Blue Cash is just one of them, which appeals to a particular segment, is lend-oriented and is producing perfectly fine economics for us. In terms of an overall rewards rate, we don't really look at it that way. I guess what I'd say is, certainly, rewards costs -- the cash rebate rewards costs are growing faster than our company average because those products are growing faster than the company average. And you see me calling that out a little bit in my discussion earlier about the calculated discount rate. There's still a very modest piece of the overall company's cards and economics, so it's one important thing to keep in mind. So, look, I'd say this is all part of our strategy of having the broadest product line and offering lots of different value propositions. We make sure that all of the value propositions are economic for our shareholders while providing good value to customers, and I think the Blue Cash Card fits right into that vein."

Earnings per share was $1.45 during the quarter, which included a $0.05 impact for the restructuring charge, $127 million pretax gain from the sale of the JetBlue co-brand portfolio, higher revenues and elevated investment levels. 
We did see an increase in FX-adjusted billed business growth from 5% during the fourth quarter to 6% in Q1, though there were a number of items that influenced first quarter performance, including a benefit from the year and a drop-off in Costco-related billings as we move closer to the end of their relationship. As expected, we also saw a larger-than-usual year-over-year decline in our reported discount rate and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar.
The results also reflected healthy underlying loan growth, excellent credit performance and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders.
Stepping back from the quarterly results. We believe that our outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70 and for full year 2017 earnings per share to be at least $5.60 remains appropriate. This outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges for other contingencies.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that relative to Q1, we will see higher earnings per share during Q2 due to the portfolio sale gain and then lower earnings during the second half of the year as our relationship with Costco ends and we continue to invest at elevated levels.
As we discussed first on the Q4 earnings call and then highlighted again at Investor Day, there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have a much clearer view of the impact of the end of the Costco relationship as we progress through the year.
Before moving on to slides, I did want to highlight several changes to our earnings material this quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have changed our segment reporting to reflect the organizational changes we made late last year. In addition, to help streamline the financial information we release each quarter, we have consolidated the information included what we call the earnings supplement into a single set of earnings tables and slides. We believe this will make it easier to digest the information while not reducing the overall level of information we provide.
To move now to the slide presentation and begin with a summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% during Q1, which is up from 2% growth last quarter. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth also accelerated modestly to 6% during the quarter from 5% in Q4. Revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year and continued to be impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, although the drag from FX was somewhat smaller than in prior periods. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue growth was 4%, which was relatively consistent with our performance in recent periods. Net income was down 6% versus the prior year as higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain were more than offset by a higher level of investment spending and the modest restructuring charge. We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 69 million shares, which reduced our average share count by 6%.
While the absolute dollar amount of share repurchases we did in Q1 was similar to prior periods, the number of shares we bought back was greater given our lower share price. The decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter, which was 2% below the prior year. 
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.05 restructuring charge, was $1.50. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 to 24%. 
Let's now go through the components of results beginning with billed business on Slide 3. Overall, worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth increased slightly this quarter to 6%, reflecting a benefit from leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by a larger year-over-year decline in Costco-related volumes in the U.S. as we move closer to the end of the relationship during June.
To give you a better sense of the underlying trends in the core business, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes in all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 4. 
While Costco U.S.-related volumes were growing a bit faster than total company volumes at the end of 2014, they were down 16% versus the prior year in Q1 of 2016, which decreased worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth by more than 200 basis points. So taking this into account, billed business, adjusted for both FX and Costco-related volumes, increased by 8% versus the prior year during Q1, which was up from 7% in Q4.
Now a portion of the increased billings growth has been driven by our efforts to capture the spend activity of current Costco co-branded card members. The landscape will change once Citi launches its new Costco co-brand card in June, but we will remain focused on the spend and lend activity of these customers as the environment evolves.
Turning to Slide 5, which shows our billing results by the new reporting segments. As a reminder, our small business results are now included in the Global Commercial Services segment or GCS, and our Global Network business is now included within our International Consumer and Network Services segment or ICNS. The decline in Costco U.S.-related volumes that I just discussed has the most significant impact on the U.S. consumer volume growth rate, but it also impacts small business volumes within GCS. Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remained headwinds for both the GCS and U.S. Consumer segments, though they had a more modest impact this quarter.
We continue, as Steve Squeri discussed at Investor Day, to see differing performance trends within GCS with better growth amongst small and middle-market businesses versus more cautious spending amongst global and large customers. 
Volume growth remained fastest within the ICNS segment, driven by strong GNS growth and the lapping of the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This lapping also drove the sequential improvement in LACC regional volume growth seen on Slide 6.
Looking at billings performance across the other international regions. Volume growth remained strongest in JAPA where billed business increased by 13% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year. The strong growth was powered by significant year-over-year increases in Japan as well as China and Korea, though I'd remind you that there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within China and Korea.
FX-adjusted EMEA volume growth was relatively consistent versus the prior quarter at 8%. We've continued strong performance in the U.K., where growth rates remained in the low double digits.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 7. On the left, you can see that our GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 '15. This decline reflects the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held for sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. 
To understand the underlying trends, on the right side of Slide 7, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios and adjusted for FX. This shows a modest sequential acceleration in worldwide loan growth to 11%. And as we disclosed in our regular monthly credit stats 8-K last week, adjusted U.S. Card Member loans were up 12% versus the prior year, which continues to outpace the industry.
We've also provided a split of the balances between Card Member loans and other loans at the bottom of Slide 7. Today, the majority of other loans relate to our merchant financing products. While it makes up a relatively small percentage of the total, other loans have been growing more quickly recently. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we believe that there are attractive opportunities to grow in this space going forward.
Stepping back from the quarter's results. We are pleased with the steady acceleration in underlying loan growth we have demonstrated for several years. As you know, the majority of our loans relate to our U.S. card business, where growth has consistently outpaced the industry over the past several years. 
Industry growth rates have improved in recent years as well, which clearly has also driven a part of our recent acceleration. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were up 2% and grew by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco-related revenues and a larger-than-usual decline in the reported discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount revenue performance and the impact from Costco in just a few minutes.
First though, looking at the other revenue drivers in the quarter. Net interest income grew by 9% given our continued strong loan growth. We also saw an uptick in card fees, which increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was due primarily to growth in fees from our U.S. Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, all of which goes to the strength of these value propositions.
To now expand on the drivers of our discount revenue performance. We told you at our Investor Day that we will begin to provide some additional information, which you see on Slide 9. The top line in the chart shows the trend in our reported discount rate, which, to remind you, provides insight to our pricing at point of sale with merchants. The bottom line in the chart shows our calculated discount rate, which is the rate you would derive if you divided the discount revenue that we report on the P&L by total billed business. This includes the impact of other items such as growth trends in our network business, cash rebate rewards and incentives we pay to co-brand partners and to clients.
During the first quarter, the reported discount rate declined by 5 basis points, consistent with Anre Williams' comments at Investor Day about expecting a larger year-over-year change in the discount rate during the first half this year. In addition to the factors that have traditionally driven declines in our discount rate such as merchant negotiations and mix changes, we are also seeing an impact from the continued expansion of OptBlue as well as the regulatory changes in the EU that were enacted late last year.
As you're aware, expanding merchant coverage is a key priority for us, and we continue to make progress on going our merchant -- growing our merchant footprint this quarter. I'd also remind you that while growth in OptBlue does drive a decline in the discount rate, that impact has been more than offset on the bottom line by the benefits from incremental volumes and lower operating expenses from reduced incentive payments to merchant acquirers.
Looking forward, we expect the reported discount rate to decline by a greater amount in Q1 during the second quarter due to a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals. During the second half of the year, we expect a more modest decline in the discount rate as we will no longer have any spending at Costco where we were a lower-than-average discount rate.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 7 basis points in the quarter, driven in large part by the 5 basis point decrease in the reported discount rate. The 2 basis point gap versus the decline in the reported rate was driven primarily by continued strong growth in cash rebate rewards.
At Investor Day, we also committed to estimating our revenue growth rates, excluding Costco, which we have included on Slide 10. I'd remind you that there is some judgment in this estimation. Based on our analysis, Costco-related revenues were down approximately 11% year-over-year during Q1. As a result, we estimate that our FX-adjusted revenue growth rate, excluding the impact of Costco, improved modestly during the first quarter to approximately 5%. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on achieving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of this year. I would point out that we had an unusual benefit in discount revenue in Q2 '15 that will impact the revenue growth rate next quarter.
Turning to credit performance. Provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, as you can see in the chart on the left side of Slide 11. But this result reflects the impact of the held for sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held for sale portfolios are now recorded through a valuation allowance within operating expenses and are no longer included in provision. When you also exclude those credit costs from the prior year, adjusted provision increased by 12%, as shown on the right side of Slide 11. The growth in adjusted provision was driven by an increase in adjusted loan balances, including the strong growth of our merchant financing products. Card Member lending write-off rates were slightly lower year-over-year and remained the lowest amongst large peer issuers.
Consistent with our comments from Investor Day, going forward, we expect a continued growth in loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members will both contribute to an increase in provision. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic returns.
So now turning to expenses on Slide 12. Total expenses were up 5% and grew by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This reflected a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and was influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending. In recent years, our marketing and promotion spend was low during the first quarter and then ramped up for the year, beginning in Q2. Going forward, as part of our effort to optimize investments, we intend to spread more evenly the spend across all 4 quarters. We continue to expect that the total full year spending on growth initiatives during 2016 will be consistent with 2015 levels.
As we've discussed, one of the key focus areas for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. issuing businesses during the current quarter and nearly 1 million more from our international issuing businesses, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. These results include new cards from Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for another American Express product, which has been a significant driver of the higher acquisitions in recent quarters. An increasing portion of the new card acquisitions are also coming through digital channels as digital represented almost 2/3 of global consumer acquisitions this quarter.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. The year-over-year change in rewards expense was relatively in line with reported billed business growth. Cost of Card Member services grew by 8% during the quarter, which is significantly lower than its 2015 growth rate, as we have now lapped the reset impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. 
Operating expenses were up 2% on a reported basis during Q1 '16 but were influenced by a number of items, including the benefit from the JetBlue gain, the restructuring charge, higher investment levels and some specific benefits in the prior year. We continue to have a strong focus on controlling operating expenses and remain focused on reducing our cost base by $1 billion on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.
Towards this effort, we did incur the $84 million restructuring charge this quarter and expect to incur additional charges in future quarters, which, in aggregate, we expect to be significant as we fully roll out our cost reduction plans.
Finally, I did want to highlight that we expect operating expenses to be down significantly year-over-year during Q2, as the estimated $1 billion gain from the Costco portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 13. During the quarter, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while maintaining our capital ratios illustrates the strength of our balance sheet and business model. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2016 CCAR process earlier this month. And as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year.
While our 2016 CCAR submission reflected the benefit to our capital ratios from the Costco portfolio sale, I'd remind you that the submission also reflected a number of other changes versus the prior year, including the loss of Costco-related economics, our reduced earnings outlook for 2016 to 2017 and the more challenging set of economic assumptions in the Fed's severe scenario.
Our capital plan for the upcoming year will clearly be depended upon the Fed's view of our capital adequacy, and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance during the quarter was in line with the expectations we outlined at Investor Day. We continue to believe that our earnings per share outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains appropriate. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth and optimize investments, including driving new card acquisitions across our global and consumer portfolios, expanding our merchant footprint and increasing our share of the U.S. card lending.
We also remain focused on controlling our expenses, and the restructuring charge this quarter reflected the initial phase of actions to take $1 billion out of our cost base by the end of 2017. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality, and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth."

A couple of questions there. So we tried last month at our Investor Day to lay out some level of detail, both our expectations for 2016 and 2017 as well as the really key initiatives that we are focused on, on both the accelerating revenue side as well as the cost side to achieve those results. As I sit here this afternoon and talk about our first quarter results, as I said in my remarks, I'd say we're tracking with all the -- both initiatives we're focused on and we're tracking with the expectations we laid out. You are correct that we feel good today about our efforts to accelerate growth, and we feel good in particular about some of our ability to put other Amex cards into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. Clearly, in the second half of the year, we will be very focused on maintaining the loyalty of those and other customers. There will be a lot of change in the industry in the back half of the year, and that's why I added just a few words of caution about the fact that we think we've taken a very balanced view as we provide you an outlook for the back half. But we'll have to see. It's still very early. But so far, so good. In terms of the European Union, you're right, the new interchange caps went into effect in December, early December of last year. To remind everyone, while those don't directly impact American Express, we've said for quite a while now that over a period of time, as we, on an ongoing basis, negotiate contracts with merchants, we would expect that to put some downward pressure on our discount rates. To some extent, if you think about it, it keeps -- pressure to keep the differential because we generally have a premium in most of those markets somewhat in line with its history. So that impact, you do see reflected in our Q1 results, is one of the reasons that you see an unusual decline in the discount rates by historical standards. It will probably take us a couple of years to work through a negotiating cycle with all the merchants. In terms of the impact on volumes, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe in Q1, and we feel pretty good about them in the U.K., in particular. We are very focused on using all the aspects of our business model and our closed loop to really create and sustain great value propositions for our customers. We think we have a tremendous ability to do that. And the interchange caps create some competitive challenges for others and perhaps some opportunities for us, so we'll have to see how all that plays out over time. But right now, we're pleased."

Thanks for the question, Craig. We do feel good about the last several years. I do want to keep coming back to our performance and our ability to grow our lending book, which is predominantly U.S. consumer, at rates above what you're seeing in the industry is not a new trend. It's something we've been doing for a few years. You've seen a modest increase in the differential between us and the industry. But the whole industry, as you know, Craig, has also trended up a little bit this year. When you look at the composition of the Q1 increases, it's -- as Doug Buckminster talked about at Investor Day, it's about 1/3 coming from existing customers and about 2/3 from new customers. And when you look at the credit profile, we continue to feel really good about our success in achieving these growth rates some time ago, sustaining them and doing it in a way that keeps our average credit profile quite consistent with our history. So we think there's a lot of reasons we've been able to do this, and there's a lot of reasons we should be able to continue to do it for a long time when you look at the fact that we historically under-index on the portion of our own customers and people who look like our customers borrowing behaviors. And so we think with our renewed focus on having the right products, the right marketing, the right offers out in the marketplace to better attract our fair share of those behaviors, that we have a long runway to continue to achieve the kind of performance you saw in Q1."

I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hands to when it begins to get used when, for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical avera",420,"Good questions, Sanjay. I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hands to when it begins to get used when, for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average that would probably cause us to say you're going to see a real meaningful financial impact begin to -- or positive financial impact begin to happen more in the second and third year, partly driven by the fact that, historically, in the industry, you have a range of incentives and offers that go with the card acquisition. In the current competitive environment, I would say that's true now. So one of the factors, as you think, Sanjay, about some of the comments we've made about being very focused on seeing acceleration in our revenue growth, adjusting for Costco in the back half of the year, is -- as we just look at the sheer math of our -- the various new card members that we've acquired in recent quarters as they age through the process I just described, you'll begin to see an uplift as we get into the back half of this year. In terms of my cautionary comments, you're correct. There's nothing more than really me flagging what I think should be everyone -- obvious to everyone, which is the size and magnitude of the portfolio transfer we're about to engage in on the Costco portfolio with Citi is, I think, pretty unprecedented in the industry. So that just makes us slightly cautious about our own forecasting abilities in terms of how consumers will behave because we don't have a perfect precedent for all of the conditions that you see changing in the industry. And it would manifest itself, as you point out, Sanjay, through what behavior Costco co-brand card members who have some other Amex products, which they may have had for a long time or a short time, how their behavior changes if they can't use the Amex card at Costco and, for that matter, how Amex card members, not Costco co-brand card members, which is other types of Amex card members who traditionally do some portion of their shopping at Costco, how their behavior changes. So all that's factored into our outlook with our -- what we think is a fairly balanced perspective on the ups and downs. But there's probably a little bit more forecasting error than I would say is usual for us."

They have to vary because the acquiring landscape, the regulatory landscape varies in every country. But those programs tend to be newer than OptBlue, which we've now been at for a couple of years. That said, we've said from the beginning that it's a multiyear effort to get to where we want to get to with OptBlue. One of the targets we laid out for the first time in Investor Day, as you know, Bob, a few weeks ago was saying we think we could get to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. And I think we're always cautious in saying you have to get to parity coverage in reality first and then you have to also take some time to let the perception of that coverage also get -- catch up to the reality. So this is a long game we're playing. We are pleased with how it's going in terms of our ability at this point to say we have merchant acquirers who are part of the program, who basically cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S. Not all of those acquirers or a few of the big ones still will be rolling out as we go through the rest of the year. So though it's a long game, we think it's going fine, but the really material impacts take some number of years to really be seen in the financials. In the meantime, the point I was trying to make in my remarks is in the short term, even before perceptions change and perceptions changing will ultimately help you with acquisition response rate, with overall share of wallet, et cetera. But in the near term, you clearly get the incremental spend from the incremental merchants you're signing up. There is the lower discount rate impact fee every quarter. There's also some savings on the OpEx side because we used to pay some fees to our third-party acquirers. We're not paying anymore. When you net those 3 pieces together, ignoring any potential share of wallet or acquisition efficiency benefits, that number turned positive in 2015. It's a very modest number, so it's not a number overall you would note in the financials because, remember, coverage is about small merchants who are really important to the perceptions of coverage but, in fact, don't drive that many or that big of a percentage of the overall spend dollars. So that's where we are. We feel good about the program. We feel good that it's today on a path where it's having a positive impact on the P&L. But the really larger vision and more material impact is clearly some time away."

And I think you're probably not surprised to say I'm a little cautious about giving you precise numbers right now for competitive reasons. But let me try to help you and others think a little bit about the magnitude here. We showed a slide, not this quarter but in the last 2 quarters, a little bit -- 2 quarters ago, a little bit of history on card acquisitions. And you're right, these are gross numbers. We don't net out attrition. Attrition hasn't changed a lot the last couple of years. There's some lumpiness in attrition because there are times when we'll embark on a program where we take inactive accounts and terminate them. But attrition materially hasn't changed much in a few years. So that slide 2 quarters ago will give you a little bit of a sense for some of the historical numbers to compare that 2.1 million to. And as I said in my remarks, some good portion of the increment above the standard run rate, though not all, is driven by the success we've had in putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. When you think about retention, I'd just remind you though of a couple of other things we've said over the course of the past year. One is that we talked a while back about how, in Canada, where there was no portfolio sale. At one point last year, we talked about retaining a little over 50% of the out-of-store spend. And when we said that, we were very quick to say -- and in the U.S., you would expect the number to be significantly lower because there is a portfolio sale and because we have been and continue to operate under a series of contractual restrictions about how we can market to Costco co-brand card members. And once the sale happens in mid-June, those card members will no longer be known to us that they will be customers of one of our competitors. So that should produce a very different result. Within the box I just tried to paint for you though, I would say we're pleased with our results thus far. But I will go back a little bit to my response to Sanjay's question and say the real battle for the hearts and minds of our customers is still in its early stages, I would say."

That would not count as a new card, but it is one of the things -- one of the many things we're doing to help drive a little higher growth in our loan balances. I think it is important to point out though, Rick, another change though you have seen really over the last couple of years is a little bit of a renewed focus by us on making sure we also have the right lending-oriented products. And I think the launch of the EveryDay card is a good example of that in recent years. Clearly, there's a lot of focus these days on the Cashback market, and we think our Blue Cash Card is a very competitive and generally lending-oriented card in that space. So we talk a lot about the breadth of our product line. And we really believe in the breadth of our product line because it allows us to have many different kinds of value propositions so we can reach out to many different segments of the marketplace. And I think our efforts around lending, whether it be what we're doing for charge card members through LOC or some new products like EveryDay or some products that have been around for a little while like Blue Cash are all manifestations of that strategy of having a very targeted and broad product strategy."

I would point out though that, obviously, we were quite engaged in negotiations with Costco ourselves. And as part of any co-brand negotiations, you talk a lot about the value proposition as part of a negotiation. So I don't think we were particularly surprised. I' d make I a few other points though, and I'm going to go back actually to something I just said in response to Rick. We really focus on and I think a strength of ours is the breadth of our product line and the way that allows us to add different value propositions for different segments of the market. There is not 1 cashback market. There's not 1 rewards market. There's lots of different customer segments, and they value different things. The Citi Costco product will be a good product that will appeal to a certain demographic, a certain segment. I would point out, sort of a cashback product, you can actually only use it, including our co-brand card, at Costco in terms of the rewards. And if you look at our cashback portfolio, the Blue Cash product, we feel really good about that value proposition. It has been a real -- one of the real engines of customer acquisition for us. It's got good economics. It is a lend-oriented product to some of my comments earlier. And it seems to compete very well in the face of the current competitive landscape, which, in pure math, probably includes some products that are a little richer than the Costco co-brand. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are, and I wouldn't anticipate that there's anything that we've seen in the latest announcements that will cause us to change our current strategies. I also want to come back, David, to your comments about the second half. Maybe I want to be a little careful here and not overplay the forecast uncertainty in the second half. The reason I brought it up is I thought I was stating something fairly obvious, which is that it is an unprecedented change in the industry. We try -- are trying very hard to be transparent and balanced in our outlook. And so as we have said for quite some time, the second half, by definition, includes a little bit more uncertainty. But there's really nothing new about our view there. There's nothing new that we've seen in the marketplace that caused us to be any less certain. In fact, with each passing week, we know more than we do the week before."

So in our experience, customers make decisions for many different reasons and value different things. And we really try to focus on both having different products that target what each customer segment most values and trying to think about and really leverage the things that we can most uniquely offer. So the strength of our brand is the first thing I think you always have to start with, which is the strength of our brand and its reputation for high-level service and trust. And really taking the side of our customers is something that I think is hard for others to match and we think is something that allows us to appeal to customers as something that is difficult for a competitor to copy. When you look at the rewards-oriented customer, the breadth and depth and size of our Membership Rewards program allows us to offer a range of ways for people to use what's really an alternative currency in some way. That is very difficult for others to match because they just don't have the size and scale of the program we have. When you look at our closed loop network, you're correct, it allows us to do some things on the offer side, in particular, not only do some things that are merchant-funded but also do some things that use our evolving big data capabilities to be very targeted in ways that are difficult for others to match. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry, which is part -- one part of the advantages of our closed loop, very difficult for others to match. So I could go on and we should -- I'll go on to the next question. But the point I'm trying to make is we are all about trying to think about the unique things we can offer to a customer that derive from our unique position as a closed loop global network with a great brand and great reach rather than just say, ""This is about mathematically competing on one particular aspect of a cards economics."""

You have other year-over-year factors as you think about the quarter as well. I would point out, you have lower gas prices. We're particularly T&E-oriented, probably more than most, so lower airline ticket prices in my old industry probably impact us as well. When you think about Costco, as I said in my remarks, when you look at the incremental cards we're acquiring, a significant portion of the increment is driven by those efforts to put other Amex products in the hands of Costco co-brand card members. I don't want to be more specific for competitive reasons beyond that. What I would say is that's also part of what drives our statement, as I said earlier, that we'd expect as you get into the back half of this year and next year, a little bit further uptick in the financial metrics. Because as we put those cards in the hands of people, it does take some time before you really see a meaningful financial impact. You've got to put the card in people's hands.

The answer to the first part is pretty straightforward. Yes. When you look at our coverage today versus that of the 2 dominant networks, it's really -- the gap is all about small merchants. For the most part, with very rare exceptions like Costco, which only accepts Amex today, medium- and large-size merchants, generally, we deal with directly, and our coverage is pretty much at parity. So it's really all about the small merchants, and that's where we clearly concluded that we need the arms and legs and help of the third-party merchant acquirers to reach the many, many, many millions of small merchants, where there's a fair amount of churn as well to get them into our network. That's also why, as we just look at the sheer math and the fact that we now have agreements with merchant acquirers who cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S., we feel pretty confident in saying it's a matter of time before they're able to put us into all of those merchants. So that's the logic behind OptBlue and how the small merchants fit in with the medium to large merchants. So if the question is, are we learning anything in OptBlue that would cause us to change our view about the direct connections we have with the larger merchants? I would say the answer -- short answer is no. We really value those connections. I think the merchants value them. We are able because of the closed loop -- disclosed some of the comment I made earlier. We think to bring some value to those relationships that are not always easy for others to match, and so we very much want to keep those connections."

So, yes, we expect the Costco gain to come in, in June approximately $1 billion. Unlike previous years, we are spreading across, evenly throughout the year, our investment or growth-oriented spend. The biggest chunk of which appears in marketing and promotion. So to be very granular, that means that if you just look at our marketing and promotional line for all of 2016, you should expect it to look about like it did in 2015. And in fact, you just saw us in Q1 raise Q1 closer to an average level that you will see across the next 3 quarters. So that's what you'll see on the marketing and promotional line. And so, really, the gain will, mostly to your point, fall to the bottom line in the second quarter. Although I do think there's one other important caveat to remind people of, which is we do expect more restructuring charges, including some, hard to quantify right now, in the second quarter. And those would be some incremental offset to the gain as well. And those restructuring charges, just to be crystal clear, because of our -- the challenge in trying to estimate them, we have, as we provided our $5.40 to $5.70 EPS outlook, said that excludes all restructuring charges this year. Just to give you a clearer, cleaner view into the performance of the company."

But I think sometimes, people overplay just how big that increment is as we get ever more efficient with our acquisition efforts every year. And I made the point that 2/3 of our consumer acquisitions in Q1 were digital. It's those kinds of statistics, Bill, that give us confidence that we can continue to edge that number down without seeing a significant impact on our acquisition efforts."

And so we are not particularly trying to target to use your term, the gamers. And in fact, we'll work a little bit to specifically not attract the gamers. So we feel pretty good, I would say, on balance about the economics of the Blue Cash Card. And certainly, one of the things we watch is the overall portfolio of consumer cards that we have in the U.S. or for that matter in any market. And so when you look at our card acquisitions, yes, the Blue Cash Card has been a particular important acquisition engine in recent quarters, but I'd point out to you that's because part of what we're trying to do is put replacement cards in the hands of people who formerly had a Costco co-brand card. And so the Blue Cash Card tends to appeal to that segment of the market. Meanwhile, we've continued our historical acquisition efforts with Gold, the Platinum. The Delta card is going tremendously well. And I think you've heard Delta made some comments about that as well. So we have a range of products, and Blue Cash is just one of them, which appeals to a particular segment, is lend-oriented and is producing perfectly fine economics for us. In terms of an overall rewards rate, we don't really look at it that way. I guess what I'd say is, certainly, rewards costs -- the cash rebate rewards costs are growing faster than our company average because those products are growing faster than the company average. And you see me calling that out a little bit in my discussion earlier about the calculated discount rate. They're still a very modest piece of the overall company's cards and economics, so it's one important thing to keep in mind. So, look, I'd say this is all part of our strategy of having the broadest product line and offering lots of different value propositions. We make sure that all of the value propositions are economic for our shareholders while providing good value to customers, and I think the Blue Cash Card fits right into that vein."

Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale",3646,"Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio, a continued slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale, a $232 million restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts and an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking beyond these discrete items, our underlying results for the second quarter were solid and consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Investor Day in March for both 2016 and 2017. Excluding the impact from Costco-related volumes and FX, billings and adjusted revenue growth were generally consistent with recent quarters and our Investor Day expectations.
On the expense side, provision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations, as write-off rates have remained steady and growth in rewards had been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. While operating expenses were also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well controlled. And during the quarter, we continued to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders, including repurchasing $1.7 billion of outstanding shares. 
We also made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives.
In addition, we continue to make good progress on the steps needed to reduce our cost base by $1 billion, which drove the $232 million restructuring charge.
Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% year-over-year during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior year and increased 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19, and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition. Primarily due to the Costco-related impacts, we did see a sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates versus the first quarter in line with our expectations.
Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale, the majority of which held to the bottom line during the second quarter. The gain was offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives that we expect to maintain for all 4 quarters of 2016.
As I mentioned, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which when combined with the $1.1 billion we repurchased in Q1 represents our highest ever level of share buybacks over a 2-quarter period. This higher level of share repurchases helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count versus the prior year. 
Our net income for the quarter, combined with the decline in average shares outstanding, drove EPS of $2.10, which was 48% higher than the prior year.
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge, was $2.26. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended June 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our performance metrics during Q2, starting with billed business on Slide 3. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth slowed sequentially to 4% during the quarter, driven by the decline in Costco-related volumes. Similar to last quarter, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. Billings growth adjusted from Costco and FX was consistent with the prior quarter at 8%, though I would remind you that Q1 included an extra day for leap year. 
To put this metric into context, I would also remind you that a portion of the new cards acquired in recent quarters relates to Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for a new Amex product. Our efforts around this began early last year and continued until the portfolio sale date. Although the ultimate outcome will cloud over time, we are pleased with the demand for our products and the success we've had in putting cards into the hands of former Costco co-brand card members, while, of course, closely following the terms of our agreements with Citi. We expect to capture at least 20% -- we expect to capture this 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco co-brand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale. This spending is helping to provide a lift in the adjusted billings growth rate shown on Slide 4 and will create a number of lapping dynamics as we move forward.
Stepping back, the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio highlights the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape and why we have been adapting our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and accelerate growth. We plan to continue to aggressively pursue the full range of growth opportunities that we discussed in our Investor Day in March. These efforts cut across all our businesses, customer segments and geographies, including our initiatives to grow lending; our push towards parity coverage in the U.S.; our focus on accelerating growth in small business and middle market; continued strong growth outside the U.S.; and of course, our efforts to grow our consumer business in the U.S., where there will be many complex market dynamics in coming quarters. These efforts all have the common goal of helping to accelerate the company's overall revenue growth, which is what we as a management team are focused on.
Going forward, while we will provide the adjusted billings and revenue performance of the company for the next 4 quarters, our focus will be on the outcomes of all of these efforts, not just the narrower performance around former Costco co-brand card members.
As we turn now to the segment and regional billings performance on slides 5 and 6, clearly, Costco had a significant impact on our U.S. results as well on the performance of our USCS and GCS segments. Given that impact, I'll highlight a few of the other significant drivers of our billings performance during the quarter rather than reviewing the regions and segments individually.
Lower gas and airline ticket prices remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. International volumes continued to be strong, with FX-adjusted growth of 10% and performance remained relatively consistent across most regions.
To turn to EMEA in particular, given the recent Brexit vote, I would remind you that the EMEA region constituted approximately 10% of our worldwide volumes in Q2. Our U.K. business constitutes 3% or 4% of worldwide billings, and it has been growing in excess of 10% in recent quarters. We did see a noticeable slowdown in this growth in the first several days immediately after the Brexit vote, but that growth has since rebounded to its prior strong levels.
From an FX perspective, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Like all companies with European operations, we are monitoring the situation closely to determine whether we will need to make any modifications to our business practices. At this point, we continue to operate as usual.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 '15, reflecting the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios in the first of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we had excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is slightly higher than the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry.
Now similar to my earlier comments on billings, I would point out that a portion of the loan growth in recent quarters comes as a result of our efforts to have former Costco co-brand card members sign up for another Amex product. 
Taking a step back, we have been pleased by our steady growth in loans for several years now, and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were down 1% but grew by 1% after adjusting for changes in FX. FX-adjusted revenue growth reflected increases in underlying billings and loans, offset by declines in Costco volumes and a decrease in the calculated discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount rate performance and the impact from Costco in a few minutes.
Turning first though to the other drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw a 7% increase in card fees versus the prior year. The growth was again driven in part by strong performance within our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios and is a clear indication that our value propositions continue to resonate in the marketplace. Net interest income increased by 2% during the quarter, though growth did slow sequentially versus the first quarter due primarily to the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios as well as the continued drop-off in Costco loans prior to the portfolio of sale dated [ph] June. As we disclosed previously, the JetBlue co-brand portfolio constituted between 1% and 2% of our worldwide loan balances. 
Looking forward, and given all the recent uncertainty around forward interest rate expectations, I'd remind you that unlike most other banks, we benefit from lower interest rates and are negatively impacted by pricing rates due primarily to the presence of our charge card portfolio.
To turn back now to the drivers of our discount rate and revenue performance. On Slide 9, we are again showing the trends in our reported and calculated discount rates. As expected, discount revenue growth during Q2 was impacted by a larger year-over-year decline in the reported discount rate than in Q1 due to the prior year merchant rebate accrual benefit.
On a year-to-date basis, the reported discount rate is down 6 basis points versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our 6 to 7 basis point expectation from Investor Day.
Similar to last quarter, we are also seeing an impact on the discount rate from the continued expansion of OptBlue and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the EU that went into effect late last year. We do expect to see a much smaller drop in the reported discount rate during the second half of the year through to the end of the Costco relationship.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 10 basis points versus the prior year during Q2, driven in part by the 6 basis point drop in the reported discount rate. As a reminder, a calculated rate is also influenced by counter revenue items, including cash and rebates rewards, corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments as well as by growth in our GNS volumes. Growth and cash rebate rewards continues to make up the majority of the year-over-year change, driven primarily by our strong cash rebate card acquisitions and billings growth in recent quarters. 
I'll note that while this is driving increased contra [ph] revenues, we are seeing an offset in the rewards expense line, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in my remarks.
Moving now to Slide 10. We've included our estimate of Costco-related revenues. I'll remind you that there is some judgment involved with this estimate. Based on our analysis, we estimate that Costco-related revenues declined by approximately 32% versus last year during the quarter. Based on this estimate, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, slowed modestly on a sequential basis to 4% in Q2, driven primarily by the prior year discount rate benefit. On a year-to-date basis, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, has been about 5%, slightly above our exit rate for 2015.
As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on driving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of the year.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 11. Our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date basis and remain best in class amongst large issuer peers. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would begin to trend up a little bit given the seasoning our loan portfolio. I would note that as part of the portfolio of sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from the Costco co-brand portfolio, which related primarily to canceled accounts. These accounts are not expected to have a significant impact on provision as they are already reserved for at higher levels, but they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10% -- 10 basis points during Q2 and will impact our reported write-off rate over the next 2 quarters.
Turning to provision on Slide 12. Total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 '15, as you can see on the left side of the slide. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios were accounted for through a valuation allowance within operating expenses. When you exclude those credit costs from [ph] the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased by 13% [indiscernible] to a relatively consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance.
Consistent with our Investor Day comments, we expect that both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members will contribute to an increase in provision [indiscernible] forward.
Training then to expense performance on Slide 13. Total expenses decreased by 15% versus the prior year, but were impacted by several discrete items. Excluding the Costco portfolio of sale gain and the restructuring charge in the current quarter, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% versus the prior year and continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking at the individual expense line, MMP [ph] was up 4% versus the prior year, as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of the key areas of focus for our investments, and we were pleased that these efforts drove 2.1 million new card acquisitions across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 3 million on a worldwide basis. As I mentioned, Costco co-brand card members signing up for new cards has been a key driver of the increased acquisitions in recent quarters, but we do expect acquisitions to slow somewhat during the second half of the year.
While we have previously expected, our total spending on growth initiatives during full year 2016 to be similar to 2015, we now expect to spend at a somewhat higher level. The increased spending will support a range of initiatives across the company, including some of the potential opportunities within the U.S. marketplace that I mentioned earlier. Our ultimate investment level will, of course, be driven by the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, but we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least $200 million above the 2015 level of $3.1 billion.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. Rewards expense decreased by 2% versus the prior year despite there being a 2% year-over-year increase in proprietary billings. This trend is being driven by a shift in volumes from products that have the rewards costs cast classified as an expense item such as Costco co-brand to products that have rewards reported as contra revenue items such as cashback. Total rewards costs, including cash rebates, were up 1% in the current quarter, which is roughly in line with the growth in proprietary billings.
While it's a smaller expense line, cost of Card Member services increased by 16% versus the prior year. This line can be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter due to timing issues. But due to increased usage of some of the Card Member benefits that we've recently added, including new [indiscernible] clubs and airline fee credits, I would expect it to be up around 10% for the full year.
Operating expenses were down 31% versus the prior year, but were impacted by both the portfolio of sale gain and the restructuring charge. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, reflecting our strong focus on controlling costs.
We feel good about our progress, our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As a continuing part of that effort, we do expect to incur some additional restructuring charges in future quarters as we continued rollout our plans, though I expect they will be smaller than what we incurred this quarter. We also anticipate that a portion of our increased investment spending will occur in operating expenses over the balance of 2016.
Turning last to capital on Slide 14. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we finished fully utilizing our 2015 CCAR authorization, repurchasing $6.6 billion of shares over the past 5 quarters, including $1.7 billion in the second quarter. 
As you recall, our 2015 CCAR submission included a higher level of net income than our actual performance, so this -- since it assumed that our relationship with Costco will continue. However, given the performance of our underlying business and the benefits from the Costco portfolio of sale, we were still able to fully utilize our CCAR 2015 capacity, while maintaining our strong capital ratios. 
We were also pleased with the 2016 CCAR results, which were released last month, as the Federal Reserve did not object to our CCAR 2016 plan to return up to $4.4 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 quarter. These potential payouts are aligned with our Investor Day expectations and will enable us to provide a steady return of capital to our shareholders.
As you are all well aware, CCAR continues to be a very complex process. In general, capital plans are governed by the Fed modeling, which can have very different results from a bank's own expectations. For example, in the current year, the Fed assumes that our risk-weighted assets would increase in a severe stress scenario despite the loss of the Costco co-brand portfolio. It was very different from our own projections. I'd also highlight that we have the highest ROE amongst all the bank holding companies that go through the CCAR process. In combination with our high payout ratio, this result in a large reduction in capital levels over the CCAR period in a severely adverse scenario. 
For example, if we payout 100% of base case net income, our capital ratios would be reduced by well over 50% [ph] in a severe stress scenario.
Thinking more broadly, the 2016 CCAR results once again highlighted the strength of our business model and balance sheet as we generated the highest net income amongst all bank holding companies in a severe stress scenario and our capital ratios before the impact of capital actions were also in the top quartile.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage, driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focus on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
During the past 6 months, we have said that our full year 2016 outlook was for adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.70. We now believe that full year 2016 EPS will be at the high end of this range as our year-to-date performance has been better than our original expectations, driven largely by the favorability in our credit and expense performance. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Given that we're only halfway through 2016, our outlook for full year 2017 EPS to at -- to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate that earnings will be lower during the second half of 2016 through the end of our relationship with Costco and the fact that we now expect to invest at higher levels during 2016 than we did in 2015.
As we have discussed several times, there is a bit more uncertainty around our second half 2016 assumptions. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have an updated view on the complex dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace as we progress through the balance of the year.

So I would say that's in the run rate for the most part in the second quarter. It continued to build even as we went through the second quarter and should stay in the run rate, subject to the complex dynamics, which I'll come to in a second. And I mentioned that 20% in the context of the disclosure we're making about our billings and revenue and for that matter, loan growth rates where we pull Costco out of the prior year base. Some of the growth does come from the efforts and the success we've had in putting other Amex products in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members. Complex dynamics. When you look at the back half of 2016, it's a certainly not news to anyone on this call, it's a very competitive environment right now. And you have many changes that are rocked by the switch from Amex to Citi [ph] of the Costco co-brand. You have are many other competitors who have launched either new marketing efforts or new products that perhaps are targeted at some of the same types of card members. In our case, we have a range of marketing efforts targeted at lots of consumers and lots of different segments of the consumer world in the U.S., including the fact that the former Costco co-brand card members who just dropped into our broader prospect pool at this time, we also for us have some complex dynamics around geographies and certain geographies where the Costco co-brand card members, for example, might have been a more significant part of total Amex cardholders. So all of those dynamics are complex. And then if you think about the broader external environment, you have tremendous uncertainty around interest rates. I would point out to you, we -- as we thought about this call, originally thought I might want to talk about the potential of lower rates. When you think about the last 24 hours, you've had the Fed sort of back talking about higher rates, we'll have to see. Certainly, all of the election dynamics here in the U.S., and for that matter, the dynamics in the U.K. and the EU probably create more uncertainty than we're used to. So I could go, but I think you probably get the point that there's a lot of different changes going on but just make this a little bit cautious so we try to be very balanced in the outlook that we've given you for the back half of 2016 and what that means for 2017, but we'll have to see where things really come out."

I think the first thing that's important to think about is we now for several years have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates, and we've done that while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics and without seeing any significant increase in the credit metrics or changes in our overall risk profile. So it's a continuation of a trend. And that loan growth is coming from many different areas. We have a nice loan portfolio that's been growing steadily in our U.S. small business franchise open. We have a range of consumer products targeted at attracting more of our customers borrowing behavior. And for us, because traditionally, and we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day in March, because traditionally, over the last probably 5, 6 years, we have probably underinvested in terms of our efforts to attract the borrowing behaviors of our own Card Members, both consumer and small business, as well as underinvested in terms of targeting prospects who, from a credit perspective, look just like our customers but are a little bit more revolving centric. As we have turned our efforts more to those kinds of customers, this is not trying to get more lending growth out of our existing customers -- excuse me, out of customers who we're already tapping into our fair share of their lending behaviors, it's really how do we tune our efforts to just attract an equivalent lending share to what we already have in our customers' spend share. So all of those efforts are what have led to the very steady performance you've seen. Now I think it is fair to say this quarter and last quarter, you're getting a little bit of an incremental boost that will fade in the next couple of quarters as we have moved some of the lending behaviors that were being done on a Costco co-brand cards onto other Amex products. And since you're looking at an adjusted number there where we've pulled all the Costco amount out of the base, that increases that 13% by a little bit. That will fade a little bit, but the broader trajectory, which we feel is a very thoughtful outcome of several years of steady effort in this area, we think that outcome will continue for the foreseeable future."

So a couple of comments. The investment piece to start with, as you point out, we have made a decision that as we look at all of the complex market dynamics, which I just talked about in response to the last question, we're going to increase somewhat in the second half of the year and increase for full year 2016 over 2015 our overall level of investments. Those investments take many forms. Some of them are pure marketing and acquisition investments, some of them are technology investments that are about building capabilities and infrastructure. All of them are targeted at a mixture of very short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits. And as we look at our performance in the first half of the year where we've done a little bit better on expenses and provision than we expected and revenues are tracking as we expected, we felt very comfortable, even going to the higher end of our guidance range and increasing the investments a little bit. Our view of 2017 though has [ph] changed. And that in 2017, our expectation would be that elevated level absolutely falls away and particularly some of the capability building that we're funding here are projects that very naturally will fall away. Now a question I get a lot is, ""How can you consider a more significant decrease in this investment level without thinking it's going to impact your revenue growth?"" Well, part of the reason is the things like I just described with Visa projects that we very discreetly decided to fund, they will naturally fall away. The other thing to keep in mind is that we feel we are making very good progress on our efforts to pool [ph] $1 billion out of the cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have said all along, sometimes to get to those ultimate positive outcomes, we actually have to spend some money, right? If you are automating things for a little while, you have to spend the money on automation before you can put the automation into place and take the costs out. If you are right sharing things, you often have to duplicate teams in place for a little while until everything is running smoothly. In the back half of 2016, you have some of those added costs actually working against [indiscernible]. We are very comfortable though with the track and the line of sight we have into 2017, we feel very good about the progress we're making on costs. So that will be a significant benefit in 2017 versus what you will see in the back half of 2016. So those are the components that go into what we mean when we say we're at an elevated level of investments. It's going to elevate them a little bit more, and it helps you a little bit to think about the big moving pieces that help you get from the back half of 2016 to the EPS guidance we have given you for 2017, which as we sit here today, I remain very comfortable with."

In the consumer segment, you have had the biggest benefit from the phenomenon I described about the success we've had putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. As we finish lapping that, you will actually see some, just due to that effect alone, modest decline in the U.S. consumer rates. That's something we anticipate and is consistent with all the plans we've laid out. Going against that, you have the efforts we have across our broad range of products to drive more billings through a range of efforts in the consumer segment. In the B2B segment, you have continue, as we talked about initially at Investor Day, to have the tail of a couple different segments of the market. We are seeing really nice growth in the small business and middle market area. And in fact, I would expect to see some acceleration in the middle market area in particular as we get in the back half of the year. The wildcard is in the largest corporate clients where, as we pointed out at Investor Day, that is not particularly a growth segment for us, and that continues to be a tough segment. I don't think there's many other Fortune 500 who are going on calls like we're having are right now and talking about growing their T&E budgets. And for us, in that large segment, we predominantly still have a T&E franchise. So we'll have to see how all those things play out.

On marketing to Costco co-brand Card Members, I would remind you, we sold the portfolio and very different from our situation in Canada. So we no longer have any access or, for that matter, knowledge from a marketing perspective of the former Costco co-brand Card Members, unless they happen to have another Amex card. Now those people drop anonymously in to the broader U.S. prospect pool that we constantly, as our competitors are trying to target with attractive offers of attractive products but we can actually not do any direct marketing to those people at this point. On the expense side, the way I think about it is that there's a couple of big components of the expenses. So people costs are the largest single components and they're now 315-million-or-so restructuring charges that we've taken, will get at a big chunk of the people savings. When you look at those restructuring charges, for the most part, those are for exits that occur over the course of 2016 with the overall inventory of them done by the end of 2016, but you don't necessarily really start seeing the savings until 2017. You have other components of costs, so there's a big professional fees component where we think we can get some savings. One of which is in the area of application development where we do a lot of outsourced work. Part of the elevated spending or elevated investment spending that we've been talking about is a lot of technological or technology development work that we think is going to be really valuable long term. That's the kind of stuff where we can actually dial it up even as we go through the back half of 2016 and very thoughtfully [ph] dial it down in 2017. Then you have a variety of other fees, renegotiated contracts, travel, all those kinds of things that constitute the remainder of the $1 billion. So while there are some savings that will begin to creep into the back half of 2017, mostly on the people side -- '16, excuse me, to a great extent, those are offset by some of the other costs I talked about earlier where we sometimes have to spend money to position ourselves to saving in 2017. So the net of all that is I feel very good about the progress we're making on the 2017 target, and we're working real hard to see just how much of it we can get quickly and early in 2017. And we'll obviously have to give you updates on that in future quarters, but I feel really good about the progress."

Let me take them in reverse, Chris. So the U.K., it is true that since the EU interchange regulations came into effect in early December, you have seen a couple of competitors pull back on some rewards, although it's not universal stretch of the imagination. What I would say is while that may help us over time, the really good growth rates we're seeing in the U.K. have actually been there for quite some time and predate any of those changes. So yes, look, we always say that regulation in our industry we think is generally not a good thing, not consumer-friendly and if so produce the best outcome and regulation around interchange will not directly impacting us does have an impact on balance not a good thing. All that so it does at times greater opportunities. So the flexibility of our business model gives us a number of levers to pull to try to take advantage of different environments and different sets of regulation. So we'll have to see over time. We feel good about our value proposition in the U.K. We feel really good about the growth rates that we've had for quite sometime. And if we could even accelerate those further, that would be a tremendous thing. In terms of the U.S., certainly, it's a competitive rewards environment. It has been for quite sometime. I would have to say I can't say that we've seen anything in the last 90 days that changes our view from what it would have been 90 days ago. And our broader strategy to compete in that environment, as you point out, Chris, is to have a wide range of value propositions because everybody's different. Everybody is something differently valued. That's why we have co-brand products. We have cashback products. We have Membership Rewards products. We have fee-based products. We have multi-based products, et cetera, et cetera. And we think that kind of targeting allows us to deliver the most value to each customer segment in the most efficient way from a shareholder perspective. Now I would have said, from our perspective, we are constantly innovating and evolving the Membership Rewards program, and we absolutely don't accept, just as a matter of course, we're going to have people of trading out of Membership Rewards. We fight for the loyalty business and try to earn the business of everyone of our card numbers on an ongoing basis. And the breadth of the Membership Rewards program, our ability to integrate it with other merchants and other offers we think allows us to do some really innovative and unparalleled things that are very difficult for others to offer and match. And we think it's part of why we continue to see good growth in our Membership Rewards products, and we're able to do it while still being able to manage the costs in a reasonable way."

Beyond that, what we laid out at our Investor Day was an expectation that you would see just because we're growing loans a lot, there's some seasoning of the portfolio, we expect that you would see some modest uptick in net write-off rates and then we painted some longer-term scenarios where we talked about may be write-off rates going up 10, 20 basis points a year. We haven't seen that yet. The legacy parts of our portfolios in most cases continued to actually strengthen. And the loan growth that we've been doing, we've been doing while still maintaining a very similar credit profile to what we've had for years. If you look at our new card acquisitions this quarter, the FICO's average over 750 as they have for many, many quarters in the past. There's not really a material change there.

So a couple of things I'd say. As you -- I don't know exactly what calculation you're doing, but it is true that if you look at the competitive environment right now, like others on a lot of our lending products, there is some kind of introductory period where there is an interest-free period. When you suddenly, as you saw this quarter, lap off in effect all of the Costco loans, which were mature loans not in that intro period, the percentage of the remaining portfolio that is in that introductory period all of a sudden pops up compared to the combined portfolio before. Nothing has actually changed in terms of the dollar. I think you see the proportion change. And so you do see a little bit of that effect this quarter. One of the complex lapping dynamics that I was referring to earlier in my prepared remarks is as we go through the next couple of quarters, the lapping impact of all of some of the offers, the customer behavior around the new Amex cards we put in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members, well amongst other things caused billings to trend down a little bit because we've had this surge, adjusted billings to trend down a little bit. We've had this surge as we brought these card members on. It will also though have a very positive effect on net interest income and on revenue in a few quarters as we get the majority of those people past those introductory periods. So when you think very long term, what I would say is that the mix -- overall mix in that we're offering to new and existing card members from an interest rate perspective is not considerably changing. This mixed effect that I just described, we will work through in the next couple of quarters as we finish lapping all the effects of the last 5-or-so quarters of some unusual dynamics around Costco. And once you're through all that, I wouldn't expect to see a material change in the prior trends."

But let me may be make just a few comments. Certainly, our growth has been held by the really nice progress we've made in the last 5 quarters on new card acquisitions, that growth manifests itself today particularly in the billings line. And then as the next couple of quarters roll by, that growth will increasingly move from the billings line into the loan balance and net interest income line as balances built for those who are revolvers, and it will go into the revenue line as we lap various introductory incentives, et cetera. Now that's a general statement is part of why we have said for some time, although I haven't repeated it today now that I think about it, that as we get into the last quarter of 2016 in particular, we expect to see some sequential increase in revenue growth rates. And part of the complex lapping dynamics I was talking about earlier is may be a little bit of sequential weakening in the billings rate adjusted for Costco, but revenue will be going in the other direction as we get into the end of this year for all the reasons that you're asking about. So the other comment I would make is one of the things that Doug Buckminster in particular talked about at Investor Day is the fact that we have seen some modest share of wallet losses amongst our existing customers. And one of our key initiatives in the consumer business is around a range of things we're doing to try to change that trend. I feel really good about the things we're doing. What I would say is it's a little early in the second quarter to say that they're actually having much of a material impact yet. I would say the second quarter is more impacted by what we've been doing around new card acquisitions. What I conclude from that is though, because I do feel good about those efforts, is I think that is something that you will see the fruits of as we get into the coming quarters."

We are laser-focused with the management team on getting back to the kind of consistent and fairly simple financial performance and financial model that drove this company for years. We are in an industry and with a business model that should allow us to get very consistent revenue growth. We have a heavily fixed cost nature, which allows us to get the operating expense leverage on that and we're not very capital intensive, so we get a bit of a capital kick on top of that. We feel really good, and I think we've very consistently demonstrated that we made real good progress on running the cost structure of the company -- or more efficiently and we're very committed with the use of the balance sheet. I think it's fair to say that with the competitive economic and regulatory environment, what it's been, that is what has been a larger challenge for us like many in the industry. Now as investors look at our results right now, there is a lot of complexity because of the evolution we're going through with Costco, and we're trying to sort through that complexity, but that complexity won't completely go away until you get all the way to the back half of 2017, which is when we will have to do all the various adjustments and try to help people understand the underlying trends. I would point out though that if you look at the first half 2016, you strip away Costco, you're at about 5% revenue growth. That's versus 4% last year. That 5% is benefiting a little bit from the Costco co-brand members who would put other Amex products in the hands of. That's our jumping off point and what we are very focused on as a management team, what we really tried to articulate at our Investor Day in March is our goal, our belief is we can get that number up. In particular, our target is to get it to the 6% scenario that we showed you at Investor Day, and we have a wide range of initiatives across our consumer business, across our B2B business, in terms of how we're working with merchants, wide range of initiatives targeted at getting us there. I think what we are working hard to be able to demonstrate to you and to all of our shareholders is that we are getting real traction on those initiatives, and you can see it in our results as we get into 2017 because I think we fully appreciate that this is not just about the EPS we put out [ph] in 2017, but it's about the way we get that EPS and the momentum it gives us as you go beyond 2017 into 2018. So that's why we have a very simple mantra at the company right now for 50,000 [ph] people of how far we use our accelerating revenue growth while we be set the cost base, while we be really focused about what we do with our investment followers. So in many ways, Bob, that's a great class question, and I think we'll probably going to stop there."

Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale",3632,"Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio, a continued slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale, a $232 million restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts and an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking beyond these discrete items, our underlying results for the second quarter were solid and consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Investor Day in March for both 2016 and 2017. Excluding the impact from Costco-related volumes and FX, billings and adjusted revenue growth were generally consistent with recent quarters and our Investor Day expectations.
On the expense side. Provision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations as write-off rates have remained steady and growth in rewards had been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. While operating expenses were also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well controlled. And during the quarter, we continued to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders, including repurchasing $1.7 billion of outstanding shares. 
We also made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives.
In addition, we continue to make good progress on the steps needed to reduce our cost base by $1 billion, which drove the $232 million restructuring charge.
Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% year-over-year during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior year and increased 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19, and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition. Primarily due to the Costco-related impacts, we did see a sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates versus the first quarter in line with our expectations.
Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale, the majority of which held to the bottom line during the second quarter. The gain was offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives that we expect to maintain for all 4 quarters 2016.
As I mentioned, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which, when combined with the $1.1 billion we repurchased in Q1, represents our highest-ever level of share buybacks over a 2-quarter period. This higher level of share repurchases helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count versus the prior year. 
Our net income for the quarter, combined with the decline in average shares outstanding, drove EPS of $2.10, which was 48% higher than the prior year.
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge was $2.26. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended June 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our performance metrics during Q2, starting with billed business on Slide 3. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth slowed sequentially to 4% during the quarter, driven by the decline in Costco-related volumes. Similar to last quarter, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. Billings growth adjusted from Costco and FX was consistent with the prior quarter at 8%, though I would remind you that Q1 included an extra day for leap year. 
To put this metric into context, I would also remind you that a portion of the new cards acquired in recent quarters relates to Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for a new Amex product. Our efforts around this began early last year and continued until the portfolio sale date. 
Although the ultimate outcome will cloud over time, we are pleased with the demand for our products and the success we've had in putting cards into the hands of former Costco co-brand card members, while, of course, closely following the terms of our agreements with Citi. 
We expect to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco co-brand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale. This spending is helping to provide a lift in the adjusted billings growth rate shown on Slide 4 and will create a number of lapping dynamics as we move forward.
Stepping back, the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio highlights the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape and why we have been adapting our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and accelerate growth. We plan to continue to aggressively pursue the full range of growth opportunities that we discussed in our Investor Day in March. These efforts cut across all our businesses, customer segments and geographies, including our initiatives to grow lending; our push towards parity coverage in the U.S.; our focus on accelerating growth in small business and middle market; continued strong growth outside the U.S.; and of course; our efforts to grow our consumer business in the U.S.; where there will be many complex market dynamics in coming quarters. These efforts all have the common goal of helping to accelerate the company's overall revenue growth, which is what we, as a management team, are focused on.
Going forward, while we will provide the adjusted billings and revenue performance of the company for the next 4 quarters, our focus will be on the outcomes of all of these efforts, not just the narrower performance around former Costco co-brand card members.
As we turn now to the segment and regional billings performance on slides 5 and 6, clearly, Costco had a significant impact on our U.S. results as well as on the performance of our USCS and GCS segments. Given that impact, I'll highlight a few of the other significant drivers of our billings performance during the quarter rather than reviewing the regions and segments individually.
Lower gas and airline ticket prices remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. International volumes continued to be strong, with FX-adjusted growth of 10%, and performance remained relatively consistent across most regions.
To turn to EMEA in particular, given the recent Brexit vote, I would remind you that the EMEA region constituted approximately 10% of our worldwide volumes in Q2. Our U.K. business constitutes 3% to 4% of worldwide billings, and it has been growing in excess of 10% in recent quarters. We did see a noticeable slowdown in this growth in the first several days immediately after the Brexit vote, but that growth has since rebounded to its prior strong levels.
From an FX perspective, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Like all companies with European operations, we are monitoring the situation closely to determine whether we will need to make any modifications to our business practices. At this point, we continue to operate as usual.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 '15, reflecting the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we had excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is slightly higher than the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry.
Now similar to my earlier comments on billings, I would point out that a portion of the loan growth in recent quarters comes as a result of our efforts to have former Costco co-brand card members sign up for another Amex product. 
Taking a step back, we have been pleased by our steady growth in loans for several years now, and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were down 1% but grew by 1% after adjusting for changes in FX. FX-adjusted revenue growth reflected increases in underlying billings and loans, offset by declines in Costco volumes and a decrease in the calculated discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount rate performance and the impact from Costco in a few minutes.
Turning first, though, to the other drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw a 7% increase in card fees versus the prior year. The growth was again driven in part by strong performance within our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios and is a clear indication that our value propositions continue to resonate in the marketplace. Net interest income increased by 2% during the quarter, though growth did slow sequentially versus the first quarter due primarily to the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios as well as the continued drop-off in Costco loans prior to the portfolio of sale dated June. As we disclosed previously, the JetBlue co-brand portfolio constituted between 1% and 2% of our worldwide loan balances. 
Looking forward, and given all the recent uncertainty around forward interest rate expectations, I'd remind you that unlike most other banks, we benefit from lower interest rates and are negatively impacted by rising rates due primarily to the presence of our charge card portfolio.
To turn back now to the drivers of our discount rate and revenue performance. On Slide 9, we are again showing the trends in our reported and calculated discount rates. As expected, discount revenue growth during Q2 was impacted by a larger year-over-year decline in the reported discount rate than in Q1 due to the prior year merchant rebate accrual benefit.
On a year-to-date basis, the reported discount rate is down 6 basis points versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our 6- to 7-basis-point expectation from Investor Day.
Similar to last quarter, we are also seeing an impact on the discount rate from the continued expansion of OptBlue and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the EU that went into effect late last year. We do expect to see a much smaller drop in the reported discount rate during the second half of the year through to the end of the Costco relationship.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 10 basis points versus the prior year during Q2, driven in part by the 6-basis-point drop in the reported discount rate. As a reminder, a calculated rate is also influenced by counter revenue items, including cash and rebates rewards, corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments as well as by growth in our GNS volumes. Growth and cash rebate rewards continues to make up the majority of the year-over-year change, driven primarily by our strong cash rebate card acquisitions and billings growth in recent quarters. 
I'll note that while this is driving increased contra revenues, we are seeing an offset in the rewards expense line, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in my remarks.
Moving now to Slide 10. We've included our estimate of Costco-related revenues. I'll remind you that there is some judgment involved with this estimate. Based on our analysis, we estimate that Costco-related revenues declined by approximately 32% versus last year during the quarter. Based on this estimate, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, slowed modestly on a sequential basis to 4% in Q2, driven primarily by the prior year discount rate benefit. On a year-to-date basis, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, has been about 5%, slightly above our exit rate for 2015.
As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on driving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of the year.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 11. Our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date basis and remain best in class amongst large issuer peers. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would begin to trend up a little bit given the seasoning of our loan portfolio. 
I would note that as part of the portfolio sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from the Costco co-brand portfolio, which related primarily to canceled accounts. These accounts are not expected to have a significant impact on provision as they are already reserved for at higher levels, but they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10% -- 10 basis points during Q2 and will impact our reported write-off rate over the next 2 quarters.
Turning to provision on Slide 12. Total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 '15, as you can see on the left side of the slide. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios were accounted for through a valuation allowance within operating expenses. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased by 13% to a relatively consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance.
Consistent with our Investor Day comments, we expect that both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will contribute to an increase in provision going forward.
Turning then to expense performance on Slide 13. Total expenses decreased by 15% versus the prior year but were impacted by several discrete items. Excluding the Costco portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge in the current quarter, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% versus the prior year and continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking at the individual expense line, MMP was up 4% versus the prior year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of the key areas of focus for our investments, and we were pleased that these efforts drove 2.1 million new card acquisitions across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 3 million on a worldwide basis. 
As I mentioned, Costco co-brand card members signing up for new cards has been a key driver of the increased acquisitions in recent quarters, but we do expect the acquisitions to slow somewhat during the second half of the year.
While we have previously expected, our total spending on growth initiatives during full year 2016 to be similar to 2015, we now expect to spend at a somewhat higher level. The increased spending will support a range of initiatives across the company, including some of the potential opportunities within the U.S. marketplace that I mentioned earlier. Our ultimate investment level will, of course, be driven by the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, but we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least $200 million above the 2015 level of $3.1 billion.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. Rewards expense decreased by 2% versus the prior year despite there being a 2% year-over-year increase in proprietary billings. This trend is being driven by a shift in volumes from products that have the rewards costs cast classified as an expense item such as Costco co-brand to products that have rewards reported as contra revenue items such as cashback. Total rewards costs, including cash rebates, were up 1% in the current quarter, which is roughly in line with the growth in proprietary billings.
While it's a smaller expense line, cost of Card Member services increased by 16% versus the prior year. This line can be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter due to timing issues. But due to increased usage of some of the Card Member benefits that we've recently added, including new airport clubs and airline fee credits, I would expect it to be up around 10% for the full year.
Operating expenses were down 31% versus the prior year but were impacted by both the portfolio of sale gain and the restructuring charge. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, reflecting our strong focus on controlling costs.
We feel good about our progress, our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As a continuing part of that effort, we do expect to incur some additional restructuring charges in future quarters as we continue roll out our plans, though I expect they will be smaller than what we incurred this quarter. We also anticipate that a portion of our increased investment spending will occur in operating expenses over the balance of 2016.
Turning last to capital on Slide 14. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we finished fully utilizing our 2015 CCAR authorization, repurchasing $6.6 billion of shares over the past 5 quarters, including $1.7 billion in the second quarter. 
As you recall, our 2015 CCAR submission included a higher level of net income than our actual performance so this -- since it assumed that our relationship with Costco will continue. However, given the performance of our underlying business and the benefits from the Costco portfolio of sale, we were still able to fully utilize our CCAR 2015 capacity while maintaining our strong capital ratios. 
We were also pleased with the 2016 CCAR results, which were released last month, as the Federal Reserve did not object to our CCAR 2016 plan to return up to $4.4 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 quarters. These potential payouts are aligned with our Investor Day expectations and will enable us to provide a steady return of capital to our shareholders.
As you are all well aware, CCAR continues to be a very complex process. In general, capital plans are governed by the Fed modeling, which can have very different results from a bank's own expectations. For example, in the current year, the Fed assumes that our risk-weighted assets would increase in a severe stress scenario despite the loss of the Costco co-brand portfolio. It was very different from our own projections. I'd also highlight that we have the highest ROE amongst all the bank holding companies that go through the CCAR process. In combination with our high payout ratio, this result in a large reduction in capital levels over the CCAR period in a severely adverse scenario. 
For example, if we pay out 100% of base case net income, our capital ratios would be reduced by well over 50% in a severe stress scenario.
Thinking more broadly, the 2016 CCAR results once again highlighted the strength of our business model and balance sheet as we generated the highest net income amongst all bank holding companies in a severe stress scenario, and our capital ratios before the impact of capital actions were also in the top quartile.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage, driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focus on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
During the past 6 months, we have said that our full year 2016 outlook was for adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.70. We now believe that full year 2016 EPS will be at the high end of this range as our year-to-date performance has been better than our original expectations, driven largely by the favorability in our credit and expense performance. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Given that we're only halfway through 2016, our outlook for full year 2017 EPS to at least -- to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate that earnings will be lower during the second half of 2016 through the end of our relationship with Costco and the fact that we now expect to invest at higher levels during 2016 than we did in 2015.
As we have discussed several times, there is a bit more uncertainty around our second half 2016 assumptions. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have an updated view on the complex dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace as we progress through the balance of the year. And of course, we will update our guidance at the end of the third quarter.
We're focused on our plan to accelerate revenue growth, optimize investments and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Toby, and then we'll take your questions."

So I would say that's in the run rate, for the most part, in the second quarter. It continued to build even as we went through the second quarter and should stay in the run rate, subject to the complex dynamics, which I'll come to in a second. And I mentioned that 20% in the context of the disclosure we're making about our billings and revenue and, for that matter, loan growth rates, where we pull Costco out of the prior year base. Some of the growth does come from the efforts and the success we've had in putting other Amex products in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members. 
Complex dynamics. When you look at the back half of 2016, it's a -- certainly not news to anyone on this call, it's a very competitive environment right now. And you have many changes that are rocked by the switch from Amex to Citi of the Costco co-brand. You have many other competitors who have launched either new marketing efforts or new products that perhaps are targeted at some of the same types of card members. In our case, we have a range of marketing efforts targeted at lots of consumers and lots of different segments of the consumer world in the U.S., including the fact that the former Costco co-brand card members who just dropped into our broader prospect pool at this time. We also, for us, have some complex dynamics around geographies and certain geographies where the Costco co-brand card members, for example, might have been a more significant part of total Amex cardholders. So all of those dynamics are complex. And then if you think about the broader external environment, you have tremendous uncertainty around interest rates. And I would point out to you, we, as we thought about this call, originally thought I might want to talk about the potential of lower rates. When you think about the last 24 hours, you've had the Fed sort of back-talking about higher rates. We'll have to see. Certainly, all of the election dynamics here in the U.S. and, for that matter, the dynamics in the U.K. and the EU probably create more uncertainty than we're used to. So I could go on, but I think you probably get the point that there's a lot of different changes going on that just make us this a little bit cautious so we try to be very balanced in the outlook that we've given you for the back half of 2016 and what that means for 2017, but we'll have to see where things really come out."

I think the first thing that's important to think about is we now, for several years, have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates, and we've done that while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics and without seeing any significant increase in the credit metrics or changes in our overall risk profile. So it's a continuation of a trend. And that loan growth is coming from many different areas. We have a nice loan portfolio that's been growing steadily in our U.S. small business franchise open. We have a range of consumer products targeted at attracting more of our customers' borrowing behavior. And for us, because traditionally, and we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day in March, because traditionally, over the last probably 5, 6 years, we have probably underinvested in terms of our efforts to attract the borrowing behaviors of our own card members, both consumer and small business, as well as underinvested in terms of targeting prospects who, from a credit perspective, look just like our customers but are a little bit more revolving centric. As we have turned our efforts more to those kinds of customers, this is not trying to get more lending growth out of our existing customers -- or excuse me, out of customers who we're already tapping into our fair share of their lending behaviors. It's really, how do we tune our efforts to just attract an equivalent lending share to what we already have in our customers' spend share. So all of those efforts are what have led to the very steady performance you've seen. 
Now I think it is fair to say this quarter and last quarter, you're getting a little bit of an incremental boost that will fade in the next couple of quarters as we have moved some of the lending behaviors that were being done on a Costco co-brand cards onto other Amex products. And since you're looking at an adjusted number there where we've pulled all the Costco amount out of the base, that increases that 13% by a little bit. That will fade a little bit, but the broader trajectory, which we feel is a very thoughtful outcome of several years of steady effort in this area, we think that outcome will continue for the foreseeable future."

I really could add, I think, important question, Chris. So a couple of comments. The investment piece to start with, as you point out, we have made a decision that as we look at all of the complex market dynamics, which I just talked about in response to the last question, we're going to increase somewhat in the second half of the year and increase for full year 2016 over 2015 our overall level of investments. Those investments take many forms. Some of them are pure marketing and acquisition investments, some of them are technology investments that are about building capabilities and infrastructure. All of them are targeted at a mixture of very short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits. And as we look at our performance in the first half of the year where we've done a little bit better on expenses and provision than we expected and revenues are tracking as we expected, we felt very comfortable, even going to the higher end of our guidance range and increasing the investments a little bit. Our view of 2017, though, has changed in that in 2017, our expectation would be that elevated level absolutely falls away and particularly, some of the capability building that we're funding here are projects that, very naturally, will fall away. Now a question I get a lot is, ""how can you consider a more significant decrease in this investment level without thinking it's going to impact your revenue growth?"" Well, part of the reason is it's the things like I've just described where these are projects that we very discreetly decided to fund. They will naturally fall away. 
The other thing to keep in mind is that we feel we are making very good progress on our efforts to pool $1 billion out of the cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have said all along, sometimes to get to those ultimate positive outcomes, we actually have to spend some money, right? If you are automating things for a little while, you have to spend the money on automation before you can put the automation into place and take the cost out. If you are right showing things, you often have to duplicate teams in place for a little while until everything is running smoothly. 
In the back half of 2016, you have some of those added costs, actually, working against us. We are very comfortable, though, with the tracked and the line of sight we have into 2017. We feel very good about the progress we're making on costs. So that will be a significant benefit in 2017 versus what you will see in the back half of 2016. So those are the components that go into what we mean when we say we're at an elevated level of investments. It's going to elevate them a little bit more, and it helps you a little bit to think about the big moving pieces that help you get from the back half of 2016 to the EPS guidance we have given you for 2017, which, as we sit here today, I remain very comfortable with."

As we finish lapping that, you will actually see some, just due to that effect alone, modest decline in the U.S. consumer rates. That's something we anticipate and is consistent with all the plans we've laid out. Going against that, you have the efforts we have across our broad range of products to drive more billings through a range of efforts in the consumer segment. 
In the B2B segment, you have continued, as we talked about initially at Investor Day, to have the tail of a couple different segments of the market. We are seeing really nice growth in the small business and middle market area. And in fact, I would expect to see some acceleration in the middle market area, in particular, as we get in the back half of the year. The wildcard is in the largest corporate clients where, as we pointed out at Investor Day, that is not particularly a growth segment for us, and that continues to be a tough segment. I don't think there's many other Fortune 500 who are going on calls like we're having are right now and talking about growing their T&E budgets. And for us, in that large segment, we predominantly still have a T&E franchise. 
So we'll have to see how all those things play out. And of course, you have the whole range of external factors that I've talked about earlier that are a little hard to handicap, but those are a couple of discrete things that I would watch for."

On the expense side, the way I think about it is that there's a couple of big components of the expenses. So people costs are the largest single components, and they're now $315 million-or-so restructuring charges that we've taken, will get at a big chunk of the people savings. When you look at those restructuring charges, for the most part, those are for exits that occur over the course of 2016 with the overall inventory of them done by the end of 2016, but you don't necessarily really start seeing the savings until 2017. 
You have other components of costs, so there's a big professional fees component where we think we can get some savings. One of which is in the area of application development where we do a lot of outsourced work. Part of the elevated spending or elevated investment spending that we've been talking about is a lot of technological or technology development work that we think is going to be really valuable long term. That's the kind of stuff where we can actually dial it up even as we go through the back half of 2016 and very appropriately dial it down in 2017. Then you have a variety of other fees, renegotiated contracts, travel, all those kinds of things that constitute the remainder of the $1 billion. 
So while there are some savings that will begin to creep into the back half of 2017, mostly on the people side -- '16, excuse me, to a great extent, those are offset by some of the other costs I talked about earlier where we sometimes have to spend money to position ourselves to saving in 2017. So the net of all that is I feel very good about the progress we're making on the 2017 target, and we're working real hard to see just how much of it we can get quickly and early in 2017. And we'll obviously need to give you updates on that in future quarters, but I feel really good about the progress."

Let me take them in reverse, Chris. So the U.K., it is true that since the EU interchange regulations came into effect in early December, you have seen a couple of competitors pull back on some rewards, although it's not universal by any stretch of the imagination. What I would say is while that may help us over time, the really good growth rates we're seeing in the U.K. have actually been there for quite some time and predate any of those changes. So yes, look, we always say that regulation in our industry, we think, is generally not a good thing, not consumer-friendly and if so, it produces the best outcome. And regulation around interchange will not direct to be impacting us, does have an impact on balance is not a good thing. All that said, it does, at times, create opportunities. And the flexibility of our business model gives us a number of levers to pull to try to take advantage of different environments and different sets of regulation. So we'll have to see over time. We feel good about our value propositions in the U.K. We feel really good about the growth rates that we've had for quite some time. And if we could even accelerate those further, that would be a tremendous thing. 
In terms of the U.S., certainly, it's a competitive rewards environment. It has been for quite some time. I would have to say, I can't say that we've seen anything in the last 90 days that changes our view from what it would have been 90 days ago. And our broader strategy to compete in that environment, as you point out, Chris, is to have a wide range of value propositions because everybody's different. Everybody has something different they value. That's why we have co-brand products. We have cashback products. We have Membership Rewards products. We have fee-based products. We have multi-based products, et cetera, et cetera. And we think that kind of targeting allows us to deliver the most value to each customer segment in the most efficient way from a shareholder perspective. 
Now I would have to say, from our perspective, we are constantly innovating and evolving the Membership Rewards program, and we absolutely don't accept, just as a matter, of course, they don't -- we're going to have people who are trading out of Membership Rewards. We fight for the loyalty business and try to earn the business of everyone of our card numbers on an ongoing basis. And the breadth of the Membership Rewards program, our ability to integrate it with other merchants and other offers, we think, allows us to do some really innovative and unparalleled things that are very difficult for others to offer and match. And we think it's part of why we continue to see good growth in our Membership Rewards products, and we're able to do it while still being able to manage the costs in a reasonable way. So..."

So on balance, the sale of the Costco portfolio didn't have a material impact on our metrics other than the phenomenon I talked about in my prepared remarks, where because we retained a small amount, 250 million, 260 million of the canceled accounts, and those are heavily reserved, they impacted the delinquency rate by about 10 basis points this quarter, and they'll have a modest, probably similarly sized impact on the write-off rate in the next couple of quarters. 
Beyond that, what we laid out at our Investor Day was an expectation that you would see just because we're growing loans a lot, there's some seasoning of the portfolio, we expect that you would see some modest uptick in net write-off rates and then we painted some longer-term scenarios where we talked about maybe write-off rates going up 10, 20 basis points a year. We haven't seen that yet. The legacy parts of our portfolios, in most cases, continue to actually strengthen. And the loan growth that we've been doing, we've been doing while still maintaining a very similar credit profile to what we've had for years. If you look at our new card acquisitions this quarter, the FICO's average over 750 as they have for many, many quarters in the past. So there's not really a material change there. So look, I think we all are in the camp of saying, clearly, rates will go up. They have to go up at some point with seasonal lows. But we feel really good about the trajectory right now."

It's a good question, Craig. So a couple of things I'd say. As you -- I don't know exactly what calculation you're doing, but it is true that if you look at the competitive environment right now, like others on a lot of our lending products, there is some kind of introductory period where there is an interest-free period. When you suddenly, as you saw this quarter, lap off, in effect, all of the Costco loans, which were mature loans not in that intro period, the percentage of the remaining portfolio that is in that introductory period all of a sudden pops up compared to the combined portfolio before. Nothing has actually changed in terms of the dollar. I think you see the proportion change. And so you do see a little bit of that effect this quarter. One of the complex lapping dynamics that I was referring to earlier in my prepared remarks is as we go through the next couple of quarters, the lapping impact of all of -- some of the offers and the customer behavior around the new Amex cards we've put in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members, well, amongst other things, caused billings to trend down a little bit because we've had this surge -- adjusted billings to trend down a little bit. We've had this surge as we brought those card members on. It will also, though, have a very positive effect on net interest income and on revenue in a few quarters as we get the majority of those people past those introductory periods. So when you think very long term, what I would say is that the mix -- overall mix that we're offering to new and existing card members from an interest rate perspective is not considerably changing. This mixed effect that I just described, we will work through in the next couple of quarters as we finish lapping all the effects of the last 5-or-so quarters of some unusual dynamics around Costco. And once you're through all that, I wouldn't expect to see a material change in the prior trends."

But let me maybe make just a few comments. 
Certainly, our growth has been helped by the really nice progress we've made in the last 5 quarters on new card acquisitions. That growth manifests itself today particularly in the billings line. And then as the next couple of quarters roll by, that growth will increasingly move from the billings line into the loan balance and net interest income line as balances build for those who are revolvers, and it will grow into the revenue line as we lap various introductory incentives, et cetera. Now that general statement is part of why we have said for some time, although I guess I haven't repeated it today, now that I think about it, that as we get into the last quarter of 2016 in particular, we expect to see some sequential increase in revenue growth rates. And part of the complex lapping dynamics I was talking about earlier is we may feel a little bit of sequential weakening in the billings rate adjusted for Costco, but revenue will be going in the other direction as we get into the end of this year for all the reasons that you're asking about. 
So the other comment I would make is one of the things that Doug Buckminster, in particular, talked about at Investor Day is the fact that we have seen some modest share of wallet losses amongst our existing customers. And one of our key initiatives in the consumer business is around a range of things we're doing to try to change that trend. I feel really good about the things we're doing. What I would say is, it's a little early in the second quarter to say that they're actually having much of a material impact yet. I would say the second quarter is more impacted by what we've been doing around new card acquisitions. What I conclude from that is though, because I do feel good about those efforts, is I think that is something that you will see, the fruits of -- as we get into the coming quarters."

As interchange rates come down, we tend to keep our premium, but the premium sort to stays the same and we move down as interchange moves down. So anything that results in a sharp downward movement of interchange is generally going to have a tough or a follow-on impact on us."

We are laser-focused as a management team on getting back to the kind of consistent and fairly simple financial performance and financial model that drove this company for years. We are in an industry and with a business model that should allow us to get very consistent revenue growth. We have a heavily fixed cost nature, which allows us to get steady operating expense leverage on that, and we're not very capital-intensive so we get a bit of a capital kicker on top of that. 
We feel really good, and I think we've very consistently demonstrated that we made real good progress on running the cost structure of the company -- or more efficiently, and we're very committed to the use of the balance sheet. 
I think it's fair to say that in -- with the competitive economic and regulatory environment, what it's been, that is what has been a larger challenge for us, like many in the industry. Now as investors look at our results right now, there is a lot of complexity because of the evolution we're going through with Costco, and we're trying to sort through that complexity, but that complexity won't completely go away until you get all the way to the back half of 2017, which is when we will have to do all the various adjustments and try to help people understand the underlying trends. I would point out, though, that if you look at the first half 2016, you strip away Costco, you're at about 5% revenue growth. That's versus 4% last year. That 5% is benefiting a little bit from the Costco co-brand members who would put other Amex products in the hands-up. That's our jumping-off point and what we are very focused on as a management team. What we really tried to articulate at our Investor Day in March is our goal. Our belief is we can get that number up. In particular, our target is to get it to the 6% scenario that we showed you at Investor Day, and we have a wide range of initiatives across our consumer business, across our B2B business, in terms of how we're working with merchants, wide range of initiatives targeted at getting us there. 
I think what we are working hard to be able to demonstrate to you and to all of our shareholders is that we are getting real traction on those initiatives, and you can see it in our results as we get into 2017 because I think we fully appreciate that this is not just about the EPS we put out in 2017, but it's about the way we get that EPS and the momentum it gives us as you go beyond 2017 into 2018. So that's why we have a very simple mantra at the company right now for 50,000 people of -- and our priorities are accelerating revenue growth while we reset the cost base, while we be really focused about what we do with our investment followers. 
So in many ways, Bob, that's a great last question, and I think we'll probably going to stop there."

The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff."

Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale",3632,"Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio, a continued slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale, a $232 million restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts and an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking beyond these discrete items, our underlying results for the second quarter were solid and consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Investor Day in March for both 2016 and 2017. Excluding the impact from Costco-related volumes and FX, billings and adjusted revenue growth were generally consistent with recent quarters and our Investor Day expectations.
On the expense side. Provision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations as write-off rates have remained steady and growth in rewards has been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. While operating expenses were also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well controlled. And during the quarter, we continued to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders, including repurchasing $1.7 billion of outstanding shares. 
We also made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives.
In addition, we continued to make good progress on the steps needed to reduce our cost base by $1 billion, which drove the $232 million restructuring charge.
Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% year-over-year during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior year and increased 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19, and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition. Primarily due to the Costco-related impacts, we did see sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates versus the first quarter, in line with our expectations.
Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale, the majority of which held to the bottom line during the second quarter. The gain was offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives that we expect to maintain for all 4 quarters of 2016.
As I mentioned, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which, when combined with the $1.1 billion we repurchased in Q1, represents our highest-ever level of share buybacks over a 2-quarter period. This higher level of share repurchases helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count versus the prior year. 
Our net income for the quarter, combined with the decline in average shares outstanding, drove EPS of $2.10, which was 48% higher than the prior year.
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge was $2.26. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended June 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our performance metrics during Q2, starting with billed business on Slide 3. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth slowed sequentially to 4% during the quarter, driven by the decline in Costco-related volumes. Similar to last quarter, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 4. Billings growth adjusted for Costco and FX was consistent with the prior quarter at 8%, though I would remind you that Q1 included an extra day for leap year. 
To put this metric into context, I would also remind you that a portion of the new cards acquired in recent quarters relates to Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for a new Amex product. Our efforts around this began early last year and continued until the portfolio sale date. 
Although the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are pleased with the demand for our products and the success we've had in putting cards into the hands of former Costco co-brand card members, while, of course, closely following the terms of our agreements with Citi and Costco. 
We expect to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco co-brand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale. This spending is helping to provide a lift in the adjusted billings growth rate shown on Slide 4 and will create a number of lapping dynamics as we move forward.
Stepping back, the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio highlights the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape and why we have been adapting our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and accelerate growth. We plan to continue to aggressively pursue the full range of growth opportunities that we discussed at our Investor Day in March. These efforts cut across all our businesses, customer segments and geographies, including our initiatives to grow lending; our push towards parity coverage in the U.S.; our focus on accelerating growth in small business and middle market; continued strong growth outside the U.S.; and of course; our efforts to grow our consumer business in the U.S.; where there will be many complex market dynamics in coming quarters. These efforts all have the common goal of helping to accelerate the company's overall revenue growth, which is what we, as a management team, are focused on.
Going forward, while we will provide the adjusted billings and revenue performance of the company for the next 4 quarters, our focus will be on the outcomes of all of these efforts, not just the narrower performance around former Costco co-brand card members.
As we turn now to the segment and regional billings performance on slides 5 and 6, clearly, Costco had a significant impact on our U.S. results as well as on the performance of our USCS and GCS segments. Given that impact, I'll highlight a few of the other significant drivers of our billings performance during the quarter rather than reviewing the regions and segments individually.
Lower gas and airline ticket prices remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. International volumes continued to be strong, with FX-adjusted growth of 10%, and performance remained relatively consistent across most regions.
To turn to EMEA in particular, given the recent Brexit vote, I would remind you that the EMEA region constituted approximately 10% of our worldwide volumes in Q2. Our U.K. business constitutes 3% to 4% of worldwide billings, and it has been growing in excess of 10% in recent quarters. We did see a noticeable slowdown in this growth in the first several days immediately after the Brexit vote, but that growth has since rebounded to its prior strong levels.
From an FX perspective, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Like all companies with European operations, we are monitoring the situation closely to determine whether we will need to make any modifications to our business practices. At this point, we continue to operate as usual.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 '15, reflecting the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is slightly higher than the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry.
Now similar to my earlier comments on billings, I would point out that a portion of the loan growth in recent quarters comes as a result of our efforts to have former Costco co-brand card members sign up for another Amex product. 
Taking a step back, we have been pleased by our steady growth in loans for several years now, and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were down 1% but grew by 1% after adjusting for changes in FX. FX-adjusted revenue growth reflected increases in underlying billings and loans, offset by declines in Costco volumes and a decrease in the calculated discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount rate performance and the impact of Costco in a few minutes.
Turning first, though, to the other drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw a 7% increase in card fees versus the prior year. The growth was again driven in part by strong performance within our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios and is a clear indication that our value propositions continue to resonate in the marketplace. Net interest income increased by 2% during the quarter, though growth did slow sequentially versus the first quarter due primarily to the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios as well as the continued drop-off in Costco loans prior to the portfolio sale date in June. As we disclosed previously, the JetBlue co-brand portfolio constituted between 1% and 2% of our worldwide loan balances. 
Looking forward, and given all the recent uncertainty around forward interest rate expectations, I'd remind you that unlike most other banks, we benefit from lower interest rates and are negatively impacted by rising rates due primarily to the presence of our charge card portfolio.
To turn back now to the drivers of our discount rate and revenue performance. On Slide 9, we are again showing the trends in our reported and calculated discount rates. As expected, discount revenue growth during Q2 was impacted by a larger year-over-year decline in the reported discount rate than in Q1 due to the prior year merchant rebate accrual benefit.
On a year-to-date basis, the reported discount rate is down 6 basis points versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our 6- to 7-basis-point expectation from Investor Day.
Similar to last quarter, we are also seeing an impact on the discount rate from the continued expansion of OptBlue and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the EU that went into effect late last year. We do expect to see a much smaller drop in the reported discount rate during the second half of the year through to the end of the Costco relationship.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 10 basis points versus the prior year during Q2, driven in part by the 6-basis-point drop in the reported discount rate. As a reminder, a calculated rate is also influenced by contra revenue items, including cash rebates rewards, corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments as well as by growth in our GNS volumes. Growth and cash rebate rewards continues to make up the majority of the year-over-year change, driven primarily by our strong cash rebate card acquisitions and billings growth in recent quarters. 
I'll note that while this is driving increased contra revenues, we are seeing an offset in the rewards expense line, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in my remarks.
Moving now to Slide 10. We've included our estimate of Costco-related revenues. I'll remind you that there is some judgment involved with this estimate. Based on our analysis, we estimate that Costco-related revenues declined by approximately 32% versus last year during the quarter. Based on this estimate, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, slowed modestly on a sequential basis to 4% in Q2, driven primarily by the prior year discount rate benefit. On a year-to-date basis, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, has been about 5%, slightly above our exit rate for 2015.
As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on driving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of the year.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 11. Our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date basis and remain best in class amongst large issuer peers. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would begin to trend up a little bit given the seasoning of our loan portfolio. 
I would note that as part of the portfolio sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from the Costco co-brand portfolio, which related primarily to canceled accounts. These accounts are not expected to have a significant impact on provision as they are already reserved for at higher levels, but they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10% -- 10 basis points during Q2 and will impact our reported write-off rate over the next 2 quarters.
Turning to provision on Slide 12. Total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 '15, as you can see on the left side of the slide. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios were accounted for through a valuation allowance within operating expenses. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased by 13%, true to relatively consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance.
Consistent with our Investor Day comments, we expect that both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will contribute to an increase in provision going forward.
Turning then to expense performance on Slide 13. Total expenses decreased by 15% versus the prior year but were impacted by several discrete items. Excluding the Costco portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge in the current quarter, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% versus the prior year and continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking at the individual expense line, M&P was up 4% versus the prior year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of the key areas of focus for our investments, and we were pleased that these efforts drove 2.1 million new card acquisitions across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 3 million on a worldwide basis. 
As I mentioned, Costco co-brand card members signing up for new cards has been a key driver of the increased acquisitions in recent quarters, but we do expect acquisitions to slow somewhat during the second half of the year.
While we had previously expected, our total spending on growth initiatives during full year 2016 to be similar to 2015, we now expect to spend at a somewhat higher level. The increased spending will support a range of initiatives across the company, including some of the potential opportunities within the U.S. marketplace that I mentioned earlier. Our ultimate investment level will, of course, be driven by the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, but we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least $200 million above the 2015 level of $3.1 billion.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. Rewards expense decreased by 2% versus the prior year despite there being a 2% year-over-year increase in proprietary billings. This trend is being driven by a shift in volumes from products that have their rewards costs cast classified as an expense item such as Costco co-brand to products that have rewards reported as contra revenue items such as Cashback. Total rewards costs, including cash rebates, were up 1% in the current quarter, which is roughly in line with the growth in proprietary billings.
While it's a smaller expense line, cost of Card Member services increased by 16% versus the prior year. This line can be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter due to timing issues. But due to increased usage of some of the Card Member benefits that we've recently added, including new airport clubs and airline fee credits, I would expect it to be up around 10% for the full year.
Operating expenses were down 31% versus the prior year but were impacted by both the portfolio of sale gain and the restructuring charge. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, reflecting our strong focus on controlling costs.
We feel good about our progress, our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As a continuing part of that effort, we do expect to incur some additional restructuring charges in future quarters as we continue to roll out our plans, though I expect they will be smaller than what we incurred this quarter. We also anticipate that a portion of our increased investment spending will occur in operating expenses over the balance of 2016.
Turning last to capital on Slide 14. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we finished fully utilizing our 2015 CCAR authorization, repurchasing $6.6 billion of shares over the past 5 quarters, including $1.7 billion in the second quarter. 
As you recall, our 2015 CCAR submission included a higher level of net income than our actual performance since it assumed that our relationship with Costco would continue. However, given the performance of our underlying business and the benefits from the Costco portfolio of sale, we were still able to fully utilize our CCAR 2015 capacity while maintaining our strong capital ratios. 
We were also pleased with the 2016 CCAR results, which were released last month, as the Federal Reserve did not object to our CCAR 2016 plan to return up to $4.4 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next 4 quarters. These potential payouts are aligned with our Investor Day expectations and will enable us to provide a steady return of capital to our shareholders.
As you are all well aware, CCAR continues to be a very complex process. In general, capital plans are governed by the Fed modeling, which can have very different results from a bank's own expectations. For example, in the current year, the Fed assumes that our risk-weighted assets would increase in a severe stress scenario despite the loss of the Costco co-brand portfolio, which was very different from our own projections. I'd also highlight that we have the highest ROE amongst all the bank holding companies that go through the CCAR process. In combination with our high payout ratio, this result in a large reduction in capital levels over the CCAR period in a severely adverse scenario. 
For example, if we pay out 100% of base case net income, our capital ratios would be reduced by well over 50% in a severe stress scenario.
Thinking more broadly, the 2016 CCAR results once again highlighted the strength of our business model and balance sheet as we generated the highest net income amongst all bank holding companies in a severe stress scenario, and our capital ratios before the impact of capital actions were also in the top quartile.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage, and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focus on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
During the past 6 months, we have said that our full year 2016 outlook was for adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.70. We now believe that full year 2016 EPS will be at the high end of this range as our year-to-date performance has been better than our original expectations, driven largely by the favorability in our credit and expense performance. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Given that we're only halfway through 2016, our outlook for full year 2017 EPS to at least -- to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate that earnings will be lower during the second half of 2016 through the end of our relationship with Costco and the fact that we now expect to invest at higher levels during 2016 than we did in 2015.
As we have discussed several times, there is a bit more uncertainty around our second half 2016 assumptions. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have an updated view on the complex dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace as we progress through the balance of the year. And of course, we will update our guidance at the end of the third quarter.
We're focused on our plan to accelerate revenue growth, optimize investments and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Toby, and then we'll take your questions."

So I would say that's in the run rate, for the most part, in the second quarter. It continued to build even as we went through the second quarter and should stay in the run rate, subject to the complex dynamics, which I'll come to in a second. And I mentioned that 20% in the context of the disclosure we're making about our billings and revenue and, for that matter, loan growth rates, where we pull Costco out of the prior year base. Some of the growth does come from the efforts or the success we've had in putting other Amex products in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members. 
Complex dynamics. When you look at the back half of 2016, it's a -- certainly not news to anyone on this call, it's a very competitive environment right now. And you have many changes that are rocked by the switch from Amex to Citi of the Costco co-brand. You have many other competitors who have launched either new marketing efforts or new products that perhaps are targeted at some of the same types of card members. In our case, we have a range of marketing efforts targeted at lots of consumers and lots of different segments of the consumer world in the U.S., including the fact that the former Costco co-brand card members who just dropped into our broader prospect pool at this time who also, for us, have some complex dynamics around geographies and certain geographies where the Costco co-brand card members, for example, might have been a more significant part of total Amex cardholders. So all of those dynamics are complex. And then if you think about the broader external environment, you have tremendous uncertainty around interest rates. And I would point out to you, we, as we thought about this call, originally thought I might want to talk about the potential of lower rates. When you think about the last 24 hours, you've had the Fed sort of back-talking about higher rates. We'll have to see. Certainly, all of the election dynamics here in the U.S. and, for that matter, the dynamics in the U.K. and the EU probably create more uncertainty than we're used to. So I could go on, but I think you probably get the point that there's a lot of different changes going on that just make us this a little bit cautious so we've tried to be very balanced in the outlook that we've given you for the back half of 2016 and what that means for 2017, but we'll have to see where things really come out."

I think the first thing that's important to think about is we now, for several years, have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates, and we've done that while",401,"So just making a few notes here, Betsy, so I don't forget any parts of the question. I think the first thing that's important to think about is we now, for several years, have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates, and we've done that while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics and without seeing any significant increase in the credit metrics or changes in our overall risk profile. So there's a continuation of a trend. And that loan growth is coming from many different areas. We have a nice loan portfolio that's been growing steadily in our U.S. small business franchise open. We have a range of consumer products targeted at attracting more of our customers' borrowing behavior. And for us, because traditionally, and we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day in March, because traditionally, over the last probably 5, 6 years, we have probably underinvested in terms of our efforts to attract the borrowing behaviors of our own card members, both consumer and small business, as well as underinvested in terms of targeting prospects who, from a credit perspective, look just like our customers but are a little bit more revolving centric. As we have turned our efforts more to those kinds of customers, this is not trying to get more lending growth out of our existing customers -- or excuse me, out of customers where we were already tapping into our fair share of their lending behaviors. It's really, how do we tune our efforts to just attract an equivalent lending share to what we already have of our customers' spend share. So all of those efforts are what have led to the very steady performance you've seen. 
Now I think it is fair to say this quarter and last quarter, you're getting a little bit of an incremental boost that will fade in the next couple of quarters as we have moved some of the lending behaviors that were being done on the Costco co-brand cards onto other Amex products. And since you're looking at an adjusted number there where we've pulled all the Costco amount out of the base, that increases that 13% by a little bit. That will fade a little bit, but the broader trajectory, which we feel is a very thoughtful outcome of several years of steady effort in this area, we think that outcome will continue for the foreseeable future."

Those investments take many forms. Some of them are pure marketing and acquisition investments, some of them are technology investments that are about building capabilities and infrastructure. All of them are targeted at a mixture of very short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits. And as we look at our performance in the first half of the year where we've done a little bit better on expenses and provision than we expected and revenues are tracking as we expected, we felt very comfortable, even going to the higher end of our guidance range and increasing the investments a little bit. Our view of 2017, though, hasn't changed in that in 2017, our expectation would be that elevated level absolutely falls away and particularly, some of the capability building that we're funding here are projects that, very naturally, will fall away. A question I get a lot is, ""Gee, how can you consider a more significant decrease in this investment level without thinking it's going to impact your revenue growth?"" Well, part of the reason is it's the things like I just described where these are projects that we very discreetly decided to fund. They will naturally fall away. 
The other thing to keep in mind is that we feel we are making very good progress on our efforts to pull $1 billion out of the cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have said all along, sometimes to get to those ultimate positive outcomes, we actually have to spend some money, right? If you are automating things for a little while, you have to spend the money on automation before you can put the automation into place and take the cost out. If you are right shoring things, you often have to duplicate teams in place for a little while until everything is running smoothly. 
In the back half of 2016, you have some of those added costs, actually, working against us. We are very comfortable, though, with the tracked and the line of sight we have into 2017 and feel very good about the progress we're making on costs. So that will be a significant benefit in 2017 versus what you will see in the back half of 2016. So those are the components that go into what we mean when we say we're at an elevated level of investments going to elevate them a little bit more. Maybe that helps you a little bit think about the big moving pieces that help you get from the back half of 2016 to the EPS guidance we have given you for 2017, which, as we sit here today, I remain very comfortable with."

For the most part, I would think GMS, Eric, is just reflecting the entire company. And I think the nuances to think about here, and I'll talk about all of these numbers, taking Costco out of the base because it does affect both statements. In the consumer segment, you have had the biggest benefit from the phenomenon I described about the success we've had putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. 
As we finish lapping that, you will actually see some, just due to that effect alone, modest decline in the U.S. consumer rate. That's something we anticipate and is consistent with all the plans we've laid out. Going against that, you have the efforts we have across a broad range of products to drive more billings through a range of efforts in the consumer segment. 
In the B2B segment, you have continued, as we talked about initially at Investor Day, to have the tail of a couple different segments of the market. We are seeing really nice growth in the small business and middle market area. And in fact, I would expect to see some acceleration in the middle market area, in particular, as we get into the back half of the year. The wildcard is in the largest corporate clients where, as we pointed out at Investor Day, that is not particularly a growth segment for us, and that continues to be a tough segment. I don't think there's many of the Fortune 500 who are going on calls like we're having are right now and talking about growing their T&E budgets. And for us, in that large segment, we predominantly still have a T&E franchise. 
So we'll have to see how all those things play out. And of course, you have the whole range of external factors that I talked about earlier that are a little hard to handicap, but those are a couple of discrete things that I would watch for."

On marketing to Costco co-brand card members, I would remind you, we sold the portfolio and it's very different from our situation in Canada. So we no longer have any access or, for that matter, knowledge from a marketing perspective of the former Costco co-brand card members, unless they happen to have another Amex card. Now those people drop anonymously into the broader U.S. prospect pool that we constantly, as our competitors, are trying to target with attractive offers and attractive products but we can absolutely not do any direct marketing to those people at this point. 
On the expense side, the way I think about it is that there's a couple of big components of the expenses. So people costs are the largest single components, and they're now $315 million-or-so of restructuring charges that we've taken, will get at a big chunk of the people savings. When you look at those restructuring charges, for the most part, those are for exits that occur over the course of 2016 with the overall inventory of them done by the end of 2016, but you don't necessarily really start seeing the savings until 2017. 
You have other components of costs, so there's a big professional fees component where we think we can get some savings. One of which is in the area of application development where we do a lot of outsourced work. Part of the elevated spending or elevated investment spending that we've been talking about is a lot of technological or technology development work that we think is going to be really valuable long term. That's the kind of stuff where we can actually dial it up even as we go through the back half of 2016 and very abruptly dial it down in 2017. Then you have a variety of other fees, renegotiated contracts, travel, all those kinds of things that constitute the remainder of the $1 billion. 
So while there are some savings that will begin to creep into the back half of 2017, mostly on the people side -- '16, excuse me, to a great extent, those are offset by some of the other costs I talked about earlier where we sometimes have to spend money to position ourselves to saving in 2017. So the net of all that is I feel very good about the progress we're making on the 2017 target, and we're working real hard to see just how much of it we can get quickly and early in 2017. And we'll obviously need to give you updates on that in future quarters, but I feel really good about the progress."

Let me take them in reverse, Chris. So the U.K., it is true that since the EU interchange regulations came into effect in early December, you have seen a couple of competitors pull back on some rewards, although it's not universal by any stretch of the imagination. What I would say is while that may help us over time, the really good growth rates we're seeing in the U.K. have actually been there for quite some time and predate any of those changes. So look, we always say that regulation in our industry, we think, is generally not a good thing, not consumer-friendly, not necessary to produce the best outcome. And regulation around interchange will not direct to be impacting us, it does have an impact on balance -- not a good thing. All that said, it does, at times, create opportunities. And the flexibility of our business model gives us a number of levers to pull to try to take advantage of different environments and different sets of regulation. So we'll have to see over time. We feel good about our value proposition in the U.K. We feel really good about the growth rates that we've had for quite some time. And if we could even accelerate those further, that would be a tremendous thing. 
In terms of the U.S., certainly, it's a competitive rewards environment. It has been for quite some time. I would have to say, I can't say that we've seen anything in the last 90 days that changes our view from what it would have been 90 days ago. And our broader strategy to compete in that environment, as you point out, Chris, is to have a wide range of value propositions because everybody's different. Everybody has something different they value. That's why we have co-brand products. We have Cashback products. We have Membership Rewards products. We have fee-based products. We have no-fee-based products, et cetera, et cetera. And we think that kind of targeting allows us to deliver the most value to each customer segment in the most efficient way from a shareholder perspective. 
Now I would have to say, from our perspective, we are constantly innovating and evolving the Membership Rewards program, and we absolutely don't accept, just as a matter, of course, they don't -- we're going to have people who are trading out of Membership Rewards. We fight for the loyalty business and try to earn the business of every one of our card numbers on an ongoing basis. And the breadth of the Membership Rewards program, our ability to integrate it with other merchants and other offers, we think, allows us to do some really innovative and unparalleled things that are very difficult for others to offer and match. And we think it's part of why we continue to see good growth in our Membership Rewards products, and we're able to do it while still being able to manage the costs in a reasonable way. So..."

So on balance, the sale of the Costco portfolio didn't have a material impact on our metrics other than the phenomenon I talked about in my prepared remarks, where because we retained a small amount, 250 million, 260 million of the canceled accounts, and those are heavily reserved, they impacted the delinquency rate by about 10 basis points this quarter, and they'll have a modest, probably similarly sized impact on the write-off rate in the next couple of quarters. 
Beyond that, what we laid out at our Investor Day was an expectation that you would see just because we're growing loans a lot, there's some seasoning of the portfolio, we expect that you would see some modest uptick in net write-off rates and then we painted some longer-term scenarios where we talked about maybe write-off rates going up 10, 20 basis points a year. We haven't seen that yet. The legacy parts of our portfolios, in most cases, continue to actually strengthen. And the loan growth that we've been doing, we've been doing while still maintaining a very similar credit profile to what we've had for years. If you look at our new card acquisitions this quarter, the FICO's averaged over 750 as they have for many, many quarters in the past. There's not really a material change there. So look, I think we all are in the camp of saying, credit rates will go up. They have to go up at some point. We're at seasonal lows. But we feel pretty good about the trajectory right now."

It's a good question, Craig. So a couple of things, I'd say. As you -- I don't know exactly what calculation you're doing, but it is true that if you look at the competitive environment right now, like others on a lot of our lending products, there is some kind of introductory period where there is an interest-free period. When you suddenly, as you saw this quarter, lop off, in effect, all of the Costco loans, which were mature loans not in that intro period, the percentage of the remaining portfolio that is in that introductory period all of a sudden pops up compared to the combined portfolio before. Nothing has actually changed in terms of the dollar. I think you see the proportion change. And so you do see a little bit of that effect this quarter. One of the complex lapping dynamics that I was referring to earlier in my prepared remarks is as we go through the next couple of quarters, the lapping impact of all of -- some of the offers and the customer behavior around the new Amex cards we've put in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members, well, amongst other things, caused billings to trend down a little bit because we've had this surge -- adjusted billings to trend down a little bit. We've had this surge as we brought those card members on. It will also, though, have a very positive effect on net interest income and on revenue in a few quarters as we get the majority of those people past those introductory periods. So when you think very long term, what I would say is that the mix -- overall mix that we're offering to new and existing card members from an interest rate perspective is not considerably changing. This mixed effect that I just described, we will work through in the next couple quarters as we finish lapping all the effects of the last 5 or so quarters of some unusual dynamics around Costco. And once you're through all that, I wouldn't expect to see a material change in the prior trends."

But let me maybe make just a few comments. 
Certainly, our growth has been helped by the really nice progress we've made in the last 5 quarters on new card acquisitions. That growth manifests itself today particularly in the billings line. And then as the next couple of quarters roll by, that growth will increasingly move from the billings line into the loan balance and net interest income line as balances build for those who are revolvers, and it will grow into the revenue line as we lap various introductory incentives, et cetera. Now that general statement is part of why we have said for some time, although I guess I haven't repeated it today, now that I think about it, that as we get into the last quarter of 2016 in particular, we expect to see some sequential increase in revenue growth rates. And part of the complex lapping dynamics I was talking about earlier is we may see a little bit of sequential weakening in the billings rate adjusted for Costco, but revenue will be going in the other direction as we get into the end of this year for all the reasons that you're asking about. 
So the other comment I would make is one of the things that Doug Buckminster, in particular, talked about at Investor Day is the fact that we have seen some modest share of wallet losses amongst our existing customers. And one of our key initiatives in the consumer business is around a range of things we're doing to try to change that trend. I feel really good about the things we're doing. What I would say is, it's a little early in the second quarter to say that they're actually having much of a material impact yet. I would say the second quarter is more impacted by what we've been doing around new card acquisitions. What I conclude from that is though, because I do feel good about those efforts, is I think that is something that you will see the fruits of as we get into the coming quarters."

As interchange rates come down, we tend to keep our premium, but the premium sort of stays the same and we move down as interchange moves down. So anything that results in a sharp downward movement of interchange is generally going to have a tough or a follow-on impact on us."

We are laser-focused as a management team on getting back to the kind of consistent and fairly simple financial performance and financial model that drove this company for years. We are in an industry and with a business model that should allow us to get very consistent revenue growth. We have a heavily fixed cost nature, which allows us to get steady operating expense leverage on that, and we're not very capital-intensive so we get a bit of a capital kicker on top of that. 
We feel really good, and I think we've very consistently demonstrated that we made real good progress on running the cost structure of the company more efficiently, and we're very committed to the use of the balance sheet. 
I think it's fair to say that even with the competitive economic, regulatory environment, what it's been, that is what has been a larger challenge for us, like many in the industry. Now as investors look at our results right now, there is a lot of complexity because of the evolution we're going through with Costco, and we're trying to sort through that complexity, but that complexity won't completely go away until you get all the way to the back half of 2017, which is when we won't have to do all the various adjustments and try to help people understand the underlying trends. I would point out, though, that if you look at the first half 2016, you strip away Costco, you're at about 5% revenue growth. That's versus 4% last year. That 5% is benefiting a little bit from the Costco co-brand members who would put other Amex products in the hands-up. That's our jumping-off point and what we are very focused on as a management team. What we really tried to articulate at our Investor Day in March is our goal. Our belief is we can get that number up. In particular, our target is to get it to the 6% scenario that we showed you at Investor Day, and we have a wide range of initiatives across our consumer business, across our B2B business, in terms of how we're working with merchants, wide range of initiatives targeted at getting us there. 
I think what we are working hard to be able to demonstrate to you and to all of our shareholders is that we are getting real traction on those initiatives, and you can see it in our results as we get into 2017 because I think we fully appreciate that this is not just about the EPS we put out in 2017, but it's about the way we get that EPS and the momentum it gives us as you go beyond 2017 into 2018. So that's why we have a very simple mantra at the company right now for 50,000 people of -- and our priorities are accelerating revenue growth while we reset the cost base, while we be really focused about what we do with our investment followers. 
So in many ways, Bob, that's a great last question, and I think we'll probably going to stop there."

Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale",3632,"Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10, and as expected, included a number of discrete items creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pretax gain for the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio, a continued slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale, a $232 million restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts and an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking beyond these discrete items, our underlying results for the second quarter were solid and consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Investor Day in March for both 2016 and 2017. Excluding the impact from Costco-related volumes and FX, billings and adjusted revenue growth were generally consistent with recent quarters and our Investor Day expectations.
On the expense side. Provision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations as write-off rates have remained steady and growth in rewards has been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. While operating expenses were also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well controlled. And during the quarter, we continued to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders, including repurchasing $1.7 billion of outstanding shares. 
We also made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives.
In addition, we continued to make good progress on the steps needed to reduce our cost base by $1 billion, which drove the $232 million restructuring charge.
Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% year-over-year during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior year and increased 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19, and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition. Primarily due to the Costco-related impacts, we did see sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates versus the first quarter, in line with our expectations.
Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale, the majority of which held to the bottom line during the second quarter. The gain was offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives that we expect to maintain for all 4 quarters of 2016.
As I mentioned, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which, when combined with the $1.1 billion we repurchased in Q1, represents our highest-ever level of share buybacks over a 2-quarter period. This higher level of share repurchases helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count versus the prior year. 
Our net income for the quarter, combined with the decline in average shares outstanding, drove EPS of $2.10, which was 48% higher than the prior year.
Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge was $2.26. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended June 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our performance metrics during Q2, starting with billed business on Slide 3. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth slowed sequentially to 4% during the quarter, driven by the decline in Costco-related volumes. Similar to last quarter, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 4. Billings growth adjusted for Costco and FX was consistent with the prior quarter at 8%, though I would remind you that Q1 included an extra day for leap year. 
To put this metric into context, I would also remind you that a portion of the new cards acquired in recent quarters relates to Costco co-brand card members who have signed up for a new Amex product. Our efforts around this began early last year and continued until the portfolio sale date. 
Although the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are pleased with the demand for our products and the success we've had in putting cards into the hands of former Costco co-brand card members, while, of course, closely following the terms of our agreements with Citi and Costco. 
We expect to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco co-brand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale. This spending is helping to provide a lift in the adjusted billings growth rate shown on Slide 4 and will create a number of lapping dynamics as we move forward.
Stepping back, the sale of the Costco co-brand portfolio highlights the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape and why we have been adapting our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and accelerate growth. We plan to continue to aggressively pursue the full range of growth opportunities that we discussed at our Investor Day in March. These efforts cut across all our businesses, customer segments and geographies, including our initiatives to grow lending; our push towards parity coverage in the U.S.; our focus on accelerating growth in small business and middle market; continued strong growth outside the U.S.; and of course; our efforts to grow our consumer business in the U.S.; where there will be many complex market dynamics in coming quarters. These efforts all have the common goal of helping to accelerate the company's overall revenue growth, which is what we, as a management team, are focused on.
Going forward, while we will provide the adjusted billings and revenue performance of the company for the next 4 quarters, our focus will be on the outcomes of all of these efforts, not just the narrower performance around former Costco co-brand card members.
As we turn now to the segment and regional billings performance on slides 5 and 6, clearly, Costco had a significant impact on our U.S. results as well as on the performance of our USCS and GCS segments. Given that impact, I'll highlight a few of the other significant drivers of our billings performance during the quarter rather than reviewing the regions and segments individually.
Lower gas and airline ticket prices remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. International volumes continued to be strong, with FX-adjusted growth of 10%, and performance remained relatively consistent across most regions.
To turn to EMEA in particular, given the recent Brexit vote, I would remind you that the EMEA region constituted approximately 10% of our worldwide volumes in Q2. Our U.K. business constitutes 3% to 4% of worldwide billings, and it has been growing in excess of 10% in recent quarters. We did see a noticeable slowdown in this growth in the first several days immediately after the Brexit vote, but that growth has since rebounded to its prior strong levels.
From an FX perspective, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Like all companies with European operations, we are monitoring the situation closely to determine whether we will need to make any modifications to our business practices. At this point, we continue to operate as usual.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 '15, reflecting the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is slightly higher than the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry.
Now similar to my earlier comments on billings, I would point out that a portion of the loan growth in recent quarters comes as a result of our efforts to have former Costco co-brand card members sign up for another Amex product. 
Taking a step back, we have been pleased by our steady growth in loans for several years now, and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 8. Reported revenues were down 1% but grew by 1% after adjusting for changes in FX. FX-adjusted revenue growth reflected increases in underlying billings and loans, offset by declines in Costco volumes and a decrease in the calculated discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount rate performance and the impact of Costco in a few minutes.
Turning first, though, to the other drivers of revenue growth in the quarter. We saw a 7% increase in card fees versus the prior year. The growth was again driven in part by strong performance within our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios and is a clear indication that our value propositions continue to resonate in the marketplace. Net interest income increased by 2% during the quarter, though growth did slow sequentially versus the first quarter due primarily to the sales of the Costco and JetBlue co-brand portfolios as well as the continued drop-off in Costco loans prior to the portfolio sale date in June. As we disclosed previously, the JetBlue co-brand portfolio constituted between 1% and 2% of our worldwide loan balances. 
Looking forward, and given all the recent uncertainty around forward interest rate expectations, I'd remind you that unlike most other banks, we benefit from lower interest rates and are negatively impacted by rising rates due primarily to the presence of our charge card portfolio.
To turn back now to the drivers of our discount rate and revenue performance. On Slide 9, we are again showing the trends in our reported and calculated discount rates. As expected, discount revenue growth during Q2 was impacted by a larger year-over-year decline in the reported discount rate than in Q1 due to the prior year merchant rebate accrual benefit.
On a year-to-date basis, the reported discount rate is down 6 basis points versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our 6- to 7-basis-point expectation from Investor Day.
Similar to last quarter, we are also seeing an impact on the discount rate from the continued expansion of OptBlue and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the EU that went into effect late last year. We do expect to see a much smaller drop in the reported discount rate during the second half of the year through to the end of the Costco relationship.
Coming back to the calculated discount rate. It was down 10 basis points versus the prior year during Q2, driven in part by the 6-basis-point drop in the reported discount rate. As a reminder, a calculated rate is also influenced by contra revenue items, including cash rebates rewards, corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments as well as by growth in our GNS volumes. Growth and cash rebate rewards continues to make up the majority of the year-over-year change, driven primarily by our strong cash rebate card acquisitions and billings growth in recent quarters. 
I'll note that while this is driving increased contra revenues, we are seeing an offset in the rewards expense line, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in my remarks.
Moving now to Slide 10. We've included our estimate of Costco-related revenues. I'll remind you that there is some judgment involved with this estimate. Based on our analysis, we estimate that Costco-related revenues declined by approximately 32% versus last year during the quarter. Based on this estimate, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, slowed modestly on a sequential basis to 4% in Q2, driven primarily by the prior year discount rate benefit. On a year-to-date basis, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, has been about 5%, slightly above our exit rate for 2015.
As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on driving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of the year.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 11. Our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date basis and remain best in class amongst large issuer peers. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would begin to trend up a little bit given the seasoning of our loan portfolio. 
I would note that as part of the portfolio sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from the Costco co-brand portfolio, which related primarily to canceled accounts. These accounts are not expected to have a significant impact on provision as they are already reserved for at higher levels, but they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10% -- 10 basis points during Q2 and will impact our reported write-off rate over the next 2 quarters.
Turning to provision on Slide 12. Total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 '15, as you can see on the left side of the slide. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios were accounted for through a valuation allowance within operating expenses. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased by 13%, true to relatively consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance.
Consistent with our Investor Day comments, we expect that both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will contribute to an increase in provision going forward.
Turning then to expense performance on Slide 13. Total expenses decreased by 15% versus the prior year but were impacted by several discrete items. Excluding the Costco portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge in the current quarter, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% versus the prior year and continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending.
Looking at the individual expense line, M&P was up 4% versus the prior year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of the key areas of focus for our investments, and we were pleased that these efforts drove 2.1 million new card acquisitions across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 3 million on a worldwide basis. 
As I mentioned, Costco co-brand card members signing up for new cards has been a key driver of the increased acquisitions in recent quarters, but we do expect acquisitions to slow somewhat during the second half of the year.
While we had previously expected, our total spending on growth initiatives during full year 2016 to be similar to 2015, we now expect to spend at a somewhat higher level. The increased spending will support a range of initiatives across the company, including some of the potential opportunities within the U.S. marketplace that I mentioned earlier. Our ultimate investment level will, of course, be driven by the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, but we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least $200 million above the 2015 level of $3.1 billion.
Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance. Rewards expense decreased by 2% versus the prior year despite there being a 2% year-over-year increase in proprietary billings. This trend is being driven by a shift in volumes from products that have their rewards costs cast classified as an expense item such as Costco co-brand to products that have rewards reported as contra revenue items such as Cashback. Total rewards costs, including cash rebates, were up 1% in the current quarter, which is roughly in line with the growth in proprietary billings.
While it's a smaller expense line, cost of Card Member services increased by 16% versus the prior year. This line can be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter due to timing issues. But due to increased usage of some of the Card Member benefits that we've recently added, including new airport clubs and airline fee credits, I would expect it to be up around 10% for the full year.
Operating expenses were down 31% versus the prior year but were impacted by both the portfolio of sale gain and the restructuring charge. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, reflecting our strong focus on controlling costs.
We feel good about our progress, our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As a continuing part of that effort, we do expect to incur some additional restructuring charges in future quarters as we continue to roll out our plans, though I expect they will be smaller than what we incurred this quarter. We also anticipate that a portion of our increased investment spending will occur in operating expenses over the balance of 2016.
Turning last to capital on Slide 14. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we finished fully utilizing our 2015 CCAR authorization, repurchasing $6.6 billion of shares over the past 5 quarters, including $1.7 billion in the second quarter. 
As you recall, our 2015 CCAR submission included a higher level of net income than our actual performance since it assumed that our relationship with Costco would continue. However, given the performance of our underlying business and the benefits from the Costco portfolio of sale, we were still able to fully utilize our CCAR 2015 capacity while maintaining our strong capital ratios. 
We were also pleased with the 2016 CCAR results, which were released last month, as the Federal Reserve did not object to our CCAR 2016 plan to return up to $4.4 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next 4 quarters. These potential payouts are aligned with our Investor Day expectations and will enable us to provide a steady return of capital to our shareholders.
As you are all well aware, CCAR continues to be a very complex process. In general, capital plans are governed by the Fed modeling, which can have very different results from a bank's own expectations. For example, in the current year, the Fed assumes that our risk-weighted assets would increase in a severe stress scenario despite the loss of the Costco co-brand portfolio, which was very different from our own projections. I'd also highlight that we have the highest ROE amongst all the bank holding companies that go through the CCAR process. In combination with our high payout ratio, this result in a large reduction in capital levels over the CCAR period in a severely adverse scenario. 
For example, if we pay out 100% of base case net income, our capital ratios would be reduced by well over 50% in a severe stress scenario.
Thinking more broadly, the 2016 CCAR results once again highlighted the strength of our business model and balance sheet as we generated the highest net income amongst all bank holding companies in a severe stress scenario, and our capital ratios before the impact of capital actions were also in the top quartile.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage, and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focus on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
During the past 6 months, we have said that our full year 2016 outlook was for adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.70. We now believe that full year 2016 EPS will be at the high end of this range as our year-to-date performance has been better than our original expectations, driven largely by the favorability in our credit and expense performance. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Given that we're only halfway through 2016, our outlook for full year 2017 EPS to at least -- to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate that earnings will be lower during the second half of 2016 through the end of our relationship with Costco and the fact that we now expect to invest at higher levels during 2016 than we did in 2015.
As we have discussed several times, there is a bit more uncertainty around our second half 2016 assumptions. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have an updated view on the complex dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace as we progress through the balance of the year. And of course, we will update our guidance at the end of the third quarter.
We're focused on our plan to accelerate revenue growth, optimize investments and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Toby, and then we'll take your questions."

So I would say that's in the run rate, for the most part, in the second quarter. It continued to build even as we went through the second quarter and should stay in the run rate, subject to the complex dynamics, which I'll come to in a second. And I mentioned that 20% in the context of the disclosure we're making about our billings and revenue and, for that matter, loan growth rates, where we pull Costco out of the prior year base. Some of the growth does come from the efforts or the success we've had in putting other Amex products in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members. 
Complex dynamics. When you look at the back half of 2016, it's a -- certainly not news to anyone on this call, it's a very competitive environment right now. And you have many changes that are rocked by the switch from Amex to Citi of the Costco co-brand. You have many other competitors who have launched either new marketing efforts or new products that perhaps are targeted at some of the same types of card members. In our case, we have a range of marketing efforts targeted at lots of consumers and lots of different segments of the consumer world in the U.S., including the fact that the former Costco co-brand card members who just dropped into our broader prospect pool at this time who also, for us, have some complex dynamics around geographies and certain geographies where the Costco co-brand card members, for example, might have been a more significant part of total Amex cardholders. So all of those dynamics are complex. And then if you think about the broader external environment, you have tremendous uncertainty around interest rates. And I would point out to you, we, as we thought about this call, originally thought I might want to talk about the potential of lower rates. When you think about the last 24 hours, you've had the Fed sort of back-talking about higher rates. We'll have to see. Certainly, all of the election dynamics here in the U.S. and, for that matter, the dynamics in the U.K. and the EU probably create more uncertainty than we're used to. So I could go on, but I think you probably get the point that there's a lot of different changes going on that just make us this a little bit cautious so we've tried to be very balanced in the outlook that we've given you for the back half of 2016 and what that means for 2017, but we'll have to see where things really come out."

I think the first thing that's important to think about is we now, for several years, have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates, and we've done that while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics and without seeing any significant increase in the credit metrics or changes in our overall risk profile. So there's a continuation of a trend. And that loan growth is coming from many different areas. We have a nice loan portfolio that's been growing steadily in our U.S. small business franchise open. We have a range of consumer products targeted at attracting more of our customers' borrowing behavior. And for us, because traditionally, and we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day in March, because traditionally, over the last probably 5, 6 years, we have probably underinvested in terms of our efforts to attract the borrowing behaviors of our own card members, both consumer and small business, as well as underinvested in terms of targeting prospects who, from a credit perspective, look just like our customers but are a little bit more revolving centric. As we have turned our efforts more to those kinds of customers, this is not trying to get more lending growth out of our existing customers -- or excuse me, out of customers where we were already tapping into our fair share of their lending behaviors. It's really, how do we tune our efforts to just attract an equivalent lending share to what we already have of our customers' spend share. So all of those efforts are what have led to the very steady performance you've seen. 
Now I think it is fair to say this quarter and last quarter, you're getting a little bit of an incremental boost that will fade in the next couple of quarters as we have moved some of the lending behaviors that were being done on the Costco co-brand cards onto other Amex products. And since you're looking at an adjusted number there where we've pulled all the Costco amount out of the base, that increases that 13% by a little bit. That will fade a little bit, but the broader trajectory, which we feel is a very thoughtful outcome of several years of steady effort in this area, we think that outcome will continue for the foreseeable future."

That's a really good and, I think, important question, Chris. So a couple of comments. The investment piece to start with, as you point out, we have made a decision that as we look at all of the complex market dynamics, which I just talked about in response to the last question, we're going to increase somewhat in the second half of the year and increase for full year 2016 over 2015 our overall level of investments. Those investments take many forms. Some of them are pure marketing and acquisition investments, some of them are technology investments that are about building capabilities and infrastructure. All of them are targeted at a mixture of very short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits. And as we look at our performance in the first half of the year where we've done a little bit better on expenses and provision than we expected and revenues are tracking as we expected, we felt very comfortable, even going to the higher end of our guidance range and increasing the investments a little bit. Our view of 2017, though, hasn't changed in that in 2017, our expectation would be that elevated level absolutely falls away and particularly, some of the capability building that we're funding here are projects that, very naturally, will fall away. A question I get a lot is, ""Gee, how can you consider a more significant decrease in this investment level without thinking it's going to impact your revenue growth?"" Well, part of the reason is it's the things like I just described where these are projects that we very discreetly decided to fund. They will naturally fall away. 
The other thing to keep in mind is that we feel we are making very good progress on our efforts to pull $1 billion out of the cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have said all along, sometimes to get to those ultimate positive outcomes, we actually have to spend some money, right? If you are automating things for a little while, you have to spend the money on automation before you can put the automation into place and take the cost out. If you are right shoring things, you often have to duplicate teams in place for a little while until everything is running smoothly. 
In the back half of 2016, you have some of those added costs, actually, working against us. We are very comfortable, though, with the tracked and the line of sight we have into 2017 and feel very good about the progress we're making on costs. So that will be a significant benefit in 2017 versus what you will see in the back half of 2016. So those are the components that go into what we mean when we say we're at an elevated level of investments going to elevate them a little bit more. Maybe that helps you a little bit think about the big moving pieces that help you get from the back half of 2016 to the EPS guidance we have given you for 2017, which, as we sit here today, I remain very comfortable with."

For the most part, I would think GMS, Eric, is just reflecting the entire company. And I think the nuances to think about here, and I'll talk about all of these numbers, taking Costco out of the base because it does affect both statements. In the consumer segment, you have had the biggest benefit from the phenomenon I described about the success we've had putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco co-brand card members. 
As we finish lapping that, you will actually see some, just due to that effect alone, modest decline in the U.S. consumer rate. That's something we anticipate and is consistent with all the plans we've laid out. Going against that, you have the efforts we have across a broad range of products to drive more billings through a range of efforts in the consumer segment. 
In the B2B segment, you have continued, as we talked about initially at Investor Day, to have the tail of a couple different segments of the market. We are seeing really nice growth in the small business and middle market area. And in fact, I would expect to see some acceleration in the middle market area, in particular, as we get into the back half of the year. The wildcard is in the largest corporate clients where, as we pointed out at Investor Day, that is not particularly a growth segment for us, and that continues to be a tough segment. I don't think there's many of the Fortune 500 who are going on calls like we're having are right now and talking about growing their T&E budgets. And for us, in that large segment, we predominantly still have a T&E franchise. 
So we'll have to see how all those things play out. And of course, you have the whole range of external factors that I talked about earlier that are a little hard to handicap, but those are a couple of discrete things that I would watch for."

On marketing to Costco co-brand card members, I would remind you, we sold the portfolio and it's very different from our situation in Canada. So we no longer have any access or, for that matter, knowledge from a marketing perspective of the former Costco co-brand card members, unless they happen to have another Amex card. Now those people drop anonymously into the broader U.S. prospect pool that we constantly, as our competitors, are trying to target with attractive offers and attractive products but we can absolutely not do any direct marketing to those people at this point. 
On the expense side, the way I think about it is that there's a couple of big components of the expenses. So people costs are the largest single components, and they're now $315 million-or-so of restructuring charges that we've taken, will get at a big chunk of the people savings. When you look at those restructuring charges, for the most part, those are for exits that occur over the course of 2016 with the overall inventory of them done by the end of 2016, but you don't necessarily really start seeing the savings until 2017. 
You have other components of costs, so there's a big professional fees component where we think we can get some savings. One of which is in the area of application development where we do a lot of outsourced work. Part of the elevated spending or elevated investment spending that we've been talking about is a lot of technological or technology development work that we think is going to be really valuable long term. That's the kind of stuff where we can actually dial it up even as we go through the back half of 2016 and very abruptly dial it down in 2017. Then you have a variety of other fees, renegotiated contracts, travel, all those kinds of things that constitute the remainder of the $1 billion. 
So while there are some savings that will begin to creep into the back half of 2017, mostly on the people side -- '16, excuse me, to a great extent, those are offset by some of the other costs I talked about earlier where we sometimes have to spend money to position ourselves to saving in 2017. So the net of all that is I feel very good about the progress we're making on the 2017 target, and we're working real hard to see just how much of it we can get quickly and early in 2017. And we'll obviously need to give you updates on that in future quarters, but I feel really good about the progress."

Let me take them in reverse, Chris. So the U.K., it is true that since the EU interchange regulations came into effect in early December, you have seen a couple of competitors pull back on some rewards, although it's not universal by any stretch of the imagination. What I would say is while that may help us over time, the really good growth rates we're seeing in the U.K. have actually been there for quite some time and predate any of those changes. So look, we always say that regulation in our industry, we think, is generally not a good thing, not consumer-friendly, not necessary to produce the best outcome. And regulation around interchange will not direct to be impacting us, it does have an impact on balance -- not a good thing. All that said, it does, at times, create opportunities. And the flexibility of our business model gives us a number of levers to pull to try to take advantage of different environments and different sets of regulation. So we'll have to see over time. We feel good about our value proposition in the U.K. We feel really good about the growth rates that we've had for quite some time. And if we could even accelerate those further, that would be a tremendous thing. 
In terms of the U.S., certainly, it's a competitive rewards environment. It has been for quite some time. I would have to say, I can't say that we've seen anything in the last 90 days that changes our view from what it would have been 90 days ago. And our broader strategy to compete in that environment, as you point out, Chris, is to have a wide range of value propositions because everybody's different. Everybody has something different they value. That's why we have co-brand products. We have Cashback products. We have Membership Rewards products. We have fee-based products. We have no-fee-based products, et cetera, et cetera. And we think that kind of targeting allows us to deliver the most value to each customer segment in the most efficient way from a shareholder perspective. 
Now I would have to say, from our perspective, we are constantly innovating and evolving the Membership Rewards program, and we absolutely don't accept, just as a matter, of course, they don't -- we're going to have people who are trading out of Membership Rewards. We fight for the loyalty business and try to earn the business of every one of our card numbers on an ongoing basis. And the breadth of the Membership Rewards program, our ability to integrate it with other merchants and other offers, we think, allows us to do some really innovative and unparalleled things that are very difficult for others to offer and match. And we think it's part of why we continue to see good growth in our Membership Rewards products, and we're able to do it while still being able to manage the costs in a reasonable way. So..."

Beyond that, what we laid out at our Investor Day was an expectation that you would see just because we're growing loans a lot, there's some seasoning of the portfolio, we expect that you would see some modest uptick in net write-off rates and then we painted some longer-term scenarios where we talked about maybe write-off rates going up 10, 20 basis points a year. We haven't seen that yet. The legacy parts of our portfolios, in most cases, continue to actually strengthen. And the loan growth that we've been doing, we've been doing while still maintaining a very similar credit profile to what we've had for years. If you look at our new card acquisitions this quarter, the FICO's averaged over 750 as they have for many, many quarters in the past. There's not really a material change there.

It's a good question, Craig. So a couple of things, I'd say. As you -- I don't know exactly what calculation you're doing, but it is true that if you look at the competitive environment right now, like others on a lot of our lending products, there is some kind of introductory period where there is an interest-free period. When you suddenly, as you saw this quarter, lop off, in effect, all of the Costco loans, which were mature loans not in that intro period, the percentage of the remaining portfolio that is in that introductory period all of a sudden pops up compared to the combined portfolio before. Nothing has actually changed in terms of the dollar. I think you see the proportion change. And so you do see a little bit of that effect this quarter. One of the complex lapping dynamics that I was referring to earlier in my prepared remarks is as we go through the next couple of quarters, the lapping impact of all of -- some of the offers and the customer behavior around the new Amex cards we've put in the hands of the Costco co-brand card members, well, amongst other things, caused billings to trend down a little bit because we've had this surge -- adjusted billings to trend down a little bit. We've had this surge as we brought those card members on. It will also, though, have a very positive effect on net interest income and on revenue in a few quarters as we get the majority of those people past those introductory periods. So when you think very long term, what I would say is that the mix -- overall mix that we're offering to new and existing card members from an interest rate perspective is not considerably changing. This mixed effect that I just described, we will work through in the next couple quarters as we finish lapping all the effects of the last 5 or so quarters of some unusual dynamics around Costco. And once you're through all that, I wouldn't expect to see a material change in the prior trends."

But l",389,"So that's a good and very complex question, Sanjay, because, of course, the dynamics are a little different, whether you're talking about a consumer lending card, consumer charge card, an open small business card or new Corporate Card relationships. But let me maybe make just a few comments. 
Certainly, our growth has been helped by the really nice progress we've made in the last 5 quarters on new card acquisitions. That growth manifests itself today particularly in the billings line. And then as the next couple of quarters roll by, that growth will increasingly move from the billings line into the loan balance and net interest income line as balances build for those who are revolvers, and it will grow into the revenue line as we lap various introductory incentives, et cetera. Now that general statement is part of why we have said for some time, although I guess I haven't repeated it today, now that I think about it, that as we get into the last quarter of 2016 in particular, we expect to see some sequential increase in revenue growth rates. And part of the complex lapping dynamics I was talking about earlier is we may see a little bit of sequential weakening in the billings rate adjusted for Costco, but revenue will be going in the other direction as we get into the end of this year for all the reasons that you're asking about. 
So the other comment I would make is one of the things that Doug Buckminster, in particular, talked about at Investor Day is the fact that we have seen some modest share of wallet losses amongst our existing customers. And one of our key initiatives in the consumer business is around a range of things we're doing to try to change that trend. I feel really good about the things we're doing. What I would say is, it's a little early in the second quarter to say that they're actually having much of a material impact yet. I would say the second quarter is more impacted by what we've been doing around new card acquisitions. What I conclude from that is though, because I do feel good about those efforts, is I think that is something that you will see the fruits of as we get into the coming quarters."

So anything that results in a sharp downward movement of interchange is generally going to have a tough or a follow-on impact on us."

We are laser-focused as a management team on getting back to the kind of consistent and fairly simple financial performance and financial model that drove this company for years. We are in an industry and with a business model that should allow us to get very consistent revenue growth. We have a heavily fixed cost nature, which allows us to get steady operating expense leverage on that, and we're not very capital-intensive so we get a bit of a capital kicker on top of that. 
We feel really good, and I think we've very consistently demonstrated that we made real good progress on running the cost structure of the company more efficiently, and we're very committed to the use of the balance sheet. 
I think it's fair to say that even with the competitive economic, regulatory environment, what it's been, that is what has been a larger challenge for us, like many in the industry. Now as investors look at our results right now, there is a lot of complexity because of the evolution we're going through with Costco, and we're trying to sort through that complexity, but that complexity won't completely go away until you get all the way to the back half of 2017, which is when we won't have to do all the various adjustments and try to help people understand the underlying trends. I would point out, though, that if you look at the first half 2016, you strip away Costco, you're at about 5% revenue growth. That's versus 4% last year. That 5% is benefiting a little bit from the Costco co-brand members who would put other Amex products in the hands-up. That's our jumping-off point and what we are very focused on as a management team. What we really tried to articulate at our Investor Day in March is our goal. Our belief is we can get that number up. In particular, our target is to get it to the 6% scenario that we showed you at Investor Day, and we have a wide range of initiatives across our consumer business, across our B2B business, in terms of how we're working with merchants, wide range of initiatives targeted at getting us there. 
I think what we are working hard to be able to demonstrate to you and to all of our shareholders is that we are getting real traction on those initiatives, and you can see it in our results as we get into 2017 because I think we fully appreciate that this is not just about the EPS we put out in 2017, but it's about the way we get that EPS and the momentum it gives us as you go beyond 2017 into 2018. So that's why we have a very simple mantra at the company right now for 50,000 people of -- and our priorities are accelerating revenue growth while we reset the cost base, while we be really focused about what we do with our investment followers. 
So in many ways, Bob, that's a great last question, and I think we'll probably going to stop there."

As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which is 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter, and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.
The favorability was driven by faster-than-anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we've discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter and the [ph] overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally, we continue to use our capital strengths to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. 
Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals' decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. I'd like to point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.
The progress we've made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively into [ph] Q4 with a number of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. This includes a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. 
In addition, we're going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new cardmembers this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.
With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter.
In support of this, we're planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead.
I highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term.
Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. The revenues decreased by 5%, reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I'd note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter, the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses. 
We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count.
This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include the restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost-reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last 2 quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.
We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remained healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remained strong, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter.
We're also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products.
Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which enacted [ph] our year-over-year growth rates. the largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter.
And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost-reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.
Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX-adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an uptick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks are in on spending within the industry [ph]. 
Within the EMEA region, our U.K. business continues to perform very well with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 '15, reflecting the sales of the 2 cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold cobrand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX.
On this basis, adjusted worldwide loans growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects. 
Over the last 2 years, as our cobrand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-cobrand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, but they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mixed change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile, and it is producing good returns.
Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influenced this change. The sold cobrand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-cobrand card member launch to which our mix has shifted had a higher [ph] yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year.
Turning to provision on Slide 8. Total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 '15 related to the 2 cobrand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6%, however, is a combination of 2 different trends [ph]. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low.
Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages [ph].
Turning to our reported lending credit metrics. I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among large peer issuers.
Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I'd emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook, and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9. Reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March.
As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes.
Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico.
Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee-paying customers even in the phase of an intense competitive environment.
Moving on. Net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12%, and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year.
Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we've seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the cobrand portfolios.
Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11. We saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchants' negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue.
We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business moved down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from [ph] Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS, or network business in Q3, as cobrand volumes declined.
Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12. You can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards.
Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from cobrand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue.
Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco cobrand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter.
Looking forward, however, and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.
Turning then to operating expenses. We continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.
Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. I'd remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion [ph]. On last quarter's earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses will be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. 
As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas, and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters.
Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we've had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. We are excited about the changes announced earlier this month [ph], which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year.
Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed. 
Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increase brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants.
We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond.
As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially, and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 close [ph]. 
Moving now to capital. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
So let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history, we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results.
On last quarter's earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.
Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity, combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance, offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed, would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Turning to 2017. Our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster-than-expected progress on our cost-reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see at the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost-reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.
We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer-term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place."

We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can't. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer-term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we're after. Now what is the rising interest rate environment as mean for that? Well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us, all else being equal, rising interest rates are -- cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions, and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will drive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment [indiscernible] rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we'll have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment."

What I would say is that we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high end cards, and that's the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion lounges to expansion of various travel-oriented credits around TSA Precheck and Global Entry, through status that we're able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilson honors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things, and there's a lot of thought and a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more. So none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They're all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match."

When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year, and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I'd start there and say we feel pretty good about that franchise, and it's part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about a particularly good growth we've seen in the U.S. consumer space with our cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we'll have to -- it's far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there's -- I said a few minutes ago, we're in the game for the very long term to go long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways, we've built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second, we've had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value, financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what's happening with overall market share. But I would say our #1 goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we're not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we've lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S., we've been gaining share in almost every market in which we operate. But I would close by saying our #1 objective though is making the right decisions to build sustainable financial value."

On 2017, expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into 3 categories: Operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario, and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I'm telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we've made in identifying and executing in a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we'll have to see but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that and we're continuing to work every day to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We'll have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent that we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario, both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I'm certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn't continue every day to be a very, very competitive environment. So our M&P probably come somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much. Rewards is certainly a moving target because it's a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our cashback co-brand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I'll tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we've seen the last few quarters where neutral rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings, that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you that we've been planning that for some time. That's why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we should throughout [indiscernible] half [ph] and beyond [ph], we have assumed that rewards costs overall faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I'm probably going to wait 1 more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that, and the Q4 results I think will help everyone begin to calibrate as well."

You hear us talk about many different advantages about having a closed loop model gives us, and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact every day we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And every day, we've got to demonstrate our value to card members.

So we're pleased with that, and we're working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone, however, that there in the near term an offset, which we talked about when we talked about the discount rates, is that we are in a multiyear process, probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar and [indiscernible] the breakdown, and that's part of what we've been talking about for some time now.

It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you're in and the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers, and that was a very low-cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to to 2 good brands. So we have lost that. One of the things internally that we did -- do look at that are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that, and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now, even though we lost that one big former channel, were above what they were in the prior year, and we feel good about that mix. I would say though that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year, and that's going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question."

I'd remind, Moshe, you and for everyone, as we resegmented the company after '10 [ph], reorganized the company late last year, we created the 4 new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anre Williams [ph] represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the -- what we call the GNS or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity co-brands. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most card part because most of those are relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GNS segment, quite frankly, it's really going to attract the overall company because what you're really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer in commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we're calling ICNS, or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be of the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I'd say is the GNS segment really just reflects the overall company economics, and I'm not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GNS or network business, we continue to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I'd say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity, and that would be one thing that I would say as not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near term. But outside the U.S., we see veery nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question."

Okay, I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our co-brand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those co-brand card members with non-co-brand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-co-brand card members are more likely to result -- revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the co-brand card members. We priced for that. That's part of why as I went to the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you're losing the lower-yielding co-brand card members and you're gaining more non-co-brand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that's the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning because you go through a process over the first year or 2 that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the 2 things going on that had led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we've been growing them for a very long time, and we think we can do without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I'd also just remind you, the other reason that we've been able to do that for some years now because remember, it's not -- we didn't just accelerate our loan growth. It's been well above the industry for several years now, and you haven't seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we're just focused on it now, and we're creating the products that are attractive to consumers scenario. We're creating marketing that actually drives people to the product and could we just have more focus on it here asset management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target-rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that's a key difference, I think, Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we thought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn't have to figure out we're already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members? We had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say, well, what do we do to start trimming our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunities set than others may have, and I think it's an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So hope that helped."

So we feel really good about the growth we've been getting, and we will be doing a number of things to try to accelerate it further. When you say though talk about your international strategy, that's always a challenging question. Because we don't have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the U.K. We have different strategy in Germany where we're greatly able to leverage the tremendous strength of our [indiscernible] business, which has really nice synergies, the card business. We have a totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside of the U.S. and the tremendous market position that's growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where, due to a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double digits for a number of years right now. I could go on but, I guess, my point is we feel good about the trends that we've seen for a couple of years now. We are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where, frankly, we see the greatest traction, and I just named a couple of them. It might be go on, but I won't -- don't want to take too much of everyone's time.

Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working relationships and operating relationships where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our goal is not to necessarily as the first priority find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes. That's not really the goal. Our goal is not to lose money to it. So from time to time, we have one of those companies that has some -- take some kind of exit and there are modest gains that I usually don't even bother to talk about are modest losses. For now that's too quite a nice modest positive. But as I said, that's not the goal.

So to remind everyone, what I'm trying to do the last 3 quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put that cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our Membership Rewards and co-brand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So we try to add all those up as they've been growing some at similarly in recent quarters, they were actually been growing a little bit slower than billings, that will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year's fourth quarter a couple of true-ups that kind of onetime thank you have from time to time that helped lower last year's Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to let at the sequential run rates of rewards to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that cashback counter rewards sequentially aren't going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the 2 things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant costs. How much? We'll have to see what this take up is, et cetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that's a little helpful in how you think about it."

Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff."

These results reflect our continued focus on our priori",3657,"Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which is 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter, and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.
The favorability was driven by faster-than-anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we've discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter and the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally, we continue to use our capital strengths to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. 
Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals' decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. I'd like to point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.
The progress we've made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively in Q4, with a number of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. This includes a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. 
In addition, we're going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new card members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.
With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter.
In support of this, we're planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead.
I highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term.
Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. The revenues decreased by 5%, reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I'd note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter, the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses. 
We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count.
This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include the restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost-reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last 2 quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.
We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remained healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remained strong, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter.
We're also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products.
Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which impacted our year-over-year growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter.
And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost-reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.
Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX-adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an uptick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within [indiscernible]. 
Within the EMEA region, our U.K. business continues to perform very well with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 '15, reflecting the sales of the 2 cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold cobrand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX.
On this basis, adjusted worldwide loans growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects. 
Over the last 2 years, as our cobrand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-cobrand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, but they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mixed change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile, and it is producing good returns.
Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influenced this change. The sold cobrand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-cobrand card member launch to which our mix has shifted have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year.
Turning to provision on Slide 8. Total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 '15 related to the 2 cobrand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6%, however, is a combination of 2 different trends. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low.
Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages.
Turning to our reported lending credit metrics. I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among large peer issuers.
Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I'd emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook, and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9. Reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March.
As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes.
Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico.
Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee-paying customers even in the phase of an intense competitive environment.
Moving on. Net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12%, and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year.
Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we've seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the cobrand portfolios.
Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11. We saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchants' negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue.
We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business moved down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS, or network business in Q3, as cobrand volumes declined.
Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12. You can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards.
Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from cobrand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue.
Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco cobrand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter.
Looking forward, however, and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.
Turning then to operating expenses. We continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.
Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. I'd remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter's earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses will be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. 
As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas, and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters.
Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we've had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. We are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year.
Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed. 
Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increase brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants.
We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond.
As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially, and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 levels.
Moving now to capital. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
So let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost-reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history, we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results.
On last quarter's earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.
Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity, combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance, offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed, would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Turning to 2017. Our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster-than-expected progress on our cost-reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see at the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost-reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.
We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer-term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place."

We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can't. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer-term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we're after. Now what is the rising interest rate environment as mean for that? Well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us, all else being equal, rising interest rates are -- cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions, and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will drive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment we face with rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we'll have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment."

What I would say is that we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high-end cards, and that's the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and in the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion Lounges to expansion of various travel-oriented credits around TSA Precheck and Global Entry, through status that we're able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things, and there's a lot of thought, a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more. So none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They're all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match."

When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year, and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I'd start there and say, we feel pretty good about that franchise, and it's part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about a particularly good growth we've seen in the U.S. consumer space with our Cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we'll have to -- it's far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there's -- I said a few minutes ago, we're in the game for the very long term to go long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways, is built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second, we've had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value, financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what's happening with overall market share. But I would say our #1 goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we're not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we've lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years.

On 2017, expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into 3 categories: Operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario, and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I'm telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we've made in identifying and executing in a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we'll have to see but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that, and we're continuing to work every day to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We'll have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent that we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario, both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I'm certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn't continue every day to be a very, very competitive environment. So our M&P probably come somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much. Rewards is certainly a moving target because it's a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our Cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I'll tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we've seen the last few quarters where in total rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings, that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you that we've been planning that for some time. That's why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards costs overall faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I'm probably going to wait 1 more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that, and the Q4 results, I think, will help everyone begin to calibrate as well."

And then I would also point out, as I said earlier, that, that is typical of the majority of countries outside the U.S. where we, in most countries, not all, but in most do find ourselves are gaining share, albeit starting from much smaller basis in share than what we have in the U.S. We have a very flexible business model. You hear us talk a lot about many different advantages that having a closed-loop model gives us, and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact every day we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And every day, we've got to demonstrate our value to card members. That is giving us some flexibility in the U.K. and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and card members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves. So we are pleased with the growth in the U.K. I would say it -- that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So we're pleased with that, and we're working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone, however, that they're in the nearer term an offset, which we talked about when we talked about the discount rates, is that we are in a multiyear process, probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar, but bring the absolute rate down, and that's part of what we've been talking about for some time now. That's part of what's putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So that is an offset that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we're seeing in Europe."

There's probably a couple of different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So yes, every quarter, we get better, more sophisticated, more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed loop data in terms of making our digital marketing more effective. And that's why across the globe in our consumer businesses, the majority of our new card member acquisitions for some time now have come through digital channels. So one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend over time without losing traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter, we get a little better in digital marketing. It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you're in, in the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers, and that was a very low-cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to 2 good brands. So we have lost that. One of the things internally that we did -- do look at that and are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we've effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that, and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now, even though we've lost that one big former channel, we're above what they were in the prior year, and we feel good about that mix. I would say, though, that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year, and that's going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question."

I'd remind, Moshe, you and for everyone, as we resegmented the company after 10 reorganized the company late last year, we created the 4 new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anre Williams represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the -- what we call the GNS, or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity cobrand. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most card part because most of those relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it's really going to attract the overall company because what you're really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer in commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we're calling ICNS, or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I'd say is the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics, and I'm not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GNS, or network business, we continue to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I'd say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity, and that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question."

Okay, I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those cobrand card members with non-cobrand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-cobrand card members are more likely to revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the cobrand card members. We priced for that. That's part of why as I went to the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you're losing the lower-yielding cobrand card members and you're gaining more non-cobrand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that's the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning because you go through a process over the first year or 2 that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the 2 things going on that had led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we've been growing them for a very long time, and we think we can do without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I'd also just remind you, the other reason that we've been able to do that for some years now because remember, it's not -- we didn't just accelerate our loan growth. It's been well above the industry for several years now, and you haven't seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we're just focused on it now, and we're creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We're creating marketing that actually drives people to the product. Frankly, we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target-rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that's a key difference, I think, Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we sought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn't have to figure out, well, boy, we're already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members? We had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say, well, what do we do to start trimming our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunities set than others may have, and I think it's an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So I hope that helped."

But we'll have to see. There's -- we feel very comfortable and confident in the choices we've made, but there's a lot of factors, whether it's the economy or interest rates that someone brought up earlier or the evolving competitive environment. What I'd say is we feel good about the earnings guidance we've given people for 2016 and 2017. We feel good about the revenue trends we've seen year-to-date. We feel good about the decisions we've made, and we'll see how that all plays out in 2017."

I think you should presume that we will execute upon the CCAR approvals that we have from a share repurchase perspective. And so that math will get you to some continued significant uplift in EPS versus net income. When you think about the quarter we were just in, I would say a couple of things. You would expect to see, based on all the comments we've made, a little growth in rewards costs relative to the quarter we just saw. On the other hand, we have a lot of operating expense that we are now confident we will get out as we get into 2017. We also believe we can moderate the marketing and promotional line somewhat. I talked a little bit earlier about the tooling and throwing that we'll debate internally over the next couple of months about just how much. And then clearly, we are very focused on continuing to get good revenue growth and our goal is to accelerate it. So you can sort of back into what that will mean depending on what you want to believe about where we'd end up on an EPS perspective in some way. And I supposed the probably least valuable of all the variables I just talked you through would be share repurchase because you can publicly see what we're going to do. Thanks to the said CCAR process. So that's probably the way I would think about it, Eric."

So it's a good question, Rick. So to remind everyone, what I've been trying to do the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put our Cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our Membership Rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So we try to add all those up as they've been growing so much similarly in recent quarters, rewards of that have been growing a little slower than billings, that will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year's fourth quarter a couple of true-ups, the kind of onetime things you have from time to time that helped lower last year's Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run rates of rewards to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that Cashback contra rewards sequentially aren't going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the 2 things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant cost. How much? We'll have to see what the takeup is, et cetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that's a little helpful in how you think about it."

As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which was 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our prior",3659,"Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which was 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter, and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.
The favorability was driven by faster-than-anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we've discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter and the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally  we continue to use our capital strengths to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. 
Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals' decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit, though I'd point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.
The progress we've made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively in Q4, with a number of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. This includes a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. 
In addition, we're going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new card members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.
With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter.
In support of this, we're planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead.
I highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term.
Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. The revenues decreased by 5%, reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I'd note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter; the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses. 
We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count.
This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include the restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost-reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last 2 quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.
We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remains healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remains strong, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter.
We're also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products.
Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which impacted our year-over-year growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter.
And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost-reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.
Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX-adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an uptick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today. 
Within the EMEA region, our U.K. business continues to perform very well with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 '15, reflecting the sales of the 2 cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold cobrand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX.
On this basis, adjusted worldwide loan growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects. 
Over the last 2 years, as our cobrand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-cobrand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, though they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mixed change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile, and it is producing good returns.
Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influence this change. The sold cobrand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-cobrand card member loans, to which our mix has shifted have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year.
Turning to provision on Slide 8. Total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 '15 related to the 2 cobrand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6%, however, is a combination of 2 different trends. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low.
Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate in loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages.
Turning to our reported lending credit metrics. I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among large peer issuers.
Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I'd emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook, and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9. Reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March.
As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes.
Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico.
Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee-paying customers even in the face of an intense competitive environment.
Moving on. Net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12%, and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year.
Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we've seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the cobrand portfolios.
Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11. We saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchant negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue.
We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business move down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS, or our network business in Q3, as cobrand volumes declined.
Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12. You can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards.
Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from cobrand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue.
Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco cobrand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter.
Looking forward, however, and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.
Turning then to operating expenses. We continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.
Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. I'd remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter's earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses would be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. 
As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas, and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters.
Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we've had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. We are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year.
Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we've had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed. 
Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increase brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants.
We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond.
As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially, and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 levels.
Moving now to capital. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
So let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost-reduction efforts and continue to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history, we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results.
On last quarter's earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.
Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity, combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance, offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed, would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Turning to 2017. Our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster-than-expected progress on our cost-reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost-reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.
We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer-term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place."

We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can't. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer-term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we're after. Now what does a rising interest rate environment mean for that? Well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us, all else being equal, rising interest rates are -- cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions, and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will thrive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment we face, including rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we'll have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment."

What I would say is that we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high-end cards, and that's the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and in the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, you every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion Lounges to expansion of various travel-oriented credits around TSA Precheck and Global Entry, through status that we're able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things, and there's a lot of thought, a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more. So none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They're all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match."

When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year, and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I'd start there and say, we feel pretty good about that franchise, and it's part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about the particularly good growth we've seen in the U.S. consumer space with our Cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we'll have to -- it's far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there's -- I said a few minutes ago, we're in the game for the very long term; to build long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways, is built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis, and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second, we've had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value; financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what's happening with overall market share. But I would say our #1 goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we're not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we've lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S., we've been gaining share in almost every market in which we operate. But I would close by saying our #1 objective, though, is making the right decisions to build sustainable financial value."

On 2017, expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into 3 categories: Operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario, and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I'm telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we've made in identifying and executing in a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we'll have to see but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that, and we're continuing to work every day to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We'll have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario, both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I'm certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn't continue every day to be a very, very competitive environment. So our M&P probably come somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much. Rewards is certainly a moving target because it's a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our Cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I'll tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we've seen the last few quarters where in total rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings, that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you that we've been planning that for some time. That's why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards costs will grow faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I'm probably going to wait one more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that, and the Q4 results, I think, will help everyone begin to calibrate as well."

And then I would also point out, as I said earlier, that, that is typical of the majority of countries outside the U.S. where we, in most countries, not all, but in most do find ourselves are gaining share, albeit starting from much smaller basis in share than what we have in the U.S. We have a very flexible business model. You hear us talk a lot about the many different advantages that having a closed-loop model gives us, and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact every day we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And every day, we've got to demonstrate our value to card members. That is giving us some flexibility in the U.K. and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and card members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves. So we are pleased with the growth in the U.K. I would say it -- that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So we're pleased with that, and we're working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone, however, that they're in the nearer term -- an offset, which we talk about when we talk about the discount rates, is that we are in a multiyear process, probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar, but bring the absolute rate down, and that's part of what we've been talking about for some time now. That's part of what's putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So that is an offset that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we're seeing in Europe."

There's probably a couple of different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So yes, every quarter, we get better, more sophisticated, more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed loop data in terms of making our digital marketing more effective. And that's why across the globe in our consumer businesses, the majority of our new card member acquisitions for some time now have come through digital channels. So one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend over time without losing traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter, we get a little better in digital marketing. It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you're in, in the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers, and that was a very low-cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to 2 good brands. So we have lost that. One of the things internally that we do look at and are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we've effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that, and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now, even though we've lost that one big former channel, we're above what they were in the prior year, and we feel good about that mix. I would say, though, that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year, and that's going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question."

I'd remind, Moshe, you and everyone, as we resegmented the company after Ken reorganized the company late last year, we created the 4 new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anre Williams represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the -- what we call the GNS, or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity cobrand. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most part because most of those relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it's really going to track the overall company because what you're really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer and commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we're calling ICNS, or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I'd say is the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics, and I'm not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GNS, or network business, we continue to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I'd say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity, and that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question."

As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly",550,"Good question. Okay, I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those cobrand card members with non-cobrand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-cobrand card members are more likely to revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the cobrand card members. We priced for that. That's part of why as I went through the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you're losing the lower-yielding cobrand card members and you're gaining more non-cobrand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that's the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning, because you go through a process over the first year or 2 that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the 2 things going on that had led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we've been growing them for a very long time, and we think we can do it without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I'd also just remind you, the other reason that we've been able to do that for some years now because remember, it's not -- we didn't just accelerate our loan growth. It's been well above the industry for several years now, and you haven't seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we're just focused on it now, and we're creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We're creating marketing that actually drives people to the product. Frankly, we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target-rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that's a key difference, I think, Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we sought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn't have to figure out, well, boy, we're already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members? We had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say, well, what do we do to start trimming our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunities set than others may have, and I think it's an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning.

And I do think we are trying to drive even more growth out of our international businesses. I would point out for some time now with the one challenge we had, and Canada aside, we have seen really nice growth across our international consumer businesses. Our international small business segment, which is reported in GCS, is -- has consistently for some time now been our highest growth segment in the company. So we feel really good about the growth we've been getting, and we will be doing a number of things to try to accelerate it further. When you say, though, talk about your international strategy, that's always a challenging question. Because we don't have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the U.K. We have different strategy in Germany where we're greatly able to leverage the tremendous strength of our [indiscernible] business, which has really nice synergies. With the card business, we have a totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside of the U.S. and a tremendous market position that's growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where, due to a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double digits for a number of years right now. I could go on but, I guess, my point is we feel good about the trends that we've seen for a couple of years now. We are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where, frankly, we see the greatest traction, and I just named a couple of them. I might be going on, but I won't take too much time -- of everyone's time. And it's really more about just putting more time, effort, resource and focus behind the things we're already doing."

Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working relationships and operating relationships where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our goal is not to necessarily as the first priority find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes. That's not really the goal. Now our goal is not to lose money doing it. So from time to time, we have one of those companies that has some -- take some kind of exit and there are modest gains that I don't usually even bother to talk about or modest losses.

So to remind everyone, what I've been trying to do the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put our Cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our Membership Rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So we try to add all those up as they've been growing somewhat similarly in recent quarters, rewards have actually been growing a little slower than billings, that will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year's fourth quarter a couple of true-ups; the kind of onetime things you have from time to time that helped lower last year's Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run rates of rewards, Rick, to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that Cashback contra rewards sequentially aren't going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the 2 things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant cost out. How much? We'll have to see what the takeup is, et cetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that's a little helpful in how you think about it."

As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which was 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our prior",3659,"Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which was 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter, and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.
The favorability was driven by faster-than-anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we've discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter and the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally  we continue to use our capital strengths to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. 
Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals' decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit, though I'd point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.
The progress we've made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively in Q4, with a number of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. This includes a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. 
In addition, we're going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new card members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.
With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter.
In support of this, we're planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead.
I highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term.
Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2. The revenues decreased by 5%, reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I'd note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter; the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year, due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses. 
We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count.
This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include the restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost-reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last 2 quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.
We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remains healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remains strong, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter.
We're also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products.
Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which impacted our year-over-year growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter.
And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost-reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.
Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX-adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an uptick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today. 
Within the EMEA region, our U.K. business continues to perform very well with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.
Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 '15, reflecting the sales of the 2 cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold cobrand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX.
On this basis, adjusted worldwide loan growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality prospects. 
Over the last 2 years, as our cobrand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-cobrand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, though they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mixed change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile, and it is producing good returns.
Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influence this change. The sold cobrand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-cobrand card member loans, to which our mix has shifted have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year.
Turning to provision on Slide 8. Total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 '15 related to the 2 cobrand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6%, however, is a combination of 2 different trends. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low.
Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate in loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages.
Turning to our reported lending credit metrics. I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among large peer issuers.
Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I'd emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook, and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward.
Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9. Reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March.
As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes.
Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico.
Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee-paying customers even in the face of an intense competitive environment.
Moving on. Net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12%, and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year.
Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we've seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the cobrand portfolios.
Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11. We saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchant negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue.
We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business move down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS, or our network business in Q3, as cobrand volumes declined.
Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12. You can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards.
Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from cobrand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue.
Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco cobrand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter.
Looking forward, however, and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.
Turning then to operating expenses. We continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.
Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. I'd remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter's earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses would be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. 
As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas, and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters.
Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we've had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. We are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year.
Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we've had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed. 
Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increase brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants.
We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond.
As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially, and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 levels.
Moving now to capital. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
So let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year.
During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost-reduction efforts and continue to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history, we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results.
On last quarter's earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.
Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity, combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance, offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed, would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Turning to 2017. Our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster-than-expected progress on our cost-reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost-reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.
We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer-term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place."

We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can't. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer-term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we're after. Now what does a rising interest rate environment mean for that? Well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us, all else being equal, rising interest rates are -- cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions, and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will thrive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment we face, including rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we'll have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment."

What I would say is that we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high-end cards, and that's the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and in the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, you every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion Lounges to expansion of various travel-oriented credits around TSA Precheck and Global Entry, through status that we're able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things, and there's a lot of thought, a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more. So none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They're all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match."

When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year, and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I'd start there and say, we feel pretty good about that franchise, and it's part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about the particularly good growth we've seen in the U.S. consumer space with our Cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we'll have to -- it's far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there's -- I said a few minutes ago, we're in the game for the very long term; to build long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways, is built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis, and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second, we've had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value; financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what's happening with overall market share. But I would say our #1 goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we're not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we've lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S., we've been gaining share in almost every market in which we operate. But I would close by saying our #1 objective, though, is making the right decisions to build sustainable financial value."

On 2017, expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into 3 categories: Operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario, and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I'm telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we've made in identifying and executing in a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we'll have to see but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that, and we're continuing to work every day to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We'll have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario, both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I'm certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn't continue every day to be a very, very competitive environment. So our M&P probably come somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much. Rewards is certainly a moving target because it's a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our Cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I'll tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we've seen the last few quarters where in total rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings, that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you that we've been planning that for some time. That's why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards costs will grow faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I'm probably going to wait one more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that, and the Q4 results, I think, will help everyone begin to calibrate as well."

You hear us talk a lot about the many different advantages that having a closed-loop model gives us, and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact every day we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And every day, we've got to demonstrate our value to card members. That is giving us some flexibility in the U.K. and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and card members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves. So we are pleased with the growth in the U.K. I would say it -- that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So we're pleased with that, and we're working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone, however, that they're in the nearer term -- an offset, which we talk about when we talk about the discount rates, is that we are in a multiyear process, probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar, but bring the absolute rate down, and that's part of what we've been talking about for some time now. That's part of what's putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So that is an offset that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we're seeing in Europe."

Or are you -- you're just getting better at acquiring customers than maybe you were a couple of years ago?"

There's probably a couple of different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So yes, every quarter, we get better, more sophisticated, more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed loop data in terms of making our digital marketing more effective. And that's why across the globe in our consumer businesses, the majority of our new card member acquisitions for some time now have come through digital channels. So one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend over time without losing traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter, we get a little better in digital marketing. It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you're in, in the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers, and that was a very low-cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to 2 good brands. So we have lost that. One of the things internally that we do look at and are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we've effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that, and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now, even though we've lost that one big former channel, we're above what they were in the prior year, and we feel good about that mix. I would say, though, that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year, and that's going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question."

I'd remind, Moshe, you and everyone, as we resegmented the company after Ken reorganized the company late last year, we created the 4 new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anre Williams represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the -- what we call the GNS, or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity cobrand. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most part because most of those relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it's really going to track the overall company because what you're really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer and commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we're calling ICNS, or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I'd say is the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics, and I'm not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GNS, or network business, we continue to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I'd say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity, and that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question."

As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly",550,"Good question. Okay, I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those cobrand card members with non-cobrand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-cobrand card members are more likely to revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the cobrand card members. We priced for that. That's part of why as I went through the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you're losing the lower-yielding cobrand card members and you're gaining more non-cobrand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that's the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning, because you go through a process over the first year or 2 that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the 2 things going on that had led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we've been growing them for a very long time, and we think we can do it without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I'd also just remind you, the other reason that we've been able to do that for some years now because remember, it's not -- we didn't just accelerate our loan growth. It's been well above the industry for several years now, and you haven't seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we're just focused on it now, and we're creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We're creating marketing that actually drives people to the product. Frankly, we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target-rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that's a key difference, I think, Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we sought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn't have to figure out, well, boy, we're already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members? We had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say, well, what do we do to start trimming our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunities set than others may have, and I think it's an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So I hope that helped."

And I do think we are trying to drive even more growth out of our international businesses.

Our international small business segment, which is reported in GCS, is -- has consistently for some time now been our highest growth segment in the company. So we feel really good about the growth we've been getting, and we will be doing a number of things to try to accelerate it further. When you say, though, talk about your international strategy, that's always a challenging question. Because we don't have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the U.K. We have different strategy in Germany where we're greatly able to leverage the tremendous strength of our [indiscernible] business, which has really nice synergies. With the card business, we have a totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside of the U.S. and a tremendous market position that's growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where, due to a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double digits for a number of years right now. I could go on but, I guess, my point is we feel good about the trends that we've seen for a couple of years now. We are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where, frankly, we see the greatest traction, and I just named a couple of them. I might be going on, but I won't take too much time -- of everyone's time. And it's really more about just putting more time, effort, resource and focus behind the things we're already doing."

Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working relationships and operating relationships where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our goal is not to necessarily as the first priority find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes. That's not really the goal. Now our goal is not to lose money doing it. So from time to time, we have one of those companies that has some -- take some kind of exit and there are modest gains that I don't usually even bother to talk about or modest losses. For now, it's sort of too -- quite a nice modest positive. But as I said, that's not the goal.

So it's a good question, Rick. So to remind everyone, what I've been trying to do the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put our Cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our Membership Rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So we try to add all those up as they've been growing somewhat similarly in recent quarters, rewards have actually been growing a little slower than billings, that will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year's fourth quarter a couple of true-ups; the kind of onetime things you have from time to time that helped lower last year's Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run rates of rewards, Rick, to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that Cashback contra rewards sequentially aren't going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the 2 things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant cost out. How much? We'll have to see what the takeup is, et cetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that's a little helpful in how you think about it."
