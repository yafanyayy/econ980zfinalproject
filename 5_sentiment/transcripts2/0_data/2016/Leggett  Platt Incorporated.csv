As we reported yesterday, we are extremely pleased with our 2015 results and expect continued strong performance in 2016. For the full year 2015, we achieved record sales from c",1187,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. 
As we reported yesterday, we are extremely pleased with our 2015 results and expect continued strong performance in 2016. 
For the full year 2015, we achieved record sales from continuing operations, record EBIT and record earnings per share. Sales grew 4% for the year to $3.92 billion; higher unit volume of 6% and acquisitions, 3%, added 9% to sales growth. These improvements were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Full year sales benefited from ongoing contact gains and new program awards in automotive. The continued shift in bedding, the Comfort Core Springs and strong growth in our adjustable beds. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, up 31% from $1.78 in the prior year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT grew 31% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 270 basis points to 12.9%. In the fourth quarter, sales from continuing operations were $945 million, down 1% from the prior year; higher unit volume, 3%; and acquisitions added 1%, added 4% but were more than offset by raw material price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. 
Earnings performance was stronger-than-expected during the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.64 compared to $0.41 in the same quarter last year, for an increase of 56%. Adjusted earnings grew primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volume and lower stock compensation expense. Additional decreases in steel cost late in the year led to a larger-than-expected LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. While the LIFO impact is typically offset within the segments as the higher cost inventory flows through earnings, that offset did not fully occur in the fourth quarter. Because of the year-end timing of the cost decreases that triggered the additional benefit, part of the offset and segment level impact will occur in early 2016. 
Fourth quarter EBIT -- adjusted EBIT increased 44% and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 13.8%, up 440 basis points over fourth quarter last year. 
Late in the year, we completed the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business, the final Store Fixtures operations, which had been reported in discontinued operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
Portfolio management will remain a strategic priority as we move forward. Over the past few years, we have enhanced our portfolio and improved our margins by growing our stronger-performing businesses and by exiting businesses that struggle to consistently deliver acceptable margins and returns.
Now onto the segment details. 
For the full year, margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volume grew in nearly all of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact offset some of this full year sales growth. 
For the fourth quarter, margins improved in 3 of the 4 segments, with Commercial Products segment margins flat with last year. Volume growth continued in many of our businesses but the offsetting impact from commodity deflation and currency also continued throughout the quarter. 
In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 3%, with unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impacts. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring Component dollar sales increased 4%; innerspring unit volume grew 3%, with Comfort Core up 55% during the quarter; bought spring unit volume increased 7%. International Spring sales grew 10%; furniture component sales were down slightly, with sales in the and the sofa sleepers business up 4% and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. Volume also grew in Geo Components and decreased in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter from significantly lower litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT and EBIT margin improved primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volumes and lower stock compensation expense.
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 5%. Higher unit volume and acquisitions increased sales by 10% but were partially offset by the commodity deflation and currency impact. U.S. innerspring units grew 8%, with Comfort Core units up 51% for the full year. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new Comfort Core products and our customers growing use of these components in their product lines. 
Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 11% and EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.2%, primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. 
In the Commercial Products segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 10%, primarily from an acquisition completed early in the year. Same location sales were down slightly, with unit volume growth and Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed more than offset by lower volume in Work Furniture and currency impact. Our acquisition in the segment was a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operations and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. The segment's EBIT increased slightly during the quarter, and EBIT margin was flat with the prior year. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 21% with same location sales up 12%. Strong performance on our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove the majority of the same location sales growth. Adjustable Bed units grew 51% for the full year. The segment's EBIT increased 37% and EBIT margin improved 80 basis points to 6.8%, primarily from higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter sales were down 16%. From steel-related price decreases and lower Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter with cost improvements partially offset by a $3 million loss on the divestiture of the Steel Tubing business. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 5% with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price reductions and lower freight sales from our rod mill. The segment's EBIT for the year increased 17%, and EBIT margin improved 120 basis points to 6.5% 
as cost improvements more than offset an impairment charge of $6 million in divestiture loss of $3 million related to the Steel Tubing business. 
In the Specialized Products segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 7% with a 12% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 14%, machinery sales grew 15% and commercial vehicle product sales were up 11%. Aerospace sales were down slightly in the quarter. The segment's EBIT increased, and EBIT margin improved 250 basis points, primarily from higher volume.
Full year total sales in the segment grew 4%, with a 9% volume increase partially offset by currency impact. Strong performance on our Automotive and Machinery businesses drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding the currency changes, automotive sales grew 13% for the full year. The segments EBIT increased 24% and EBIT margin improved 260 basis points to 16.3%, primarily from higher sales. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."
30760,315549221,924440,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, we generated operating cash flow of $359 million, after paying $82 million to settle phone litigation.

In 2015, we generated operating cash flow of $359 million, after paying $82 million to settle phone litigation. Full year cash flow came in slightly below our prior forecast due to the timing of the litigation payments, with a major part of those occurring just before year-end. The substantial majority of these cases have now been settled and paid. We entered the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales of 9.5%. 
In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $41.58, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $44.36 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
For the full year, we repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $45.72 and issued 2.2 million shares. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the year with net debt to net capital at 34.5%, comfortably within our loan target range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At year-end, our debt was 1.5x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that just ended on December 31, 2015, we met our goal of producing top-tier TSR. We generated compound annull TSR of 20% per year over this past 3 years, significantly better than the S&P 500's 50% annual TSR for the same time per year. 
Before we discuss our 2016 guidance detail, it maybe helpful to remind everyone of the major macro drivers for our business. Consumer confidence is the primary indicator that we monitor since they most significantly influences demand for bedding and furniture. Total housing turnover also affects demand in these businesses but to a lesser degree than consumer confidence. Broadly favorable trends in these 2 indicators should result in positive marketing conditions for at least half of our revenue base. Across our diversified businesses, we have no direct exposure to the oil industry. However, lower energy prices have historically been positive for demand in our residential markets, with consumer having more discretionary income available to spend on larger ticket purchases. Lower fuel prices also typically support SUV and large vehicle demand, which is beneficial to our Automotive business. 
Geographically, our largest exposure by far is the U.S., followed by Northern Europe. We produce in China but a majority of that product is exported in either component form or in our customers' finished products for consumption in North America or Europe. Chinese consumption patterns impact only about 3% of Leggett's total sales. Our automotive business is the only part of our portfolio that is meaningfully exposed to domestic Chinese demand, with about 20% of its revenue base remaining in that market.
While Chinese auto production slowed in 2015, the market still grew 3% or roughly in line with growth in both North America and Europe. As Karl mentioned earlier, our automotive business grew its unit volume by 13% in 2015. 
Current automotive industry forecast anticipate production in the major markets to grow by approximately 4% in 2016. We expect to continue outperforming global auto production by at least 10 percentage points for the foreseeable future based upon content gains and new programs that we've been awarded. 
With this collective backdrop for 2016, we once again expect sales growth, which should lead to another year of strong margins and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion or flat to 5% higher than in 2015. 
Inner volume growth should be in a middle to high single digits with continued strong demand in many of our product categories, an improvement expected in the majority of our end markets. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% to 3% reduction from commodity deflation and a 2% decrease from the Steel Tubing divestiture completed in late December. 
We expect 2016 earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.50. Ranging from 2015's strong earnings performance, this guidance assumes that unit volume growth will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins but that benefit is expected to be largely offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. Based upon this guidance, we currently expect full year EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13%, roughly in line with our 2015 performance. Our guidance assumes that commodity prices, primarily steel, stabilize near current levels. We expect to generate operating cash of approximately $450 million in 2016. Dividend should require about $175 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. 
Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of earnings. Actual payout has been higher in recent years and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. With our strong earnings growth in 2015, we are now comfortably within our targeted payout range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with our EPS growth. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must make stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established, however, we currently expect the repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

The way I would encourage you to think about it is that in the fourth quarter, we recognized $15 million more in LIFO benefit than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. That was caused by the steel deflation that took place in November and December. Because of the timing of that deflation had a very late in the year, in fact, in the back half of the quarter, a meaningful part of that $15 million increase in LIFO was not offset during the quarter. And in fact, will carry over into the early part of 2016 with a lot of that being in the first quarter. As you know, commodity moves impact LIFO pretty quickly, and it takes a little bit more time to work through the segments. We have to have usually a quarter, maybe a little bit more than that for the entire cost materials to roll through, and for us to get to a point where we can actually revalue our inventories. And neither of these things really happened in the fourth quarter. And so a part of it would've been offset but not all of it. And that will, like I said, will carryover into the first quarter."

We're looking at mid- to high single digits unit volume growth. We do expect deflation to offset part of that. And we now also have the impact from the divestiture. When you look at our current full year guidance flat to 5% and compare that to the framework we put out there in October, what changed is basically the divestiture impact and maybe a little bit more deflation. Otherwise, we're basically in line with what we thought at the end of October. So taking that through the quarters, I would encourage you first to decide where you want to be in that full year flat to 5% range. And then in the first quarter, subtract 300 basis points from that full year growth rate. In the second quarter, subtract 100 basis points. And in the third and fourth quarters, add 200 basis points each. So at the midpoint of the guidance range, which would be about 2% to 3% growth in the first quarter, we'd be looking at sales that were flat to down 1%. In the second quarter, we'd be looking at sales that would be up 1% to 2%. And each of the third and fourth quarters, we should be in the 4% to 5% up range. You didn't specifically ask about margins, but I'll go ahead and throw that in here to, too. Qualitatively, in the first half of 2016, we should be ahead of '15's EBIT margin in both the first and second quarters. Third and fourth quarters in '15, obviously, we had very strong margin performance in both of those quarters. We will likely be below those margin levels in the back half of the year with a full year margins essentially flat, which is what we already said. And I'll just reiterate that LIFO overhang, if you will, with the FIFO impact in the segments will most significantly impact our first quarter with the bulk of that being in our residential segment with a little bit more in industrial."

We are going to discontinue that because we think that it just isn't sensible for anyone to make investment decisions on what happens from a month-to-month basis. So we're happy to give you color as Perry just did with the fourth quarter, but we just don't think it's prudent to do that in the future."

And then to conclude divestitures to get us completely out of the Store Fixtures business, which will declare victory on that one, to sell CVP and then on Christmas Eve, to get the Steel Tubing divestiture done. All the while they were looking at a number of acquisitions doing very deep dives. And now in 2016, continuing to look at some additional divestiture work and look at acquisitions. But I will say, and we will be acquisitive. As a matter of fact I have every expectation aerospace acquisition later this month but it's small. Our stated growth target, current stated growth target is 4% to 5% or really 2x expectation of GDP growth. When we look at our strategic planned forecast for the next 3 years, so '16, '17, '18. We're looking today at a greater than 7% CAGR. So 3x our expectation of GDP. So we feel really good about where we're positioned from an organic perspective. So that allows us to be very systemic in our analysis of acquisition. So you're right. We'll throw off a lot of cash. How we apply that cash will grow through the normal usage. We'll continue to invest in organic growth. You see CapEx forecast for the first time a little bit above depreciation and amortization. That's an investment that we see in automotive and continued growth in U.S. and European Comfort Core capability. We don't talk about Europe much. European spring off a fantastic quarter and is year has sold out. So long-winded answer, but we will continue to be acquisitive, but we have the luxury of continuing to be disciplined."

As we reported yesterday, we are extremely pleased with our 2015 results and expect continued strong performance in 2016. 
For the full year 2015, we achieved record sales from continuing operations, record EBIT and record earnings per share. Sales grew 4% for the year to $3.92 billion. Higher unit volume of 6% and acquisitions 3%, added 9% to sales growth. These improvements were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Full year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive. The continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs and strong growth in our adjustable beds. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, up 31% from $1.78 in the prior year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT grew 31% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 270 basis points to 12.9%. In the fourth quarter, sales from continuing operations were $945 million, down 1% from the prior year. Higher unit volume 3% and acquisitions 1%, added 4%, but were more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. 
Earnings performance was stronger than expected during the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.64 compared to $0.41 in the same quarter last year, for an increase of 56%. Adjusted earnings grew primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volume and lower stock compensation expense. Additional decreases in steel cost late in the year led to a larger than expected LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. While the LIFO impact is typically offset within the segments, as the higher cost inventory flows through earnings, that offset did not fully occur in the fourth quarter. Because of the year-end timing of the cost decreases that triggered the additional benefit, part of the offset in segment-level impact will occur in early 2016. 
Fourth quarter EBIT -- adjusted EBIT increased 44% and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 13.8%, up 440 basis points over fourth quarter last year. 
Late in the year, we completed the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business, the final Store Fixtures operation, which had been reported in discontinued operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
Portfolio management will remain a strategic priority as we move forward. Over the past few years, we have enhanced our portfolio and improved our margins by growing our stronger-performing businesses and by exiting businesses that struggle to consistently deliver acceptable margins and returns.
Now onto the segment details. For the full year, margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volume grew in nearly all of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact offset some of this full year sales growth. 
For the fourth quarter, margins improved in 3 of the 4 segments, with Commercial Products segment margins flat with last year. Volume growth continued in many of our businesses, but the offsetting impact from commodity deflation and currency also continued throughout the quarter. 
In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 3%, with unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impacts. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 4%; innerspring unit volume grew 3%, with Comfort Core up 55% during the quarter; boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 10%; furniture component sales were down slightly, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 4%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. Volume also grew in Geo Components and decreased in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter from significantly lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT and EBIT margin improved primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volumes and lower stock compensation expense.
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 5%. Higher unit volume and acquisitions increased sales by 10%, but were partially offset by the commodity deflation and currency impact. U.S. innerspring units grew 8%, with Comfort Core units up 51% for the full year. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new Comfort Core products and our customers growing use of these components in their product lines. 
Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 11% and EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.2%, primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. 
In the Commercial Products segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 10%, primarily from an acquisition completed early in the year. Same location sales were down slightly, with unit volume growth and Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed more than offset by lower volume in Work Furniture and currency impact. Our acquisition in the segment was a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. The segment's EBIT increased slightly during the quarter, and EBIT margin was flat with the prior year. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 21%, with same location sales up 12%. Strong performance on our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove the majority of the same location sales growth. Adjustable Bed units grew 51% for the full year. The segment's EBIT increased 37% and EBIT margin improved 80 basis points to 6.8%, primarily from higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter sales were down 16% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter with cost improvements partially offset by a $3 million loss on the divestiture of a Steel Tubing business. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 5% with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price reductions and lower trade sales from our rod mill. The segment's EBIT for the year increased 17%, and EBIT margin improved 120 basis points to 6.5%, as cost improvements more than offset an impairment charge of $6 million and divestiture loss of $3 million related to the Steel Tubing business. 
In the Specialized Products segment, fourth quarter sales increased 7% with a 12% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 14%, Machinery sales grew 15% and Commercial Vehicle Product sales were up 11%. Aerospace sales were down slightly in the quarter. The segment's EBIT increased, and EBIT margin improved 250 basis points, primarily from higher volume.
Full year total sales in the segment grew 4%, with a 9% volume increase partially offset by currency impact. Strong performance on our Automotive and Machinery businesses drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding the currency changes, automotive sales grew 13% for the full year. The segments EBIT increased 24% and EBIT margin improved 260 basis points to 16.3%, primarily from higher sales. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."

In 2015, we generated operating cash flow of $359 million, after paying $82 million to settle foam litigation. Full year cash flow came in slightly below our prior forecast due to the timing of the litigation payments, with a major part of those occurring just before year-end. The substantial majority of these cases have now been settled and paid. We entered the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales of 9.5%. 
In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $41.58, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $44.36 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
For the full year, we repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $45.72 and issued 2.2 million shares. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the year with net debt to net capital at 34.5%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At year-end, our debt was 1.5x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that just ended on December 31, 2015, we met our goal of producing top 1/3 TSR. We generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year over these past 3 years, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15% annual TSR for the same time per year. 
Before we discuss our 2016 guidance details, it maybe helpful to remind everyone of the major macro drivers for our business. Consumer confidence is the primary indicator that we monitor since it most significantly influences demand for bedding and furniture. Total housing turnover also affects demand in these businesses, but to a lesser degree than consumer confidence. Broadly favorable trends in these 2 indicators should result in positive marketing conditions for at least half of our revenue base. Across our diversified businesses, we have no direct exposure to the oil industry. However, lower energy prices have historically been positive for demand in our residential markets, with consumers having more discretionary income available to spend on larger ticket purchases. Lower fuel prices also typically support SUV and large vehicle demand, which is beneficial to our Automotive business. 
Geographically, our largest exposure by far is the U.S., followed by Northern Europe. We produce in China, but the majority of that product is exported in either component form or in our customers finished product for consumption in North America or Europe. Chinese consumption patterns impact only about 3% of Leggett's total sales. Our automotive business is the only part of our portfolio that is meaningfully exposed to domestic Chinese demand, with about 20% of its revenue base remaining in that market.
While Chinese auto production slowed in 2015, the market still grew 3% or roughly in line with growth in both North America and Europe. As Karl mentioned earlier, our Automotive business grew its unit volume by 13% in 2015. 
Current automotive industry forecast anticipate production in the major markets to grow by approximately 4% in 2016. We expect to continue outperforming global auto production by at least 10 percentage points for the foreseeable future based upon content gains and new programs that we've been awarded. 
With this collective backdrop for 2016, we once again expect sales growth, which should lead to another year of strong margins and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, or flat to 5% higher than in 2015. 
Unit volume growth should be in the middle to high single digits, with continued strong demand in many of our product categories, an improvement expected in the majority of our end markets. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% to 3% reduction from commodity deflation and a 2% decrease from the Steel Tubing divestiture completed in late December. 
We expect 2016 earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.50. Bridging from 2015's strong earnings performance, this guidance assumes that unit volume growth will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins, but that benefit is expected to be largely offset by the nonrecurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13%, roughly in line with our 2015 performance. Our guidance assumes that commodity prices, primarily steel, stabilize near current levels. We expect to generate operating cash of approximately $450 million in 2016. Dividend should require about $175 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. 
Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of earnings. Actual payout has been higher in recent years and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. 
With our strong earnings growth in 2015, we are now comfortably within our targeted payout range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with our EPS growth. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must make stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

The way that I would encourage you to think about it is that in the fourth quarter, we recognized $15 million more in LIFO benefit than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. That was caused by the steel deflation that took place in November and December. Because of the timing of that deflation heading very late in the year and, in fact, in the back half of the quarter, a meaningful part of that $15 million increase in LIFO was not offset during the quarter and, in fact, will carry over into the early part of 2016 with a lot of that being in the first quarter. As you know, commodity moves impact LIFO pretty quickly, and it takes a little bit more time to work through the segments. We have to have usually a quarter, maybe a little bit more than that for the entire cost materials to roll through, and for us to get to a point where we can actually revalue our inventories. And neither of those things fully happened in the fourth quarter. So a part of it would have been offset, but not all of it. And that will, like I said, will carryover into the first quarter."

We will have some variation in the quarters because of the year-over-year deflation. I knew we've already said this, but we expect our unit volume growth to be strong again in 2016. We're looking at mid- to high single digit unit volume growth. We do expect deflation to offset part of that. And we now also have the impact from the divestiture. When you look at our current full year guidance at flat to 5% and compare that to the framework that we put out there in October, what's changed is basically the divestiture impact and maybe a little bit more deflation. Otherwise, we're basically in line with what we thought at the end of October. So taking that through the quarters, I would encourage you first to decide where you want to be in that full year flat to 5% range. And then in the first quarter, subtract 300 basis points from that full year growth rate. In the second quarter, subtract 100 basis points. And in the third and fourth quarters, add 200 basis points each. So at the midpoint of the guidance range, which would be about 2% to 3% growth in the first quarter, we'd be looking at sales that were flat to down 1%. In the second quarter, we'd be looking at sales that would be up 1% to 2%. And in each of the third and fourth quarters, we should be in the 4% to 5% up range. You didn't specifically ask about margins, but I'll go ahead and throw that in here too. Qualitatively, in the first half of 2016, we should be ahead of '15's EBIT margins in both the first and second quarter. Third and fourth quarters in '15, obviously, we had very strong margin performance in both of those quarters. We will likely be below those margin levels in the back half of the year with the full year margins essentially flat, which is what we already said. And I'll just reiterate that LIFO overhang, if you will, where the FIFO impact in the segments will most significantly impact our first quarter with the bulk of that being in our Residential segment with a little bit more in Industrial."

And to close the European business that was -- that acquisition was really strategic. And then to conclude divestitures to get us completely out of the Store Fixtures business, which will declare victory on that one to sell part of CVP and then on Christmas Eve to get the Steel Tubing divestiture done. All the while, they were looking at a number of acquisitions doing very deep dives. And now in 2016, continuing to look at some additional divestiture work and look at acquisitions. But I will say -- and we will be acquisitive. As a matter of fact, I have every expectation that we'll close a small aerospace acquisition later this month, but it's small. Our stated growth target, current stated growth target is 4% to 5%, or really 2x expectation of GDP growth. When we look at our strategic planned forecast for the next 3 years, so '16, '17 and '18, we're looking today at a greater than 7% CAGR. So 3x our expectation of GDP. So we feel really good about where we're positioned from an organic perspective. So that allows us to be very systemic in our analysis of acquisition. So you're right, we'll throw off a lot of cash. How we apply that cash will go through the normal usage. We'll continue to invest in organic growth. You see CapEx forecast for the first time a little bit above depreciation and amortization. That's an investment that we see in Automotive and continued growth in U.S. and European Comfort Core capability. We don't talk about Europe much. European spring had a fantastic quarter and is -- year has sold out. So long-winded answer, but we will continue to be acquisitive, but we have the luxury of continuing to be disciplined."

As we reported yesterday, we are extremely pleased with our 2015 results and expect continued strong performance in 2016. 
For the full year 2015, we achieved record sales from continuing operations, record EBIT and record earnings per share. Sales grew 4% for the year to $3.92 billion. Higher unit volume of 6% and acquisitions 3%, added 9% to sales growth. These improvements were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Full year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive. The continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs and strong growth in our adjustable beds. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, up 31% from $1.78 in the prior year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT grew 31% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 270 basis points to 12.9%. In the fourth quarter, sales from continuing operations were $945 million, down 1% from the prior year. Higher unit volume 3% and acquisitions 1%, added 4%, but were more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. 
Earnings performance was stronger than expected during the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.64 compared to $0.41 in the same quarter last year, for an increase of 56%. Adjusted earnings grew primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volume and lower stock compensation expense. Additional decreases in steel cost late in the year led to a larger than expected LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. While the LIFO impact is typically offset within the segments as the higher cost inventory flows through earnings, that offset did not fully occur in the fourth quarter. Because of the year-end timing of the cost decreases that triggered the additional benefit, part of the offset in segment-level impact will occur in early 2016. 
Fourth quarter EBIT -- adjusted EBIT increased 44% and adjusted EBIT margin improved to 13.8%, up 440 basis points over fourth quarter last year. 
Late in the year, we completed the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business, the final Store Fixtures operation, which had been reported in discontinued operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
Portfolio management will remain a strategic priority as we move forward. Over the past few years, we have enhanced our portfolio and improved our margins by growing our stronger-performing businesses and by exiting businesses that struggle to consistently deliver acceptable margins and returns.
Now on to the segment details. For the full year, margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volume grew in nearly all of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact offset some of this full year sales growth. 
For the fourth quarter, margins improved in 3 of the 4 segments, with Commercial Products segment margins flat with last year. Volume growth continued in many of our businesses, but the offsetting impact from commodity deflation and currency also continued throughout the quarter. 
In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 3%, with unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impacts. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 4%; innerspring unit volume grew 3%, with Comfort Core up 55% during the quarter; boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 10%; furniture component sales were down slightly, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 4%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. Volume also grew in Geo Components and decreased in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter from significantly lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT and EBIT margin improved primarily from pricing discipline, higher unit volumes and lower stock compensation expense.
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 5%. Higher unit volume and acquisitions increased sales by 10%, but were partially offset by the commodity deflation and currency impact. U.S. innerspring units grew 8%, with Comfort Core units up 51% for the full year. We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new Comfort Core products and our customers growing use of these components in their product lines. 
Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 11% and EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.2%, primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. 
In the Commercial Products segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 10%, primarily from an acquisition completed early in the year. Same location sales were down slightly, with unit volume growth and Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed more than offset by lower volume in Work Furniture and currency impact. Our acquisition in the segment was a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. The segment's EBIT increased slightly during the quarter, and EBIT margin was flat with the prior year. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 21%, with same location sales up 12%. Strong performance in our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove the majority of the same location sales growth. Adjustable Bed units grew 51% for the full year. The segment's EBIT increased 37% and EBIT margin improved 80 basis points to 6.8%, primarily from higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter sales were down 16% from steel related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire and Steel Tubing. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter with cost improvements partially offset by a $3 million loss on the divestiture of the Steel Tubing business. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 5% with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel related price reductions and lower trade sales from our rod mill. The segment's EBIT for the year increased 17%, and EBIT margin improved 120 basis points to 6.5%, as cost improvements more than offset an impairment charge of $6 million and divestiture loss of $3 million related to the Steel Tubing business. 
In the Specialized Products segment, fourth quarter sales increased 7% with a 12% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 14%, Machinery sales grew 15% and Commercial Vehicle Product sales were up 11%. Aerospace sales were down slightly in the quarter. The segment's EBIT increased, and EBIT margin improved 250 basis points, primarily from higher volume.
Full year total sales in the segment grew 4%, with a 9% volume increase partially offset by currency impact. Strong performance in our Automotive and Machinery businesses drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding the currency changes, automotive sales grew 13% for the full year. The segments EBIT increased 24% and EBIT margin improved 260 basis points to 16.3%, primarily from higher sales. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."

In 2015, we generated operating cash flow of $359 million, after paying $82 million to settle foam litigation. Full year cash flow came in slightly below our prior forecast due to the timing of the litigation payments, with a major part of those occurring just before year-end. The substantial majority of these cases have now been settled and paid. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales of 9.5%. 
In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $41.58, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $44.36 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
For the full year, we repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $45.72 and issued 2.2 million shares. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the year with net debt to net capital at 34.5%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At year-end, our debt was 1.5x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that just ended on December 31, 2015, we met our goal of producing top 1/3 TSR. We generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year over these past 3 years, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15% annual TSR for the same time per year. 
Before we discuss our 2016 guidance details, it may be helpful to remind everyone of the major macro drivers for our business. Consumer confidence is the primary indicator that we monitor since it most significantly influences demand for bedding and furniture. Total housing turnover also affects demand in these businesses, but to a lesser degree than consumer confidence. Broadly favorable trends in these 2 indicators should result in positive marketing conditions for at least half of our revenue base. Across our diversified businesses, we have no direct exposure to the oil industry. However, lower energy prices have historically been positive for demand in our residential markets, with consumers having more discretionary income available to spend on larger ticket purchases. Lower fuel prices also typically support SUV and large vehicle demand, which is beneficial to our Automotive business. 
Geographically, our largest exposure by far is the U.S., followed by Northern Europe. We produce in China, but the majority of that product is exported in either component form or in our customers finished product for consumption in North America or Europe. Chinese consumption patterns impact only about 3% of Leggett's total sales. Our automotive business is the only part of our portfolio that is meaningfully exposed to domestic Chinese demand, with about 20% of its revenue base remaining in that market.
While Chinese auto production slowed in 2015, the market still grew 3% or roughly in line with growth in both North America and Europe. As Karl mentioned earlier, our Automotive business grew its unit volume by 13% in 2015. 
Current automotive industry forecasts anticipate production in the major markets to grow by approximately 4% in 2016. We expect to continue outperforming global auto production by at least 10 percentage points for the foreseeable future based upon content gains and new programs that we've been awarded. 
With this collective backdrop for 2016, we once again expect sales growth, which should lead to another year of strong margins and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, or flat to 5% higher than in 2015. 
Unit volume growth should be in the middle to high single digits, with continued strong demand in many of our product categories, an improvement expected in the majority of our end markets. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% to 3% reduction from commodity deflation and a 2% decrease from the Steel Tubing divestiture completed in late December. 
We expect 2016 earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.50. Bridging from 2015's strong earnings performance, this guidance assumes that unit volume growth will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins, but that benefit is expected to be largely offset by the nonrecurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13%, roughly in line with our 2015 performance. Our guidance assumes that commodity prices, primarily steel, stabilize near current levels. We expect to generate operating cash of approximately $450 million in 2016. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. 
Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of earnings. Actual payout has been higher in recent years and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. 
With our strong earnings growth in 2015, we are now comfortably within our targeted payout range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with our EPS growth. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

The way that I would encourage you to think about it is that in the fourth quarter, we recognized $15 million more in LIFO benefit than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. That was caused by the steel deflation that took place in November and December. Because of the timing of that deflation hitting very late in the year and, in fact, in the back half of the quarter, a meaningful part of that $15 million increase in LIFO was not offset during the quarter and, in fact, will carry over into the early part of 2016 with a lot of that being in the first quarter. As you know, commodity moves impact LIFO pretty quickly, and it takes a little bit more time to work through the segments. We have to have usually a quarter, maybe a little bit more than that for those higher cost materials to roll through, and for us to get to a point where we can actually revalue our inventories. And neither of those things fully happened in the fourth quarter. So a part of it would have been offset, but not all of it. And that will, like I said, will carryover into the first quarter."

We will have some variation in the quarters because of the year-over-year deflation. I knew we've already said this, but we expect our unit volume growth to be strong again in 2016. We're looking at mid- to high single digit unit volume growth. We do expect deflation to offset part of that. And we now also have the impact from the divestiture. When you look at our current full year guidance at flat to 5% and compare that to the framework that we put out there in October, what's changed is basically the divestiture impact and maybe a little bit more deflation. Otherwise, we're basically in line with what we thought at the end of October. So taking that through the quarters, I would encourage you first to decide where you want to be in that full year flat to 5% range. And then in the first quarter, subtract 300 basis points from that full year growth rate. In the second quarter, subtract 100 basis points. And in the third and fourth quarters, add 200 basis points each. So at the midpoint of the guidance range, which would be about 2% to 3% growth in the first quarter, we'd be looking at sales that were flat to down 1%. In the second quarter, we'd be looking at sales that would be up 1% to 2%. And in each of the third and fourth quarters, we should be in the 4% to 5% up range. You didn't specifically ask about margins, but I'll go ahead and throw that in here too. Qualitatively, in the first half of 2016, we should be ahead of '15's EBIT margins in both the first and second quarter. Third and fourth quarters in '15, obviously, we had very strong margin performance in both of those quarters. We will likely be below those margin levels in the back half of the year with the full year margins essentially flat, which is what we already said. And I'll just reiterate that LIFO overhang, if you will, where the FIFO impact in the segments will most significantly impact our first quarter with the bulk of that being in our Residential segment with a little bit more in Industrial."

And then to conclude divestitures to get us completely out of the Store Fixtures business, which will declare victory on that one, to sell part of CVP and then on Christmas Eve to get the Steel Tubing divestiture done. All the while, they were looking at a number of acquisitions doing very deep dives. And now in 2016, continuing to look at some additional divestiture work and look at acquisitions. But I will say -- and we will be acquisitive. As a matter of fact, I have every expectation that we'll close a small aerospace acquisition later this month, but it's small. Our stated growth target, current stated growth target is 4% to 5%, or really 2x expectation of GDP growth. When we look at our strategic planned forecast for the next 3 years, so '16, '17 and '18, we're looking today at a greater than 7% CAGR, so 3x our expectation of GDP. So we feel really good about where we're positioned from an organic perspective. So that allows us to be very systemic in our analysis of acquisition. So you're right, we'll throw off a lot of cash. How we apply that cash will go through the normal usage. We'll continue to invest in organic growth. You see CapEx forecast for the first time a little bit above depreciation and amortization. That's an investment that we see in Automotive and continued growth in U.S. and European Comfort Core capability. We don't talk about Europe much. European spring had a fantastic quarter and this year has sold out. So long-winded answer, but we will continue to be acquisitive, but we have the luxury of continuing to be disciplined."

Before I start with my prepared comments, I want to stop for a second and congratulate and thanks, Susan McCoy. Yesterday marked the 30-year anniversary of her employment with the company. Susan, not only does an outstanding job as our Vice President of Investor Relations, she is also a trusted advisor to many of us and is truly an outstanding person. Congratulations and thank you, Susan from the shareholders and the investment community, our fellow employees and from me personally. 
We are very pleased with our start to 2016. EBIT and EBIT margins were ahead of our initial forecast despite short-term demand softness in a few of our residential end markets. For the full year, we expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, very strong EBIT margins and significant improvement in operating cash flow. As we reported yesterday, first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.63, up 26% from the $0.50 we posted in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and the nonrecurrence of a prior year Steel Tubing impairment charge. Sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $938 million from the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business and a small portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products in late 2015. 
Higher unit volume added 4% to sales growth in the quarter and acquisitions added 1%. These improvements were offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Strong sales growth continued in Automotive, Comfort Core and both the U.S. and Europe and Adjustable Bed. EBIT grew 14% and EBIT margin increased 190 basis points to 13.5% in the quarter, also benefiting from higher unit volume, improved operational efficiency and continued portfolio management. 
Now on to the segment details. In Residential Furnishings, first quarter sales were down 5%. Unit volume grew 2%, but was more than offset by raw material or related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales were down 2%, innerspring units decreased 7% and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core units up 15% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%. 
Furniture component sales were up 3%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 8% and motion hardware units volume down 6%. Volume also increased in Geo components. Segment EBIT and EBIT margins decreased in the quarter with the benefit from overall higher unit volume more than offset by FIFO inventory impacts and lower unit volumes in typically stronger margin businesses. The FIFO impact occurred, as expected from reducing selling prices, as we were consuming higher cost inventory on hand at the end of 2015. 
In the Commercial Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 7%, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed with units up 18% during the quarter, and continued strength in our Fashion Bed business. The Work Furniture acquisition completed in early 2015, also contributed 8% to the segment sales growth in the quarter. Segment EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 280 basis points to 8.5%, primarily from higher sales, operational improvements and a gain from the sale of a building. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales were down 19% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus first quarter last year from the divestiture of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter from the nonrecurrence of last year's Steel Tubing impairment along with cost and efficiency improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 10% with a 12% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11%, aerospace same location sales increased 7%, machinery sales grew 19% and commercial vehicle product same location sales were up 7%. The segment's EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 140 basis points primarily from higher volume. 
During the first quarter, we acquired a small U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies with annual sales of approximately $20 million. This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and also adds prescission machining to of our aerospace platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."

Our lower effective tax rate at $0.04 to first quarter earnings per share. This benefit resulted from adoption of our new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation that was just issued by the financial a",936,"Thanks, Karl, good morning, everyone. Our lower effective tax rate at $0.04 to first quarter earnings per share. This benefit resulted from adoption of our new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation that was just issued by the financial accounting standards board. The tax effect that arises when stock units or options are converted into shares will now be recognized, as an adjustment to income tax expenses instead of shareholders equity. While we have some of this activity in most quarters, the first quarter of each year is impacted to a greater degree due to the timing of issuances under our major stock compensation programs. As a result, we anticipate an approximate 28% tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters this year, which should average to a full year rate of 27%. 
Cash from operations was a very strong $111 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow increased $79 million versus first quarter last year, due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales and a seasonally normal 11.1%. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 45 years. And yesterday's closing price of $47.69, the current yield is 2.7%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock in first quarter at an average price of $43.75. And issued 1.1 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt to EBITDA. At the end of March, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer company on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year. 
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of $0.25 per year -- 25% per year. That performance places us within the top 10% of the S&P 500. 
As we look forward in 2016, we believe the key macro drivers for our markets remain favorable and positive trends continue in several of our businesses and product categories. With this backdrop, along with strong earnings in the first quarter, we've raised our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from containing operations of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Raising from 2015, this earnings guidance assumes that unit volume will grow -- will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins, but that benefit is expected to be partially offset by the nonrecurrence on the 2015 pricing lag. 
Sales guidance is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion or flat to 5% higher than 2015. This guidance assumes unit volume growth in the mid- to high single-digit. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% decrease from late 2015 divestitures and small acquisitions and approximate 2% reduction from commodity deflation. Steel scrap costs have begun to reinflate since beginning of the year, and we are implementing price increases in some of our businesses. As a result, full year sales guidance now reflects slightly less deflation than previously anticipated. We expect another year of very strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range we currently expect full year EBIT margin between 12.9% to 13.3%, which is flat to up slightly compared to 2015. 
In April, we settled a long standing antitrust claim and expect to receive $25 million of after-tax cash proceeds in the second quarter. This claim was primarily related to the prime form product business that we divested in 2007. The majority of the benefit of $0.15 per share will be recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit will be recognized in continuing operations during the second quarter. 
We expect to generate full year cash from operations of approximately $500 million, which includes the cash proceeds from the litigation settlement. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout have been higher until 2015, and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. However, recent growth in annual earnings, we are now comfortably within our targeted range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that for more closely align with our EPS growth. As has been our practice and for funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively acquisitions. Potential acquisition must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares, each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primary from employee benefit plans. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

Innerspring's volume in the first quarter of last year was up 15% from the previous year. We have those same headwinds in the second quarter with second quarter last year being up 17%. But a direct answer to your question. The first quarter was a little bit choppy. February was the softest. We think that it was correlated to a lesser tax refund season than is typical. March improved somewhat certainly compared to February, and through the first 3 weeks of April U.S. Spring sales are flat. So it with unit flat and the real favorable mix benefit that we have going forward, we were pretty bullish from a selling price perspective, as our customers start to launch their new product lines that are very heavily weighted to our technology."

Before I start with my prepared comments, I want to stop for a second and congratulate and thank Susan McCoy. Yesterday marked the 30-year anniversary of her employment with the company. Susan not only does an outstanding job as our Vice President of Investor Relations, she is also a trusted adviser to many of us and is truly an outstanding person. Congratulations and thank you, Susan, from the shareholders and the investment community, our fellow employees and from me, personally. 
We are very pleased with our start to 2016. EBIT and EBIT margins were ahead of our initial forecast despite short-term demand softness in a few of our residential end markets. For the full year, we expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, very strong EBIT margins and significant improvement in operating cash flow. As we reported yesterday, first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.63, up 26% from the $0.50 we posted in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and the nonrecurrence of a prior year steel tubing impairment charge. Sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $938 million from the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business and a small portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products in late 2015.
Higher unit volume added 4% to sales growth in the quarter and acquisitions added 1%. These improvements were offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Strong sales growth continued in Automotive, Comfort Core in both the U.S. and Europe, and Adjustable Bed. EBIT grew 14% and EBIT margin increased 190 basis points to 13.5% in the quarter, also benefiting from higher unit volume, improved operational efficiency and continued portfolio management. 
Now on to the segment details. In Residential Furnishings, first quarter sales were down 5%. Unit volume grew 2%, but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were down 2%, innerspring units decreased 7% and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core units up 15% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%.
Furniture component sales were up 3%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 8% and motion hardware units volume down 6%. Volume also increased in Geo Components. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased in the quarter with the benefit from overall higher unit volume more than offset by FIFO inventory impacts and lower unit volume in typically stronger margin businesses. The FIFO impact occurred, as expected, from reducing selling prices as we were consuming higher cost inventory on hand at the end of 2015. 
In the Commercial Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 7%, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed with units up 18% during the quarter, and continued strength in our Fashion Bed business. The Work Furniture acquisition completed in early 2015, also contributed 8% to the segment sales growth in the quarter. Segment EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 280 basis points to 8.5%, primarily from higher sales, operational improvements and a gain from the sale of a building. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales were down 19% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus first quarter last year from the divestiture of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter from the nonrecurrence of last year's Steel Tubing impairment along with cost and efficiency improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 10% with a 12% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11%, Aerospace same location sales increased 7%, Machinery sales grew 19%, and Commercial Vehicle Product same location sales were up 7%. The segment's EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 140 basis points primarily from higher volume. 
During the first quarter, we acquired a small U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies with annual sales of approximately $20 million. This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and also adds precision machining to of our aerospace platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."

A lower effective tax rate at $0.04 to first quarter earnings per share. This benefit resulted from adoption of our new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation that was just issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The tax effect that arises when stock units or options are converted into shares will now be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expenses instead of shareholders equity. While we have some of this activity in most quarters, the first quarter of each year is impacted to a greater degree due to the timing of issuances under our major stock compensation programs. As a result, we anticipate an approximate 28% tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters this year, which should average to a full year rate of 27%.
Cash from operations was a very strong $111 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow increased $79 million versus first quarter last year, due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales and a seasonally normal 11.1%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 45 years. And yesterday's closing price of $47.69, the current yield is 2.7%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock in first quarter at an average price of $43.75. And issued                                                    1.1 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt to EBITDA. At the end of March, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of $0.25 per year -- 25% per year. That performance places us within the top 10% of the S&P 500.
As we look forward in 2016, we believe the key macro drivers for our markets remain favorable and positive trends continue in several of our businesses and product categories. With this backdrop, along with strong earnings in the first quarter, we've raised our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from containing operations of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
Bridging from 2015, this earnings guidance assumes that unit volume will grow -- will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins, but that benefit is expected to be partially offset by the nonrecurrence on the 2015 pricing lag.
Sales guidance is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion or flat to 5% higher than 2015. This guidance assumes unit volume growth in the mid- to high single-digits. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% decrease from late 2015 divestitures, net of small acquisitions, and an approximate 2% reduction from commodity deflation. Steel scrap costs have begun to reinflate since the beginning of the year, and we are implementing price increases in some of our businesses. As a result, full year sales guidance now reflects slightly less deflation than previously anticipated. We expect another year of very strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin of between 12.9% to 13.3%, which is flat to up slightly compared to 2015.
In April, we settled a long standing antitrust claim and expect to receive $25 million of after-tax cash proceeds in the second quarter. This claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam Products business that we divested in 2007. The majority of the benefit, or $0.15 per share, will be recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit will be recognized in continuing operations during the second quarter.
We expect to generate full year cash from operations of approximately $500 million, which includes the cash proceeds from the litigation settlement. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout has been higher until 2015, and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. However, recent growth in annual earnings, we are now comfortably within our targeted range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that will more closely align with our EPS growth. As has been our practice and for funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily from employee benefit plans.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

Innerspring's volume in the first quarter of last year was up 15% from the previous year. We have those same headwinds in the second quarter, with second quarter last year being up 17%. But a direct answer to your question, the first quarter was a little bit choppy. February was the softest. We think that it was correlated to a lesser tax refund season than is typical. March improved somewhat certainly compared to February, and through the first 3 weeks of April, U.S. spring sales are flat. So it -- with unit flat, and the real favorable mix benefit that we have going forward, we were pretty bullish from a selling price perspective, as our customers start to launch their new product lines that are very heavily weighted to our technology."

Before I start with my prepared comments, I want to stop for a second and congratulate and thank Susan McCoy. Yesterday marked the 30-year anniversary of her employment with the company. Susan not only does an outstanding job as our Vice President of Investor Relations, she is also a trusted adviser to many of us and is truly an outstanding person. Congratulations and thank you, Susan, from the shareholders and the investment community, our fellow employees and from me, personally. 
We are very pleased with our start to 2016. EBIT and EBIT margins were ahead of our initial forecast despite short-term demand softness in a few of our residential end markets. For the full year, we expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, very strong EBIT margins and significant improvement in operating cash flow. As we reported yesterday, first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.63, up 26% from the $0.50 we posted in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and the nonrecurrence of a prior year steel tubing impairment charge. Sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $938 million from the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business and a small portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products in late 2015.
Higher unit volume added 4% to sales growth in the quarter and acquisitions added 1%. These improvements were offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 5%. Strong sales growth continued in Automotive, Comfort Core in both the U.S. and Europe, and Adjustable Bed. EBIT grew 14% and EBIT margin increased 190 basis points to 13.5% in the quarter, also benefiting from higher unit volume, improved operational efficiency and continued portfolio management. 
Now on to the segment details. In Residential Furnishings, first quarter sales were down 5%. Unit volume grew 2%, but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were down 2%, innerspring units decreased 7% and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core units up 15% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%.
Furniture component sales were up 3%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 8% and motion hardware units volume down 6%. Volume also increased in Geo Components. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased in the quarter with the benefit from overall higher unit volume more than offset by FIFO inventory impacts and lower unit volume in typically stronger margin businesses. The FIFO impact occurred, as expected, from reducing selling prices as we were consuming higher cost inventory on hand at the end of 2015. 
In the Commercial Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 7%, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed with units up 18% during the quarter, and continued strength in our Fashion Bed business. The Work Furniture acquisition completed in early 2015, also contributed 8% to the segment sales growth in the quarter. Segment EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 280 basis points to 8.5%, primarily from higher sales, operational improvements and a gain from the sale of a building. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter same location sales were down 19% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus first quarter last year from the divestiture of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter from the nonrecurrence of last year's Steel Tubing impairment along with cost and efficiency improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter same location sales increased 10% with a 12% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11%, Aerospace same location sales increased 7%, Machinery sales grew 19%, and Commercial Vehicle Product same location sales were up 7%. The segment's EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 140 basis points primarily from higher volume. 
During the first quarter, we acquired a small U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies with annual sales of approximately $20 million. This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and also adds precision machining to of our aerospace platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan."

A lower effective tax rate at $0.04 to first quarter earnings per share. This benefit resulted from adoption of our new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation that was just issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The tax effect that arises when stock units or options are converted into shares will now be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expenses instead of shareholders equity. While we have some of this activity in most quarters, the first quarter of each year is impacted to a greater degree due to the timing of issuances under our major stock compensation programs. As a result, we anticipate an approximate 28% tax rate for each of the remaining 3 quarters this year, which should average to a full year rate of 27%.
Cash from operations was a very strong $111 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow increased $79 million versus first quarter last year, due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales and a seasonally normal 11.1%.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 45 years. And yesterday's closing price of $47.69, the current yield is 2.7%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock in first quarter at an average price of $43.75. And issued                                                    1.1 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the first quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt to EBITDA. At the end of March, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of about 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of $0.25 per year -- 25% per year. That performance places us within the top 10% of the S&P 500.
As we look forward in 2016, we believe the key macro drivers for our markets remain favorable and positive trends continue in several of our businesses and product categories. With this backdrop, along with strong earnings in the first quarter, we've raised our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from containing operations of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
Bridging from 2015, this earnings guidance assumes that unit volume will grow -- will generate typical 25% to 30% incremental margins, but that benefit is expected to be partially offset by the nonrecurrence on the 2015 pricing lag.
Sales guidance is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion or flat to 5% higher than 2015. This guidance assumes unit volume growth in the mid- to high single-digits. As partial offsets to the volume growth, sales guidance includes a 2% decrease from late 2015 divestitures, net of small acquisitions, and an approximate 2% reduction from commodity deflation. Steel scrap costs have begun to reinflate since the beginning of the year, and we are implementing price increases in some of our businesses. As a result, full year sales guidance now reflects slightly less deflation than previously anticipated. We expect another year of very strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin of between 12.9% to 13.3%, which is flat to up slightly compared to 2015.
In April, we settled as plaintiff, a long standing antitrust claim and expect to receive $25 million of after-tax cash proceeds in the second quarter. This claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam Products business that we divested in 2007. The majority of the benefit, or $0.15 per share, will be recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit will be recognized in continuing operations during the second quarter.
We expect to generate full year cash from operations of approximately $500 million, which includes the cash proceeds from the litigation settlement. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until 2015, and as a result, dividend growth has been modest at about 3% per year. However, recent growth in annual earnings, we are now comfortably within our targeted payout range. This gives us greater flexibility to consider future dividend growth that will more closely align with our EPS growth. As has been our practice and for funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily from employee benefit plans.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

But a direct answer to your question, the first quarter was a little bit choppy. February was the softest. We think that it was correlated to a lesser tax refund season than is typical. March improved somewhat certainly compared to February, and through the first 3 weeks of April, U.S. spring sales are flat. So it -- with unit flat, and the real favorable mix benefit that we have going forward, we were pretty bullish from a selling price perspective, as our customers start to launch their new product lines that are very heavily weighted to our technology."

The second quarter, we will probably have that typical lag, where you start to see inflation. There's a 90-day lag before we can recover it. We should start to see normal spreads in the back half of the year.

We're allowing for the $0.03 benefit from the litigation settlement that Matt made mention of. Our overall margin framework has improved a little bit. We were previously thinking that we would be flattish, maybe down a bit from last year's 12.9 and now we're thinking 12.9 to maybe a few basis points higher than that, even with current guidance. And that essentially reflects the strong performance that we had in the first quarter and the fact that even though we had the FIFO carryover, as we would have expected in residential, much of that impact was offset with really strong operating improvements happening in our industrial segment and in commercial; some other parts of the company, too. So I think collectively those things are helping to bias modestly our overall margin view higher for the full year.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing o",856,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.72 and included a net $0.06 per share benefit from unusual items. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66, up 25% versus the $0.53 that we earned in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, favorable product mix, operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.
Second quarter sales decreased 4% to $959 million from divestitures and a 1% decline in same location sales. Unit volume grew 2% but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 3%. Adjusted EBIT grew 9% in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin increased 170 basis points to 13.8%. During the quarter, we settled as plaintiff, a long-standing antitrust claim and received cash proceeds of $38 million. Since this claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam business that we divested in 2007, the majority of the benefit was recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit related to our Carpet Cushion business and was recognized in continuing operations. 
Late in the quarter, we completed 2 small divestitures. The first was a wire products operation with annual sales of approximately $50 million. This divestiture was completed in early June and was part of the Industrial Materials segment. The second was a CVP operation with annual sales of approximately $30 million. This divestiture occurred in late June and was part of the Specialized Products segment. The $0.05 per share divestiture gain that we recognized in the second quarter related to this CVP transaction. The $0.02 per share goodwill impairment charge that we recognized in the quarter also related to the CVP business but was associated with the operation that remains. 
During the quarter, we purchased a minority interest in our automotive joint venture in China. This is a strong performing business that we have controlled and operated for several years, and we are pleased to now have full ownership. 
Now on to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, second quarter same location sales were down 6%. Unit volume decreased 2% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 4%. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency, were as follows: U.S. component dollars sales were flat; Innersprings units decreased 4%; and boxspring unit volume were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued, with Comfort Core units of 9% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%. Furniture component sales were down 6%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 2% and motion hardware unit volume down 18%. Volume also increased NGO components. 
The segment's reported EBIT included a $7 million benefit from the portion of the litigation settlement that was related to Carpet Cushion. Excluding this gain, segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter, with the impact from lower unit volume more than offset by pricing discipline, a favorable product mix within U.S. and European bedding and the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed, with those units being down 5% during the quarter. Adjustable Bed sales also were reflected a decrease in industry-wide AUSP as more product introductions are occurring at lower retail price points. Segment EBIT was flat and EBIT margin increased slightly, with operational improvements offsetting the impact from lower sales.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales were down 13% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015 and the second was the small wire products operation that I mentioned earlier. The segment's EBIT increased in the second quarter, primarily from operational improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. EBIT margins in the segment have improved significantly this year and were up 350 basis points to 11.1% in the second quarter. The segment's margins have structurally improved as a result of the divestitures.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 9%, with a 10% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 13%. Machinery sales grew 4% and commercial vehicle product same location sales were up 29%. The aerospace same location sales decreased 11% in the quarter. The segment's reported EBIT included an $11 million divestiture gain and a $4 million goodwill impairment charge, both related to CVP. Excluding these items, EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved 360 basis points, primarily from higher volume, currency benefits and cost reductions. I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of over $38 million of proceeds from the litigation settlement that Karl discussed. Operating cash flow also benefited from continued working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.4%. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.34 per share. This was our largest quarterly increase since 2007, and marked a $0.03 per share or 9.7% increase versus the second quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year but with earnings growth, we are now within our targeted payout range. At yesterday's closing price at $54.53, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprised the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $49.39, and issued 300,000 shares to employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the quarter, we renewed our bank facility, which supports our commercial paper program and increased the capacity to $750 million, up from $600 million previously. We also extended the maturity by 2 years to May 2021. At June 30, we had $467 million available under this program. We entered the second quarter with net debt to net capital at 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of June, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve DSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 27% per year. That performance places us within the top 6% of the S&P 500. 
As we announced yesterday, we are narrowing our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. This revised range includes the $0.06 per share of unusual items that we recognized in the second quarter, $0.03 of which was in our prior EPS range of $2.40 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates our 2016 sales to be roughly flat with 2015 at $3.9 billion. This assumes unit volume growth in the mid-single digits, offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions and a 2% decrease from commodity deflation and currency impact. We expect another year of strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 12.6% and 13.1%. Margins in the back half of the year are forecasted to be lower than our first half margins, primarily due to the expected pricing lag associated with passing through recent inflation in commodities. 
The 3 main assumptions that haven't changed from our prior guidance are: the level of unit volume growth; the divestiture impact on sales; and the tax rate. Unit volume growth is now expected to be at the lower end of our prior range, which was mid-to-high single digits growth. First half unit volume was roughly flat versus strong prior year comps. We expect unit volume to grow in the back half of the year. We also have more sales impact from divestitures following the 2 transactions that were completed in the second quarter. The $100 million decrease from the midpoint of our prior sales guidance is evenly split between lower unit volume growth and divestitures.
EPS guidance is also impacted by the lower unit volume growth assumption, but this is offset by an expected lower effective tax rate. This tax rate change is driven primarily by the new accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. The implied full year adjusted margin of approximately 13% is consistent with the margin derived from prior guidance at the mid-single-digit unit volume growth level. Full year cash from operations is now expected to exceed $500 million. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans. With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So there's an opportunity to continue, and this has always been the case to be mindful of any attractive growth opportunities that are coming through the M&A pipeline. Certainly, Karl can comment on how he views the pipeline looks like enough. But we just wanted him to take advantage of the market as it currently resides and make sure we have plenty of flexibility, and that really is the #1 driver behind that. And sure enough, we do anticipate that we'll have perhaps a bit more opportunity to look at some growth prospects, not that we haven't been looking at them all along but since so much of the divestiture work has now been done, that's kind of a natural opportunity it appears within the next 12 to 24 months.

This is basically the current guidance would say midpoint that we've got sort of the an approximate revenue guidance down 3.9. At this point, we would assume full year residential sales volume that would be down probably low single digits. We'll have some volume growth, we think, in the segment. But we also have some first half deflation. Not sure that that deflation is going to be completely overcome with price increases in the back half of the year. Commercial will be looking at up high single digits, combination of acquisition and some volume growth. Industrial is still looking to be down quite notably. And in fact, kind of mid-20s is where it would be. But keep in mind, that they're taking the largest hit from divestitures. So simple math would say 15%, 16% off just because of the divestitures and maybe 8% to 10% down organic, which is also a major reflection of steel deflation. And then specialized up high single digits with continued good growth across most of that segment. The margin profiles, interestingly enough, and it's similar to what we said before, they don't really look different from what we said last time. In fact, residential still 10% to 11% range, up slightly from where they were last year. Commercial, up 50 to 100 basis points from last year, which would put them in the 7% to 8% range. Industrial, 10% to 11%, which was up last year when images structurally a lot of improvement because of the divestitures. And then specialized up 100 basis points, still from where they were last year, which puts them in the high teens as well. So when you blend all that together, you're still closing in on about somewhere close to a 13% blended margin for overall."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.72 and included a net $0.06 per share benefit from unusual items. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66, up 25% versus the $0.53 that we earned in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, favorable product mix, operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.
Second quarter sales decreased 4% to $959 million from divestitures and a 1% decline in same location sales. Unit volume grew 2% but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 3%. Adjusted EBIT grew 9% in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin increased 170 basis points to 13.8%.
During the quarter, we settled as plaintiff, a long-standing antitrust claim and received cash proceeds of $38 million. Since this claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam business that we divested in 2007, the majority of the benefit was recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit related to our Carpet Cushion business and was recognized in continuing operations.
Late in the quarter, we completed 2 small divestitures. The first was a wire products operation with annual sales of approximately $50 million. This divestiture was completed in early June and was part of the Industrial Materials segment. The second was a CVP operation with annual sales of approximately $30 million. This divestiture occurred in late June and was part of the Specialized Products segment. The $0.05 per share divestiture gain that we recognized in the second quarter related to this CVP transaction. The $0.02 per share goodwill impairment charge that we recognized in the quarter also related to the CVP business but was associated with the operation that remains.
During the quarter, we purchased a minority interest in our automotive joint venture in China. This is a strong performing business that we have controlled and operated for several years, and we are pleased to now have full ownership.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, second quarter same location sales were down 6%. Unit volume decreased 2% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 4%. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency, were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were flat; innerspring units decreased 4%; and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core up 9% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%.
Furniture component sales were down 6%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 2%, and motion hardware unit volume down 18%. Volume also increased in Geo Components.
The segment's reported EBIT included a $7 million benefit from the portion of the litigation settlement that was related to Carpet Cushion. Excluding this gain, segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter, with the impact from lower unit volume more than offset by pricing discipline, a favorable product mix within U.S. and European bedding and the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed, with those units being down 5% during the quarter. Adjustable Bed sales also reflect a decrease in industry-wide AUSP as more product introductions are occurring at lower retail price points. Segment EBIT was flat and EBIT margin increased slightly, with operational improvements offsetting the impact from lower sales.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales were down 13% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015 and the second was the small wire products operation that I mentioned earlier. The segment's EBIT increased in the second quarter, primarily from operational improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. EBIT margins in the segment have improved significantly this year and were up 350 basis points to 11.1% in the second quarter. The segment's margins have structurally improved as a result of the divestitures.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 9%, with a 10% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 13%. Machinery sales grew 4% and Commercial Vehicle Product same location sales were up 29%. The Aerospace same location sales decreased 11% in the quarter. The segment's reported EBIT included an $11 million divestiture gain and a $4 million goodwill impairment charge, both related to CVP. Excluding these items, EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved 360 basis points, primarily from higher volume, currency benefits and cost reductions.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceed",877,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceeds from the litigation settlement that Karl discussed. Operating cash flow also benefited from continued working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.4%. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.34 per share. This was our largest quarterly increase since 2007, and marked a $0.03 per share or 9.7% increase versus the second quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year but with earnings growth, we are now within our targeted payout range. At yesterday's closing price of $54.53, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprised the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $49.39, and issued 300,000 shares to employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the quarter, we renewed our bank facility, which supports our commercial paper program and increased the capacity to $750 million, up from $600 million previously. We also extended the maturity by 2 years to May 2021. At June 30, we had $467 million available under this program. We entered the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of June, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 27% per year. That performance places us within the top 6% of the S&P 500.
As we announced yesterday, we are narrowing our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. This revised range includes the $0.06 per share of unusual items that we recognized in the second quarter, $0.03 of which was in our prior EPS range of $2.40 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates our 2016 sales to be roughly flat with 2015 at $3.9 billion. This assumes unit volume growth in the mid-single digits, offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions and a 2% decrease from commodity deflation and currency impact. We expect another year of strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 12.6% and 13.1%. Margins in the back half of the year are forecasted to be lower than our first half margins, primarily due to the expected pricing lag associated with passing through recent inflation in commodities.
The 3 main assumptions that haven't changed from our prior guidance are: the level of unit volume growth; the divestiture impact on sales; and the tax rate. Unit volume growth is now expected to be at the lower end of our prior range, which was mid- to high single digits growth. First half unit volume was roughly flat versus strong prior year comps. We expect unit volume to grow in the back half of the year. We also have more sales impact from divestitures following the 2 transactions that were completed in the second quarter. The $100 million decrease from the midpoint of our prior sales guidance is evenly split between lower unit volume growth and divestitures.
EPS guidance is also impacted by the lower unit volume growth assumption, but this is offset by an expected lower effective tax rate. This tax rate change is driven primarily by the new accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. The implied full year adjusted margin of approximately 13% is consistent with the margin derived from prior guidance at the mid-single-digit unit volume growth level. Full year cash from operations is now expected to exceed $500 million. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

So as the quarter continued, we continued to see scrap inflation that will manifest itself into -- on the flat products side, steel -- U.S. steel cost inflation in the third quarter, the forecast is about a 30% level. And we're now passing through pricing on the long products, the rod and wire. That impact we told you about last quarter that we had launched some of those increases. We continue to implement increases. There's not real good visibility as to how scrap is going to move in the back half of the year. It traded down slightly in July. We think August may be flat to slightly up bias. We'll see. But really what's happened, the way to think about it, Bobby, is that commodities deflation was a tailwind. And now inflation has turned into a bit of a headwind, remembering that we have about a 90-day lag of pass-through time."

This is steeped in basically the current guidance would say midpoint that we've got a sort of an approximate revenue guidance down 3.9. At this point, we would assume full year residential sales volume that would be down probably low single digits. We'll have some volume growth, we think, in the segment. But we also have some first half deflation. Not sure that that deflation is going to be completely overcome with price increases in the back half of the year. Commercial would be looking at up high single digits, combination of acquisition and some volume growth. Industrial is still looking to be down quite notably. And in fact, kind of mid-20s is where it would be. But keep in mind, that they're taking the largest hit from divestitures. So simple math would say 15%, 16% off just because of the divestitures and maybe 8% to 10% down organic, which is also a major reflection of steel deflation. And then specialized up high single digits with continued good growth across most of that segment. The margin profiles, interestingly enough, and it's similar to what we said before, those don't really look very different from what we said last time. In fact, residential still kind of 10% to 11% range, up slightly from where they were last year. Commercial, up 50 to 100 basis points from last year, which would put them in the 7% to 8% range. Industrial, 10% to 11% or so, which is up a lot from last year, when mentioned structurally a lot of improvement because of the divestitures. And then specialized up 100 basis points, still from where they were last year, which puts them in the high teens as well. So when you blend all that together, you're still closing them on about somewhere close to 13% blended margin for overall."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.72 and included a net $0.06 per share benefit from unusual items. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66, up 25% versus the $0.53 that we earned in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, favorable product mix, operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.
Second quarter sales decreased 4% to $959 million from divestitures and a 1% decline in same location sales. Unit volume grew 2% but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 3%. Adjusted EBIT grew 9% in the quarter, and adjusted EBIT margin increased 170 basis points to 13.8%.
During the quarter, we settled as plaintiff a long-standing antitrust claim and received cash proceeds of $38 million. Since this claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam business that we divested in 2007, the majority of the benefit was recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit related to our Carpet Cushion business and was recognized in continuing operations.
Late in the quarter, we completed 2 small divestitures. The first was a wire products operation with annual sales of approximately $50 million. This divestiture was completed in early June and was part of the Industrial Materials segment. The second was a CVP operation with annual sales of approximately $30 million. This divestiture occurred in late June and was part of the Specialized Products segment. The $0.05 per share divestiture gain that we recognized in the second quarter related to this CVP transaction. The $0.02 per share goodwill impairment charge that we recognized in the quarter also related to the CVP business but was associated with the operation that remains.
During the quarter, we purchased a minority interest in our automotive joint venture in China. This is a strong performing business that we have controlled and operated for several years, and we are pleased to now have full ownership.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, second quarter same location sales were down 6%. Unit volume decreased 2%, and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 4%. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency, were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were flat; innerspring units decreased 4%; and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core units up 9% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%.
Furniture component sales were down 6%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 2%, and motion hardware unit volume down 18%. Volume also increased in Geo Components.
The segment's reported EBIT included a $7 million benefit from the portion of the litigation settlement that was related to Carpet Cushion. Excluding this gain, segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter, with the impact from lower unit volume more than offset by pricing discipline, a favorable product mix within U.S. and European bedding and the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed, with those units being down 5% during the quarter. Adjustable Bed sales also reflect a decrease in industry-wide AUSP as more product introductions are occurring at lower retail price points. Segment EBIT was flat and EBIT margin increased slightly, with operational improvements offsetting the impact from lower sales.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales were down 13% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that I mentioned earlier. The segment's EBIT increased in the second quarter, primarily from operational improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. EBIT margins in the segment have improved significantly this year and were up 350 basis points to 11.1% in the second quarter. The segment's margins have structurally improved as a result of the divestitures.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 9%, with a 10% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 13%. Machinery sales grew 4%, and Commercial Vehicle Product same location sales were up 29%. The Aerospace same location sales decreased 11% in the quarter. The segment's reported EBIT included an $11 million divestiture gain and a $4 million goodwill impairment charge, both related to CVP. Excluding these items, EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved 360 basis points, primarily from higher volume, currency benefits and cost reductions.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter.

Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceeds from the litigation settlement that Karl discussed. Operating cash flow also benefited from continued working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.4%. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.34 per share. This was our largest quarterly increase since 2007 and marked a $0.03 per share, or 9.7% increase, versus the second quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year, but with earnings growth, we are now within our targeted payout range. At yesterday's closing price of $54.53, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprised the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $49.39, and issued 300,000 shares to employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the quarter, we renewed our bank facility, which supports our commercial paper program and increased the capacity to $750 million, up from $600 million previously. We also extended the maturity by 2 years to May 2021. At June 30, we had $467 million available under this program. We entered the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of June, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 27% per year. That performance places us within the top 6% of the S&P 500.
As we announced yesterday, we are narrowing our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. This revised range includes the $0.06 per share of unusual items that we recognized in the second quarter, $0.03 of which was in our prior EPS range of $2.40 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates our 2016 sales to be roughly flat with 2015 at $3.9 billion. This assumes unit volume growth in the mid-single digits, offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions and a 2% decrease from commodity deflation and currency impact. We expect another year of strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 12.6% and 13.1%. Margins in the back half of the year are forecasted to be lower than our first half margins, primarily due to the expected pricing lag associated with passing through recent inflation in commodities.
The 3 main assumptions that haven't changed from our prior guidance are: the level of unit volume growth; the divestiture impact on sales; and the tax rate. Unit volume growth is now expected to be at the lower end of our prior range, which was mid- to high single digits growth. First half unit volume was roughly flat versus strong prior year comps. We expect unit volume to grow in the back half of the year. We also have more sales impact from divestitures following the 2 transactions that were completed in the second quarter. The $100 million decrease from the midpoint of our prior sales guidance is evenly split between lower unit volume growth and divestitures.
EPS guidance is also impacted by the lower unit volume growth assumption, but this is offset by an expected lower effective tax rate. This tax rate change is driven primarily by the new accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. The implied full year adjusted margin of approximately 13% is consistent with the margin derived from prior guidance at the mid-single-digit unit volume growth level. Full year cash from operations is now expected to exceed $500 million. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

And how does that relate versus the Adjustables comment you made that was April was tough, and May and June is a little bit better."

The -- although we don't really provide color now on a period-by-period basis because it's so confusing with the different period ends amongst our customers and some of the information that's out there from an industry standpoint. But we did find it pretty choppy throughout the quarter. We had demand that was well below where we had earlier thought we would be. However, if you look at the quarter overall, in 2015, in innerspring volume, we were up 17% last year -- year-on-year. So this year being down about 4%, if you took the 2 years and put them together, it would be a 13% rise over 2014. If somebody had told me that 2 years ago, I would have been tickled."

But there had been some shifts within the market. We are seeing right now raw material, primarily steel, a delta in U.S. versus China pricing at a -- the highest level that I have seen. It's north of 40%. In some cases, on the flat steel, we're using mechanisms. We produce both here in U.S. and China, obviously. But the -- what that has caused is a shift of product being sourced out of China. Over the last 3, 4 months, we've seen a significant shift. Along with that, we've seen some down specking [ph] by some of the manufacturers and retailers and that they will take a product that may not be quite as high of quality as they had before, but it's still acceptable to them with that big delta in steel pricing. And we consistently are seeing business volumes that are generating below last year's numbers. And it's been that way pretty much for the full year."

Certainly, Karl can comment on how he views the pipeline looking right now.

Basically the current guidance would say midpoint that we've got a sort of an approximate revenue guidance down 3.9. At this point, we would assume full year residential sales volume that would be down probably low single digits. We'll have some volume growth, we think, in the segment. But we also have some first half deflation. Not sure that that deflation is going to be completely overcome with price increases in the back half of the year. Commercial would be looking at up high single digits, combination of acquisition and some volume growth. Industrial is still looking to be down quite notably. And in fact, kind of mid-20s is where it would be. But keep in mind, that they're taking the largest hit from divestitures. So simple math would say 15%, 16% off just because of the divestitures, and maybe 8% to 10% down organic, which is also a major reflection of steel deflation. And then specialized up high single digits with continued good growth across most of that segment. The margin profiles, interestingly enough, and it's similar to what we said before, those don't really look very different from what we said last time. In fact, residential still kind of 10% to 11% range, up slightly from where they were last year. Commercial, up 50 to 100 basis points from last year, which would put them in the 7% to 8% range. Industrial, 10% to 11% or so, which is up a lot from last year, we mentioned structurally a lot of improvement because of the divestitures. And then specialized up 100 basis points from where they were last year, which puts them in the high teens as well.

30760,374611772,1018459,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite softer-than-forecasted volume. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.72 and included a net $0.06 per share benefit from unusual items. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66, up 25% versus the $0.53 that we earned in the prior year. This increase reflects several factors, including higher unit volume, favorable product mix, operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.
Second quarter sales decreased 4% to $959 million from divestitures and a 1% decline in same location sales. Unit volume grew 2% but was more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 3%. Adjusted EBIT grew 9% in the quarter, and adjusted EBIT margin increased 170 basis points to 13.8%.
During the quarter, we settled as plaintiff a long-standing antitrust claim and received cash proceeds of $38 million. Since this claim was primarily related to the Prime Foam business that we divested in 2007, the majority of the benefit was recognized in discontinued operations. The remaining $0.03 per share benefit related to our Carpet Cushion business and was recognized in continuing operations.
Late in the quarter, we completed 2 small divestitures. The first was a wire products operation with annual sales of approximately $50 million. This divestiture was completed in early June and was part of the Industrial Materials segment. The second was a CVP operation with annual sales of approximately $30 million. This divestiture occurred in late June and was part of the Specialized Products segment. The $0.05 per share divestiture gain that we recognized in the second quarter related to this CVP transaction. The $0.02 per share goodwill impairment charge that we recognized in the quarter also related to the CVP business but was associated with the operation that remains.
During the quarter, we purchased a minority interest in our automotive joint venture in China. This is a strong performing business that we have controlled and operated for several years, and we are pleased to now have full ownership.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, second quarter same location sales were down 6%. Unit volume decreased 2%, and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 4%. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation in currency, were as follows: U.S. spring component dollar sales were flat; innerspring units decreased 4%; and boxspring unit volumes were down 6%. The favorable mix shift in innersprings continued with Comfort Core units up 9% during the quarter. International spring sales grew 6%.
Furniture component sales were down 6%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 2%, and motion hardware unit volume down 18%. Volume also increased in Geo Components.
The segment's reported EBIT included a $7 million benefit from the portion of the litigation settlement that was related to Carpet Cushion. Excluding this gain, segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter, with the impact from lower unit volume more than offset by pricing discipline, a favorable product mix within U.S. and European bedding and the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter same location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed, with those units being down 5% during the quarter. Adjustable Bed sales also reflect a decrease in industry-wide AUSP as more product introductions are occurring at lower retail price points. Segment EBIT was flat and EBIT margin increased slightly, with operational improvements offsetting the impact from lower sales.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter same location sales were down 13% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that I mentioned earlier. The segment's EBIT increased in the second quarter, primarily from operational improvements, partially offset by lower unit volume. EBIT margins in the segment have improved significantly this year and were up 350 basis points to 11.1% in the second quarter. The segment's margins have structurally improved as a result of the divestitures.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter same location sales increased 9%, with a 10% volume improvement partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 13%. Machinery sales grew 4%, and Commercial Vehicle Product same location sales were up 29%. The Aerospace same location sales decreased 11% in the quarter. The segment's reported EBIT included an $11 million divestiture gain and a $4 million goodwill impairment charge, both related to CVP. Excluding these items, EBIT grew and EBIT margins improved 360 basis points, primarily from higher volume, currency benefits and cost reductions.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
30760,374611772,1018459,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceed",877,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was a very strong $151 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased $56 million versus our second quarter last year, in part due to the collection of our $38 million of proceeds from the litigation settlement that Karl discussed. Operating cash flow also benefited from continued working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.4%. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.34 per share. This was our largest quarterly increase since 2007 and marked a $0.03 per share, or 9.7% increase, versus the second quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year, but with earnings growth, we are now within our targeted payout range. At yesterday's closing price of $54.53, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprised the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $49.39, and issued 300,000 shares to employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. During the quarter, we renewed our bank facility, which supports our commercial paper program and increased the capacity to $750 million, up from $600 million previously. We also extended the maturity by 2 years to May 2021. At June 30, we had $467 million available under this program. We entered the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 37%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of June, our debt was 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 27% per year. That performance places us within the top 6% of the S&P 500.
As we announced yesterday, we are narrowing our 2016 EPS guidance, and now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. This revised range includes the $0.06 per share of unusual items that we recognized in the second quarter, $0.03 of which was in our prior EPS range of $2.40 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates our 2016 sales to be roughly flat with 2015 at $3.9 billion. This assumes unit volume growth in the mid-single digits, offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions and a 2% decrease from commodity deflation and currency impact. We expect another year of strong margin performance. Based upon our guidance range, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 12.6% and 13.1%. Margins in the back half of the year are forecasted to be lower than our first half margins, primarily due to the expected pricing lag associated with passing through recent inflation in commodities.
The 3 main assumptions that haven't changed from our prior guidance are: the level of unit volume growth; the divestiture impact on sales; and the tax rate. Unit volume growth is now expected to be at the lower end of our prior range, which was mid- to high single digits growth. First half unit volume was roughly flat versus strong prior year comps. We expect unit volume to grow in the back half of the year. We also have more sales impact from divestitures following the 2 transactions that were completed in the second quarter. The $100 million decrease from the midpoint of our prior sales guidance is evenly split between lower unit volume growth and divestitures.
EPS guidance is also impacted by the lower unit volume growth assumption, but this is offset by an expected lower effective tax rate. This tax rate change is driven primarily by the new accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. The implied full year adjusted margin of approximately 13% is consistent with the margin derived from prior guidance at the mid-single-digit unit volume growth level. Full year cash from operations is now expected to exceed $500 million. Dividends should require about $175 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $130 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase 4 million to 5 million shares in 2016, and issue approximately 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave."

We continue to implement increases. There's not real good visibility as to how scrap is going to move in the back half of the year. It traded down slightly in July. We think August may be flat to slightly up bias. We'll see. But really what's happened, the way to think about it, Bobby, is that commodities deflation was a tailwind.

But the -- what that has caused is a shift of product being sourced out of China. Over the last 3, 4 months, we've seen a significant shift.

Certainly, Karl can comment on how he views the pipeline looking right now.

Basically the current guidance would say midpoint that we've got a sort of an approximate revenue guidance down 3.9. At this point, we would assume full year residential sales volume that would be down probably low single digits. We'll have some volume growth, we think, in the segment. But we also have some first half deflation. Not sure that that deflation is going to be completely overcome with price increases in the back half of the year. Commercial would be looking at up high single digits, combination of acquisition and some volume growth. Industrial is still looking to be down quite notably. And in fact, kind of mid-20s is where it would be. But keep in mind, that they're taking the largest hit from divestitures. So simple math would say 15%, 16% off just because of the divestitures, and maybe 8% to 10% down organic, which is also a major reflection of steel deflation. And then specialized up high single digits with continued good growth across most of that segment. The margin profiles, interestingly enough, and it's similar to what we said before, those don't really look very different from what we said last time. In fact, residential still kind of 10% to 11% range, up slightly from where they were last year. Commercial, up 50 to 100 basis points from last year, which would put them in the 7% to 8% range. Industrial, 10% to 11% or so, which is up a lot from last year, we mentioned structurally a lot of improvement because of the divestitures. And then specialized up 100 basis points from where they were last year, which puts them in the high teens as well. So when you blend all that together, you're still closing them on about somewhere close to 13% blended margin for overall."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing ope",696,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our third quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Third quarter sales decreased 6% to $949 million, with 4% of the reduction due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Same location sales were down 2% from slightly lower unit volume, raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Our third quarter EBIT decreased versus third quarter last year, primarily reflecting a lower year-over-year benefit from commodity deflation and lower unit volume. Third quarter EBIT margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year but was stronger-than-expected at 13.7%. 
Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.67 or flat with the same quarter last year. The EBIT decrease was offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and a reduced share count, both of which were in line with forecast. Given our third quarter results and lower current commodity cost, we have increased our full year EPS guidance on a lower sales outlook. 
Matt will discuss our 2016 guidance in a few minutes. Last month, at our Investor Day, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for our long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest revenue growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue to focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses. And therefore, expect to continue growing organically at a rate faster than our markets. Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should contribute modestly to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving TSR that ranks in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. 
Now to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, third quarter same location sales were down 8%. Unit volume decreased 6% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds represented 3% of the unit volume decrease. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 6%; innerspring units decreased 7%; and boxspring unit volume was down 9%; Comfort Core units decreased 2% during the quarter; International Spring sales decreased 3%; furniture component sales were down 5%, with sales in the Sophos sleep businesses down 7%; and motion hardware volume, down 2%. 
The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume, largely offset by pricing discipline. EBIT margin improved in part to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales. 
In the Commercial Products segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 4%. Growth and Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales and Adjustable Bed with those units down 10% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased slightly, primarily from lower volumes. In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales were down 8% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume and Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that we sold in the second quarter. The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily from lower unit volume. EBIT margin improved 110 basis points to 9%, in part for divesting lower margin businesses. In specialized product segments, third quarter same-location sales increased 6% from continued strength in automotive. Excluding minor currency changes, automotive sales grew 14%, machine resales decreased 5% and aerospace sales same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points, primarily from higher volume and currency benefits. I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
30760,378258490,1064910,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entere",738,"Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million. 
Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.8%. With strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we now expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million. As uses of cash for the full year, dividends should require about $175 million and capital expenditures should approximate $125 million. In August, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a 6.3% increase versus the third quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year. But with our strong earnings growth, we are now within the targeted payout range. Accordingly, future dividend growth should more closely align with earnings growth. 
At yesterday's closing price of $44.39, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. During the third quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $52.77; and issued 800,000 shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of $46.47; and issued 2.2 million shares. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 36%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. 
At the end of September, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBIT. We assessed our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR at the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
For the 3 year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 17% per year. That performance places us within the top 14% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance. We now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.62 per share versus our prior EPS range of $2.45 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates 2016 sales of approximately $3.75 billion or a 4% decrease from 2015. This assumes approximately 2% unit volume growth; offset by 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions; and a 3% decrease from commodity deflation and currency. 
Prior guidance anticipates sales of approximately $3.9 billion on mid-single-digit unit volume growth and slightly less impact from commodity deflation. Our implied fourth quarter EPS guidance range is now $0.53 to $0.60 on sales of approximately $900 million. We expect to close the year with strong margin performance. 
Based upon our guidance range, the full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 13.3% and 13.7%. The 2 main changes in our full year EPS guidance are: one, the lower expected level of unit volume growth; and two, an offsetting benefit from lower-than-expected steel prices. Both of which were also reflected in our strong third quarter EPS performance.
In our July forecast, we assume that the second quarter steel cost inflation would hold through the remainder of the year. Therefore, our prior guidance reflected short-term earnings and margin pressure from the typical pricing lag associated with passing along higher costs. Instead of inflation holding, market prices for certain types of steel actually began to deflate as the third quarter progress. Our updated full year EPS guidance now assumes less benefit from unit volume growth, but that impact is offset by lower commodity cost. With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

And that was generally the mood that although we do furniture business, there seems to be a little momentum building right now, but it has been kind of a tough slub there. In Bedding, we really do have some tough comps with last year. As an example, we reported here a 2% drop in our Comfort Core volume, which had been in a pretty much on a for the last couple of years. We're kind of lapping some strong numbers last year. And if you look at the increase in Comfort Core in the fourth -- in the third quarter of '15 as opposed to the third quarter of '14, we were up 37%.

You touched on a couple of independent variables. To think about we don't know when we have sustained inflation that at some point, we would expect to encounter some, and that would typically give us a little better of short-term margin headwind that we'd have to deal with for a while. Our tax rate this year is at 25%, it's probably lower than where we will in the next year. Something in the 27% to 28% range would be a reasonable range to start thinking about. And you'll remember that we also last quarter have $0.06 of unusual things that are embedded in the $2.55 to $2.62 continuing ops guidance. So from there, it goes to top line. And like I said, we'll create some framework around that after we get another quarter behind us. Get a better look at forecast and then try to get a feel for where we think next year will go. Understand that the 2019 framework that we put out there, as I know you do, is clearly a little bit longer-term.

We expected that there would be inflation off of that. It did not take place. Actually scrap traded down about $20 a ton in September and now $20 in October. So there is a little bit of softness at the current price of scrap. Scrap probably won't be collected. So hopefully, into 2017, that there will be a resurgence in demand. There will be an equalization of pricing. As odd as it sounds, we badly want inflation. Admittedly, there's a 90-day lag on pass-through.

Some of that was a pull forward by large customer of ours that was about to go through in ERP implementation, so they pulled forward some 4Q '15 volume into 3Q '15. So that made that comp that much tougher. There's no question that we're being impacted by soft market demand. We're also going through a conversion of adjustables being sold through OEM mattress manufacturers and taken out that inefficiency and now being sold directly to retail. So therefore, you should see significantly fewer adjustable sold through the residential side of the business, which as the commentary previous status of those, as you know, those were just passed-through sales with very little margin impacts. On the residential side, certainly, there were a lot of sales dollars associated with that. The product is manufactured in the commercial segment, will now primarily be sold out in the commercial segment. And we're going through this transition where we're ramping down inventories at the OEM side, ramping up inventories at the direct retail.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Third quarter sales decreased 6% to $949 million, with 4% of the reduction due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Same-location sales were down 2% from slightly lower unit volume, raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Our third quarter EBIT decreased versus third quarter last year, primarily reflecting a lower year-over-year benefit from commodity deflation and lower unit volume. Third quarter EBIT margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year but was stronger-than-expected at 13.7%.
Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.67 or flat with the same quarter last year. The EBIT decrease was offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and a reduced share count, both of which were in line with forecast. Given our third quarter results and lower current commodity cost, we have increased our full year EPS guidance on a lower sales outlook.
Matt will discuss our 2016 guidance in a few minutes. Last month, at our Investor Day, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for a long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest revenue growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue to focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses. And therefore, expect to continue growing organically at a rate faster than our markets. Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should contribute modestly to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving TSR that ranks in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500.
Now to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, third quarter same-location sales were down 8%. Unit volume decreased 6% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds represented 3% of the unit volume decrease.
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 6%; innerspring units decreased 7%; and boxspring unit volume was down 9%; Comfort Core units decreased 2% during the quarter; International Spring sales decreased 3%; furniture component sales were down 5%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses down 7%; and motion hardware unit volume, down 2%.
The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume, largely offset by pricing discipline. EBIT margin improved in part to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the Commercial Products segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed with those units down 10% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased slightly, primarily from lower volume.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales were down 8% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume and Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that we sold in the second quarter. The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily from lower unit volume. EBIT margin improved 110 basis points to 9%, in part from divesting lower margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 6% from continued strength in automotive. Excluding minor currency changes, automotive sales grew 14%, machinery sales decreased 5% and aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points, primarily from higher volume and currency benefits.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered",738,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.
Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.8%. With strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we now expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million. As uses of cash for the full year, dividends should require about $175 million and capital expenditures should approximate $125 million. In August, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a 6.3% increase versus the third quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year. But with our strong earnings growth, we are now within the targeted payout range. Accordingly, future dividend growth should more closely align with earnings growth.
At yesterday's closing price of $44.39, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500s dividend aristocrats. During the third quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $52.77; and issued 800,000 shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of $46.47; and issued 2.2 million shares. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the third quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA.
At the end of September, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 17% per year. That performance places us within the top 14% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance. We now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.62 per share versus our prior EPS range of $2.45 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates 2016 sales of approximately $3.75 billion or a 4% decrease from 2015. This assumes approximately 2% unit volume growth; offset by 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions; and a 3% decrease from commodity deflation and currency.
Prior guidance anticipated sales of approximately $3.9 billion on mid-single-digit unit volume growth and slightly less impact from commodity deflation. Our implied fourth quarter EPS guidance range is now $0.53 to $0.60 on sales of approximately $900 million. We expect to close the year with strong margin performance.
Based upon our guidance range, the full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 13.3% and 13.7%. The 2 main changes in our full year EPS guidance are: one, the lower expected level of unit volume growth; and two, an offsetting benefit from lower-than-expected steel prices. Both of which were also reflected in our strong third quarter EPS performance.
In our July forecast, we assume that the second quarter steel cost inflation would hold through the remainder of the year. Therefore, our prior guidance reflected short-term earnings and margin pressure from the typical pricing lag associated with passing along higher costs. Instead of inflation holding, market prices for certain types of steel actually began to deflate as the third quarter progressed. Our updated full year EPS guidance now assumes less benefit from unit volume growth, but that impact is offset by lower commodity costs. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

We -- things are a little bit tough at retail, just was at the High Point Furniture market over the weekend. And that was generally the mood that although in the furniture business, there seems to be a little momentum building right now, but it has been kind of a tough slog there. In Bedding, we really do have some tough comps with last year. As an example, we reported here a 2% drop in our Comfort Core volume, which had been on a pretty much a tear for the last couple of years. We're kind of lapping some strong numbers last year. And if you look at the increase in Comfort Core in the fourth -- in the third quarter of '15 as opposed to the third quarter of '14, we were up 37%. So being down 2% here, while that's not where we want to be, obviously, it's still indicative of some of the pretty tough comps what we have."

You touched on a couple of independent variables. To think about, we don't know when we'll have sustained inflation that at some point, we would expect to encounter some, and that would typically give us a little better of short-term margin headwind that we'd have to deal with for a while. Our tax rate this year is at 25%, it's probably lower than where we will in the next year. Something in the 27% to 28% range would be a reasonable place to start thinking about. And you'll remember that we also last quarter had $0.06 of unusual things that are -- they're embedded in the $2.35 to $2.62 continuing ops guidance. And so from there it goes to top line. And like I said, we'll create some framework around that after we get another quarter behind us. Get a better look at forecasts and try to get a feel for where we think next year will go. I understand that the 2019 framework that we put out there, as I know you do, is clearly a little bit longer term. And to the comments that Karl had in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about kind of the  macro backdrop, being supportive of reasonable health in our markets. And the things that we've been doing on the content front in auto and bedding and category growth and adjustables, and the things -- other things that we highlighted at Investor Day, we still have confidence in our ability to make those things happen over the next 2 to 3 years."

Susan's commentary on an expectation of ultimate inflation is kind of steeped in the thought process that it can't go much lower at this point, you know that we had a little bit of head fake on steel, where scrap traded up little north of $50 a ton in the second quarter. We expected that there would be inflation off of that. It did not take place. Actually scrap traded down about $20 a ton in September and now $20 in October. So there is a little bit of softness. At the current price of scrap, scrap probably won't be collected, so hopefully, into 2017, that there will be a resurgence in demand. There'll be an equalization of pricing. As odd as it sounds, we badly want inflation that admittedly, there's a 90-day lag on pass-through.

Some of that was a pull forward by large customer of ours that was about to go through in ERP implementation, so they pulled forward some 4Q '15 volume into 3Q '15. So that made that comp that much tougher. There's no question that we're being impacted by soft market demand. We're also going through a conversion of adjustables being sold through OEM mattress manufacturers and taking out that inefficiency and now being sold directly to retail. So therefore, you should see significantly fewer adjustable sold through the residential side of the business, which as the commentary previous stated that those, as you know, those were just pass-through sales at very little margin impact on the residential side, but certainly there were a lot of sales dollars associated with that. The product is manufactured in the commercial segment, will now primarily be sold out of the commercial segment. And we're going through this transition where we're ramping down the inventories at the OEM side, ramping up inventories at the direct retail. So mix that all together, we have not lost share, by the way, at the low end, you made reference there that there's no question that AUSPs are dropping in adjustables, which is probably a good thing for the business from a long-term perspective then that it means longer term, there'll be more units sold.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Third quarter sales decreased 6% to $949 million, with 4% of the reduction due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Same-location sales were down 2% from slightly lower unit volume, raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Our third quarter EBIT decreased versus third quarter last year, primarily reflecting a lower year-over-year benefit from commodity deflation and lower unit volume. Third quarter EBIT margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year but was stronger-than-expected at 13.7%.
Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.67 or flat with the same quarter last year. The EBIT decrease was offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and a reduced share count, both of which were in line with forecast. Given our third quarter results and lower current commodity cost, we have increased our full year EPS guidance on a lower sales outlook.
Matt will discuss our 2016 guidance in a few minutes. Last month, at our Investor Day, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for a long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest revenue growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue to focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses. And therefore, expect to continue growing organically at a rate faster than our markets. Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should contribute modestly to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving TSR that ranks in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500.
Now to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, third quarter same-location sales were down 8%. Unit volume decreased 6% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds represented 3% of the unit volume decrease.
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 6%; innerspring units decreased 7%; and boxspring unit volume was down 9%; Comfort Core units decreased 2% during the quarter; International Spring sales decreased 3%; furniture component sales were down 5%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses down 7%; and motion hardware unit volume, down 2%.
The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume, largely offset by pricing discipline. EBIT margin improved in part to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the Commercial Products segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed with those units down 10% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased slightly, primarily from lower volume.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales were down 8% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume and Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that we sold in the second quarter. The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily from lower unit volume. EBIT margin improved 110 basis points to 9%, in part from divesting lower margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 6% from continued strength in automotive. Excluding minor currency changes, automotive sales grew 14%, machinery sales decreased 5% and aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points, primarily from higher volume and currency benefits.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered",739,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.
Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.8%. With strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we now expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million. As uses of cash for the full year, dividends should require about $175 million and capital expenditures should approximate $125 million. In August, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a 6.3% increase versus the third quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year. But with our strong earnings growth, we are now within the targeted payout range. Accordingly, future dividend growth should more closely align with earnings growth.
At yesterday's closing price of $44.39, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500s dividend aristocrats. During the third quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $52.77; and issued 800,000 shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of $46.47; and issued 2.2 million shares. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the third quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA.
At the end of September, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 17% per year. That performance places us within the top 14% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance. We now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.62 per share versus our prior EPS range of $2.45 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates 2016 sales of approximately $3.75 billion or a 4% decrease from 2015. This assumes approximately 2% unit volume growth; offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions; and a 3% decrease from commodity deflation and currency.
Prior guidance anticipated sales of approximately $3.9 billion on mid-single-digit unit volume growth and slightly less impact from commodity deflation. Our implied fourth quarter EPS guidance range is now $0.53 to $0.60 on sales of approximately $900 million. We expect to close the year with strong margin performance.
Based upon our guidance range, the full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 13.3% and 13.7%. The 2 main changes in our full year EPS guidance are: one, the lower expected level of unit volume growth; and two, an offsetting benefit from lower-than-expected steel prices. Both of which were also reflected in our strong third quarter EPS performance.
In our July forecast, we assume that the second quarter steel cost inflation would hold through the remainder of the year. Therefore, our prior guidance reflected short-term earnings and margin pressure from the typical pricing lag associated with passing along higher costs. Instead of inflation holding, market prices for certain types of steel actually began to deflate as the third quarter progressed. Our updated full year EPS guidance now assumes less benefit from unit volume growth, but that impact is offset by lower commodity costs. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

We -- things are a little bit tough at retail, just was at the High Point Furniture market over the weekend. And that was generally the mood that although in the furniture business, there seems to be a little momentum building right now, but it has been kind of a tough slog there. In Bedding, we really do have some tough comps with last year. As an example, we reported here a 2% drop in our Comfort Core volume, which had been on a pretty much a tear for the last couple of years. We're kind of lapping some strong numbers last year. And if you look at the increase in Comfort Core in the fourth -- in the third quarter of '15 as opposed to the third quarter of '14, we were up 37%. So being down 2% here, while that's not where we want to be, obviously, it's still indicative of some of the pretty tough comps what we have."

You touched on a couple of the independent variables. To think about, we don't know when we'll have sustained inflation that at some point, we would expect to encounter some, and that would typically give us a little bit of short-term margin headwind that we'd have to deal with for a while. Our tax rate this year is at 25%, it's probably lower than where we will end next year. Something in the 27% to 28% range would be a reasonable place to start thinking about. And you'll remember that we also last quarter had $0.06 of unusual things that are -- they're embedded in the $2.55 to $2.62 continuing ops guidance. And so from there it goes to top line. And like I said, we'll create some framework around that after we get another quarter behind us. Get a better look at forecasts and try to get a feel for where we think next year will go. I understand that the 2019 framework that we put out there, as I know you do, is clearly a little bit longer term. And to the comments that Karl had in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about kind of the macro backdrop, being supportive of reasonable health in our markets. And the things that we've been doing on the content front in auto and bedding and category growth and adjustables, and the things -- other things that we highlighted at Investor Day, we still have confidence in our ability to make those things happen over the next 2 to 3 years."

We expected that there would be inflation off of that. It did not take place. Actually scrap traded down about $20 a ton in September and now $20 in October. So there is a little bit of softness. At the current price of scrap, scrap probably won't be collected, so hopefully, into 2017, that there will be a resurgence in demand. There'll be an equalization of pricing. As odd as it sounds, we badly want inflation that admittedly, there's a 90-day lag on pass-through.

We need inflation, and we expect it to some degree next year, but to predict timing is a real challenge."

Some of that was a pull forward by a large customer of ours that was about to go through an ERP implementation, so they pulled forward some 4Q '15 volume into 3Q '15. So that made that comp that much tougher. There's no question that we're being impacted by soft market demand. We're also going through a conversion of adjustables being sold through OEM mattress manufacturers and taking out that inefficiency and now being sold directly to retail. So therefore, you should see significantly fewer adjustable sold through the residential side of the business, which as the commentary previous stated that those, as you know, those were just pass-through sales at very little margin impact on the residential side, but certainly there were a lot of sales dollars associated with that. The product is manufactured in the commercial segment, will now primarily be sold out of the commercial segment. And we're going through this transition where we're ramping down inventories at the OEM side, ramping up inventories at the direct retail. So mix that all together, we have not lost share, by the way, at the low end, you made reference there that there's no question that AUSPs are dropping in adjustables, which is probably a good thing for the business from a long-term perspective then that it means longer term, there'll be more units sold.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong earnings despite lower-than-anticipated sales. For the full year, we continue to expect record earnings per share from continuing operations, strong EBIT margins and a significant improvement in operating cash flow.
Third quarter sales decreased 6% to $949 million, with 4% of the reduction due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Same-location sales were down 2% from slightly lower unit volume, raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Our third quarter EBIT decreased versus third quarter last year, primarily reflecting a lower year-over-year benefit from commodity deflation and lower unit volume. Third quarter EBIT margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year but was stronger-than-expected at 13.7%.
Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.67 or flat with the same quarter last year. The EBIT decrease was offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and a reduced share count, both of which were in line with forecast. Given our third quarter results and lower current commodity cost, we have increased our full year EPS guidance on a lower sales outlook.
Matt will discuss our 2016 guidance in a few minutes. Last month, at our Investor Day, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for a long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest revenue growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue to focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses. And therefore, expect to continue growing organically at a rate faster than our markets. Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should contribute modestly to long-term TSR and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving TSR that ranks in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500.
Now to the segments. In Residential Furnishings, third quarter same-location sales were down 8%. Unit volume decreased 6% and raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. Lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds represented 3% of the unit volume decrease.
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 6%; innerspring units decreased 7%; and boxspring unit volume was down 9%; Comfort Core units decreased 2% during the quarter; International Spring sales decreased 3%; furniture component sales were down 5%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses down 7%; and motion hardware unit volume, down 2%.
The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter with the impact from lower unit volume, largely offset by pricing discipline. EBIT margin improved in part to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the Commercial Products segment, third quarter same-location sales decreased 4%. Growth in Work Furniture was more than offset by lower sales in Adjustable Bed with those units down 10% during the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased slightly, primarily from lower volume.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter same-location sales were down 8% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume and Drawn Wire. Total sales also decreased versus the prior year from 2 divestitures. The first was the Steel Tubing business that we sold in late 2015, and the second was the small wire products operation that we sold in the second quarter. The segment's EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily from lower unit volume. EBIT margin improved 110 basis points to 9%, in part from divesting lower margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter same-location sales increased 6% from continued strength in automotive. Excluding minor currency changes, automotive sales grew 14%, machinery sales decreased 5% and aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points, primarily from higher volume and currency benefits.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered",739,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was once again strong during the quarter at $124 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $386 million.
Operating cash flow continues to benefit from working capital management. We entered the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 10.8%. With strong year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we now expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million. As uses of cash for the full year, dividends should require about $175 million and capital expenditures should approximate $125 million. In August, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a 6.3% increase versus the third quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings. Actual payout had been higher until last year. But with our strong earnings growth, we are now within the targeted payout range. Accordingly, future dividend growth should more closely align with earnings growth.
At yesterday's closing price of $44.39, the current yield is 3.1%, which is one of the higher yields among the 50 companies that comprise the S&P 500s dividend aristocrats. During the third quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $52.77; and issued 800,000 shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average price of $46.47; and issued 2.2 million shares. As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We entered the third quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, well within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA.
At the end of September, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2016, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 17% per year. That performance places us within the top 14% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance. We now expect record full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.62 per share versus our prior EPS range of $2.45 to $2.60. Full year guidance now anticipates 2016 sales of approximately $3.75 billion or a 4% decrease from 2015. This assumes approximately 2% unit volume growth; offset by a 3% reduction from divestitures, net of small acquisitions; and a 3% decrease from commodity deflation and currency.
Prior guidance anticipated sales of approximately $3.9 billion on mid-single-digit unit volume growth and slightly less impact from commodity deflation. Our implied fourth quarter EPS guidance range is now $0.53 to $0.60 on sales of approximately $900 million. We expect to close the year with strong margin performance.
Based upon our guidance range, the full year adjusted EBIT margin should be between 13.3% and 13.7%. The 2 main changes in our full year EPS guidance are: one, the lower expected level of unit volume growth; and two, an offsetting benefit from lower-than-expected steel prices. Both of which were also reflected in our strong third quarter EPS performance.
In our July forecast, we assume that the second quarter steel cost inflation would hold through the remainder of the year. Therefore, our prior guidance reflected short-term earnings and margin pressure from the typical pricing lag associated with passing along higher costs. Instead of inflation holding, market prices for certain types of steel actually began to deflate as the third quarter progressed. Our updated full year EPS guidance now assumes less benefit from unit volume growth, but that impact is offset by lower commodity costs. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

We -- things are a little bit tough at retail, just was at the High Point Furniture market over the weekend. And that was generally the mood that although in the furniture business, there seems to be a little momentum building right now, but it has been kind of a tough slog there. In Bedding, we really do have some tough comps with last year. As an example, we reported here a 2% drop in our Comfort Core volume, which had been on a pretty much a tear for the last couple of years. We're kind of lapping some strong numbers last year. And if you look at the increase in Comfort Core in the fourth -- in the third quarter of '15 as opposed to the third quarter of '14, we were up 37%. So being down 2% here, while that's not where we want to be, obviously, it's still indicative of some of the pretty tough comps what we have."

You touched on a couple of the independent variables. To think about, we don't know when we'll have sustained inflation that at some point, we would expect to encounter some, and that would typically give us a little bit of short-term margin headwind that we'd have to deal with for a while. Our tax rate this year is at 25%, it's probably lower than where we will end next year. Something in the 27% to 28% range would be a reasonable place to start thinking about. And you'll remember that we also last quarter had $0.06 of unusual things that are -- they're embedded in the $2.55 to $2.62 continuing ops guidance. And so from there it goes to top line. And like I said, we'll create some framework around that after we get another quarter behind us. Get a better look at forecasts and try to get a feel for where we think next year will go. I understand that the 2019 framework that we put out there, as I know you do, is clearly a little bit longer term. And to the comments that Karl had in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about kind of the macro backdrop, being supportive of reasonable health in our markets.

Steel is really tough for us to forecast. Susan's commentary on an expectation of ultimate inflation is kind of steeped in the thought process that it can't go much lower at this point, you know that we had a little bit of a head fake on steel, where scrap traded up little north of $50 a ton in the second quarter. We expected that there would be inflation off of that. It did not take place. Actually scrap traded down about $20 a ton in September and now $20 in October. So there is a little bit of softness. At the current price of scrap, scrap probably won't be collected, so hopefully, into 2017, that there will be a resurgence in demand. There'll be an equalization of pricing. As odd as it sounds, we badly want inflation that admittedly, there's a 90-day lag on pass-through.

Some of that was a pull forward by a large customer of ours that was about to go through an ERP implementation, so they pulled forward some 4Q '15 volume into 3Q '15. So that made that comp that much tougher. There's no question that we're being impacted by soft market demand. We're also going through a conversion of adjustables being sold through OEM mattress manufacturers and taking out that inefficiency and now being sold directly to retail. So therefore, you should see significantly fewer adjustable sold through the residential side of the business, which as the commentary previous stated that those, as you know, those were just pass-through sales at very little margin impact on the residential side, but certainly there were a lot of sales dollars associated with that. The product is manufactured in the commercial segment, will now primarily be sold out of the commercial segment. And we're going through this transition where we're ramping down inventories at the OEM side, ramping up inventories at the direct retail. So mix that all together, we have not lost share, by the way, at the low end, you made reference there that there's no question that AUSPs are dropping in adjustables, which is probably a good thing for the business from a long-term perspective then that it means longer term, there'll be more units sold.
