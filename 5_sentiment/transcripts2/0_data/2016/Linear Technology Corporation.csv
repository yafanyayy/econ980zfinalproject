I am joined today by Bob Swanson, our Executive Chairman; and Lothar Maier, our CEO. Firstly, I would like to mention that we are hosting this call from Hong Kong, where it is 12:30 A.M. We intend to keep my opening comments brief, and hopefully, you will cut us some slack during the Q&A given the late hour. Secondly, I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answers to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timely introduction of new products and processes and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015. Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted on our press release which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the December quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance at $347.1 million, up 1.5% from the September quarter. Due to higher sales, more production days and related manufacturing efficiencies, gross margin increased from 75.1% to 75.7%. Operating income was affected by the extra week this quarter as the extra week added higher operating expenses, primarily in labor-related costs, including stock compensation and certain other operational costs increase as well. Just to clarify, fiscal 2016 is a fiscal 53-week year, and we add that week to the December quarter, making it a 14-week quarter versus the typical 13 weeks. As a result of the added expenses, operating income dropped to 43.1% of sales versus 43.8% last quarter. Net income received a benefit from the lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to 25.75% in Q1 due to the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share were $121.5 million and $0.50, of which $0.04 was due to the lower tax rate. 
For the 24th conservative year since the company began paying a dividend, the Board of Directors has once again approved a dividend increase, making the dividend $0.02 to $0.32 per share payable on February 24, 2016. Recent history shows that the December quarter is usually a down quarter for us in part due to seasonality. We are pleased that we have showed sequential growth in a difficult environment. Yes, we had an extra week [indiscernible] quarter revenue, but as I indicated last quarter, the calendar year and timing of that extra week typically does not translate into much additional revenue. That, in fact, turned out to be true. It is difficult to say exactly what that amount was due to year-end shipment patterns and the lack of full visibility of third party POS data, but we believe it was not much at all, if any, under direct OEM business, and is definitely less than 2 extra days on average I estimated might be from distribution. While I can't say for certain how much it was so I won't guess and I'll let you make your own estimate. Bookings on the other hand, are easier to quantify, and they did pick up at the end of the month. Unlike sales, we did get about 3 additional days of bookings on average from the extra week, which is more than we expected for that period. In the early part of the current quarter, bookings per day have improved over the December quarter and a positive book-to-bill ratio has given us some extra backlog heading into the March quarter. That gives us reason for optimism. As the macroeconomic picture is no better than last quarter if it is not worse, and all we have to do is read the paper and check the markets to know that. 
Naturally there's a lot of caution other among our customers. In light of all this, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the March quarter. This forecast assumes that the current run rate for bookings does not slow considerably, and that the industrial market continues to improve from the recent lull we saw in September. These are not assumptions that can be guaranteed in the current economic climate. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector, as a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com. Just click Company, Investor Relations and Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we released our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter, and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in Europe and Asia Pacific but were down in Japan. Despite the relative turmoil in the China market, it continues to be a bright spot as bookings were up the most in that geographic region on the strength of automotive. With respect to bookings by market sector, our 3 biggest markets, industrial, transportation and communications, were all up modestly led by transportation in both dollars and as a percentage. Of our smaller markets, military space was up following the weak September quarter, while computer and consumer were both down. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak, and we are certainly not alone in feeling that. 
Industrial continues to be our largest market at 43% of our bookings, the same as the previous quarter, but we did see some improvement in bookings as we hoped coming off a weak Q1. The increase in bookings was led by North America followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. Japan was essentially flat. We are encouraged by the increase as a whole, but we would not yet characterize it as a sign of strength as we're still a ways from the bookings we've had a year or so ago. So we characterized it as less weak and I think that is a good way to put it right now. March is historically a stronger industrial quarter, so this quarter should shed some better light. The overall increase in bookings was led by transportation, which increased to 23% of our business up from 22%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Europe, while North America was flat and Japan was down. Asia Pacific is showing continued strength from China due in large part to the success of our battery management products for hybrid and electric vehicles. China is currently offering significant incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric, and our BMS products have helped us capitalize on that. Korea is also a good transportation market for us as well in Asia Pacific. 
Bookings in the communications market increased as North America bookings bounced back a bit from a weak first quarter. Europe and Asia were up as well, but just slightly, and Japan was flat. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter. 
The computer market was 7% of our market, down from 9% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated previously, this market is suffering due to weaker notebook sales, and to a lesser extent, stores devices such as solid state drives. This market may continue to [indiscernible] a bit for us over in the short term as notebook sales continue to decline as expected. Longer term, we are still very much in this market and expect growth opportunities to come to fruition as we have products that address the high end of this market. 
Bookings for military, space and harsh environment products were higher this quarter, pushing its share back to 6% of our business, as has been the norm. Military bounced back from a weak first quarter, while the space business have been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to improve as satellite launch activity picks up. This is predominantly a U.S. market, though we do book some business in Europe. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market and one we don't focus on, remained at 3% of our bookings though bookings were down in the quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally, and 38% in North America versus 61% and 39% respectively last period. 
Moving on to sales, sales increased by 1.5% from the prior quarter and were down 1.5% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up in both North America and Rest of World, which is primarily Asia Pacific. Europe was essentially flat, while Japan was down. On a regional basis, North America was 27% of our business compared to 28% last quarter. Europe and Japan each remained at 19% [ph] and 15%, respectively. Asia Pacific increased from 38% of sales to 39%. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.1% to 75.7%. This is a relatively large increase on a modest sales increase, and it is unusual that cost of sales is actually less in dollars than the September quarter on higher sales volume. This results from several factors. Firstly, and obviously, the higher sales base allows us to spread factory overhead over more units sold. Secondly, gross margin in the prior quarter fell an entire point about the sharp downturn in revenue and our manufacturing plants were relatively inefficient from the quick and sudden drop in production. This turnaround to some extent during the current quarter as production stabilized. Also, despite a one week closure during the holiday week, we have 4 more production days on average, netting the shutdown days we had in each quarter. We also had an improvement in our average selling price to $0.04 to $1.92. Finally, we had some improvement due to foreign exchange, particularly, the Malaysian ringgit, lowering the cost of our foreign plants. Overall, that nets us to a very nice gross margin under the circumstances, with more than expected from the modest increase in sales. I do not expect a similar improvement in gross margin next quarter as we will lose some of those manufacturing efficiencies with our back end plants in Penang in Singapore closing for Chinese New Year, so I don't expect a decline either. 
R&D increased $3.3 million sequentially to $69.1 million, primarily due to higher labor cost and stock compensation from the one extra week in the quarter. In addition, legal costs were up slightly as were other costs such as supplies, small equipment, travel and entertainment. SG&A increased $3.2 million sequentially to $43.4 million, also due to the higher labor costs and stock compensation from 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, other costs increased primarily for advertising and travel. Due to the extra week in the quarter and the holiday period that included shutdown days for employees, this was an unusual quarter for operating expenses. So our operating expense ratio at 32.2% is unusually high. Just like revenue, it is difficult to say for sure what the extra week was were, net of the impact of the days that we shut down. As I believe you are more concerned about what the expenses would be going forward, I expect that our operating expenses with modest improvement in sales to be more in line with our first quarter in the 31% range, if not better. One thing to remember, this non-cash stock compensation is rising faster than our cash expenses as older, lower price grants best and are replaced by new higher priced grants. Recently though, it appears that the stock market is trying to take care of that difference. 
Operating income declined slightly by $0.5 million to $149.5 million, representing 43.1% of sales, again, impacted by the extra week in the quarter. And just another income increased $500,000 to $1.5 million. Interest income was up about $300,000 due to a slightly higher investment yield. Other income included a $200,000 foreign-exchange gain on certain foreign currencies held. 
Our quarterly effective income tax rate was significantly lower this quarter at 19.5% versus 25.75% last quarter entirely due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $121.5 million, up $9.5 million and was 35% of sales, up from 32.8%. 
The average year outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share increased by 232,000 shares. The weighted average stock repurchases both this period and last period was an offset increases from stock option exercises, investing of employee restricted stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.46 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $20.3 million, which includes an extra week of stock-based compensation expense, diluted EPS would have been $0.56 [ph] per share. 
Given the late hour here, I'm going to skip the balance sheet commentary. I'm sure there are many of you who are not disappointed by that. 
Looking forward, using the data points we have at this time, from our customers and sales force, and relying somewhat on history that suggests the weakened so market will continue to rebound from the seasonally lower December quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially in our third quarter. In the early part of this quarter, we are seeing recovery from certain geographies and certain customers. Also, the oversupply condition that occurred from the drop in demand 2 to 3 quarters ago have been mostly corrected. We believe in general oversupply is no longer a key issue for us for our OEM customers or in the distribution channel. We are seeing signs of life, but the macroeconomic climate is still fragile, so we're not calling the down cycle that began a few quarters ago over just yet. 
I would now like to open up the conference call to questions to be addressed by Bob, Lothar or me."

Secondly, I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answers to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timely introduction of new products and processes and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015. Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted on press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the December quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance at $347.1 million, up 1.5% from the September quarter. Due to higher sales, more production days and related manufacturing efficiencies, gross margin increased from 75.1% to 75.7%. Operating income was affected by the extra week this quarter as the extra week added higher operating expenses, primarily in labor-related costs, including stock compensations and certain other operational cost increase as well. 
Just to clarify, fiscal 2016 is a fiscal 53-week year, and we add that week to the December quarter, making it a 14-week quarter versus the typical 13 weeks. As a result of the added expenses, operating income dropped to 43.1% of sales versus 43.8% last quarter. Net income received a benefit from a lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to 25.75% in Q1 due to the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share were $121.5 million and $0.50, of which $0.04 was due to the lower tax rate. 
For the 24th conservative year since the company began paying a dividend, the Board of Directors has once again approved a dividend increase, raising the dividend $0.02 to $0.32 per share payable on February 24, 2016. Recent history shows that the December quarter is usually a down quarter for us in part due to seasonality. So we are pleased that we showed some sequential growth in a difficult economic environment. Yes, we had an extra week to record revenue, but as I indicated last quarter, the calendar year end timing of that extra week typically does not translate into much additional revenue. That, in fact, turned out to be true. 
It is difficult to say exactly what that amount was due to year-end shipment patterns and the lack of full visibility of third party POS data, but we believe it was not much at all, if any, on the direct OEM business, and it is definitely less than 2 extra days on average, I estimated it might be from distribution. While I can't say for certain how much it was so I won't guess and I'll let you make your own estimate. 
Bookings on the other hand, are easier to quantify, and they did pick up at the end of the month. Unlike sales, we did get about 3 additional days of bookings on average from the extra week, which is more than we expected for that period. In the early part of the current quarter, bookings per day have improved over the December quarter and a positive book-to-bill ratio has given us some extra backlog heading into the March quarter. That gives us reason for optimism. As the macroeconomic picture is no better than last quarter if it is not worse, and all we have to do is read the paper and check the markets to know that. 
Naturally there's a lot of caution out there among our customers. In light of all this, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the March quarter. This forecast assumes that the current run rate for bookings does not slow considerably, and that the industrial market continues to improve from the recent low we saw in the September quarter. These are not assumptions that can be guaranteed in the current economic climate. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector, as a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com. Just click Company, Investor Relations and Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in Europe and Asia Pacific but were down in Japan. Despite the relative turmoil in the China market, it continues to be a bright spot as bookings were up the most in that geographic region on the strength of automotive. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, our 3 biggest markets, industrial, transportation and communications, were all up modestly led by transportation in both dollars and as a percentage. Of our smaller markets, military space was up following the weak September quarter, while computer and consumer were both down. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak, and we are certainly not alone in feeling that. 
Industrial continues to be our largest market at 43% of our bookings, the same as the previous quarter, but we did see some improvement in bookings as we hoped coming off a weak Q1. The increase in bookings was led by North America followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. Japan was essentially flat. We are encouraged by the increase as a whole, but we would not yet characterize it as a sign of strength as we're still a ways from the bookings that we've had a year or so ago. So when characterized it as less weak, and I think that is a good way to put it right now. 
March is historically a stronger industrial quarter, so this quarter should shed some better light. The overall increase in bookings was led by transportation, which increased to 23% of our business up from 22%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Europe, while North America was flat and Japan was down. Asia Pacific is showing continued strength from China due in large part to the success of our battery management products for hybrid and electric vehicles. China is currently offering significant incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric, and our BMS products have helped us capitalize on that. Korea is also a good transportation market for us as well in Asia Pacific. 
Bookings in the communications market increased as North America bookings bounced back a bit from a weak first quarter. Europe and Asia were up as well, but just slightly, and Japan was flat. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter. 
The computer market was 7% of our bookings, down from 9% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated previously, this market is suffering due to weaker notebook sales, and to a lesser extent, stores devices such as solid state drives. This market may continue to [indiscernible] a bit for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline as expected. Longer term, we are still very much in this market and expect growth opportunities to come to fruition as we have products that address the high end of this market. 
Bookings for military, space and harsh environment products were higher this quarter, pushing its share back to 6% of our business as has been the norm. Military bounced back from a weak first quarter, while the space business has been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to improve as satellite launch activity picks up. This is predominantly a U.S. market, though we do book some business in Europe. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market and one we don't focus on, remained at 3% of our bookings though bookings were down in the quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally, and 38% in North America versus 61% and 39% respectively last period. 
Moving on to sales, sales increased by 1.5% from the prior quarter and were down 1.5% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up in both North America and rest of world, which is primarily Asia Pacific. Europe was essentially flat, while Japan was down. On a regional basis, North America was 27% of our business compared to 28% last quarter. Europe and Japan each remained at 19% and 15%, respectively. Asia Pacific increased from 38% of sales to 39%. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.1% to 75.7%. This is a relatively large increase on a modest sales increase. And it is unusual that cost of sales is actually less in dollars than the September quarter on higher sales volume. This results from several factors. Firstly, and obviously, the higher sales base allows us to spread factory overhead over more units sold. Secondly, gross margin in the prior quarter fell an entire point after the sharp downturn in revenue and our manufacturing plants were relatively inefficient from the quick and sudden drop in production. This turned around to some extent during the current quarter as production stabilized. Also, despite a 1 week closure during the holiday week, we have 4 more production days on average, netting the shutdown days we had in each quarter. We also had an improvement in our average selling price of $0.04 to $1.92. Finally, we had some improvement due to foreign exchange, particularly, the Malaysian ringgit, lowering the cost of our foreign plants. Overall, that nets us to a very nice gross margin under the circumstances, which is more than expected from the modest increase in sales. I do not expect a similar improvement in gross margin next quarter as we will lose some of those manufacturing efficiencies with our back end plants in Penang in Singapore closing for Chinese New Year, so I don't expect a decline either. 
R&D increased $3.3 million sequentially to $69.9 million, primarily due to higher labor cost and stock compensation from the 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, legal costs were up slightly as were other costs such as supplies, small equipment, travel and entertainment. 
SG&A increased $3.2 million sequentially to $43.4 million, also due to the higher labor cost and stock compensation from 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, other costs increased primarily for advertising and travel. Due to the extra week in the quarter and the holiday period that included shutdown days for all Linear employees, this was an unusual quarter for operating expenses. So our operating expense ratio at 32.2% is unusually high. Just like revenue, it is difficult to say for sure what the extra week was worth, net of the impact of the days that we shut down. And I believe you are more concerned about what the expenses will be going forward, I expect that our operating expenses with modest improvement in sales to be more in line with our first quarter in the 31% range, if not better. One thing to remember, this non-cash stock compensation is rising faster than our cash expenses as older, lower price grants best and are replaced by new higher priced grants. Recently though, it appears that the stock market is trying to take care of that difference. 
Operating income declined slightly by $0.5 million to $149.5 million, representing 43.1% of sales, again, impacted by the extra week in the quarter. Interest and another income increased $500,000 to $1.5 million. Interest income was up about $300,000 due to a slightly higher investment yield. Other income included a $200,000 foreign exchange gain on certain foreign currencies held. 
Our quarterly effective income tax rate was significantly lower this quarter at 19.5% versus 25.75% last quarter entirely due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $121.5 million, up $9.5 million, and with 35% of sales up from 32.8%. 
The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share increased by 272,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset increases from stock option exercises and vesting of employee restricted stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.46 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $20.3 million, which includes an extra week of stock-based compensation expense, diluted EPS would have been $0.56 per share. 
Given the late hour here, I'm going to skip the balance sheet commentary. I'm sure there are many of you who are not disappointed by that. 
Looking forward, using the data points we have at this time, from our customers and sales force, and relying somewhat on history that suggest the weak industrial market will continue to rebound from the seasonally lower December quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially in our third quarter. In the early part of this quarter, we are seeing recovery from certain geographies and certain customers. Also, the oversupply condition that occurred from the drop in demand 2 to 3 quarters ago has been mostly corrected. We believe, in general, oversupply is no longer a key issue for our OEM customers or in the distribution channel. We are seeing signs of life, but the macroeconomic climate is still fragile, so we're not calling to down cycle that began a few quarters ago over just yet. 
I would now like to open up the conference call to questions to be addressed by Bob, Lothar or me."

That is starting to evolve and it's -- as more car OEMs field electric and hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars, even those today, the quantity of those cars are still relatively small, the content of opportunities for Linear are significantly higher, multiple tire in those types of cars. So the hybrid and electric vehicle market is a very interesting market for us because it has a much, much higher electronic content for us. So that's where we're seeing some pretty significant opportunities. But there's the sort of waves of new areas for electronics that are coming in the cars. I mentioned earlier, the 48-volt battery system, that's going to have a wave of opportunities. ADAS systems is going to have a wave of opportunities. And we're just seeing these waves of opportunities coming in, and I think there's just a lot of good opportunities for vehicles right now and we've seen the benefit of it in the last several years where we've seen pretty steady growth in our automotive sales and also in the percentage of our sales going into the automotive market. So I hope that answered part of your question."

I am joined today by Bob Swanson, our Executive Chairman; and Lothar Maier, our CEO. Firstly, I would like to mention that we are hosting this call from Hong Kong, where it is 12:30 A.M. So I intend to keep my opening comments brief, and hopefully, you will cut us some slack during the Q&A given the late hour. Secondly, I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answers to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timely introduction of new products and processes; and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015. Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted on our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the December quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance at $347.1 million, up 1.5% from the September quarter. Due to higher sales, more production days and related manufacturing efficiencies, gross margin increased from 75.1% to 75.7%. Operating income was affected by the extra week this quarter as the extra week added higher operating expenses, primarily in labor-related costs, including stock compensations, though certain other operational cost increase as well. 
Just to clarify, fiscal 2016 is a fiscal 53-week year, and we add that week to the December quarter, making it a 14-week quarter versus the typical 13 weeks. As a result of the added expenses, operating income dropped to 43.1% of sales versus 43.8% last quarter. Net income received a benefit from a lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to 25.75% in Q1 due to the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share were $121.5 million and $0.50, of which $0.04 was due to the lower tax rate. 
For the 24th conservative year since the company began paying a dividend, the Board of Directors has once again approved a dividend increase, raising the dividend $0.02 to $0.32 per share payable on February 24, 2016. Recent history shows that the December quarter is usually a down quarter for us, in part due to seasonality. So we are pleased that we showed some sequential growth in a difficult economic environment. Yes, we had an extra week to record revenue, but as I indicated last quarter, the calendar year-end timing of that extra week typically does not translate into much additional revenue. That, in fact, turned out to be true. 
It is difficult to say exactly what that amount was due to year-end shipment patterns and the lack of full visibility of third party POS data, but we believe it was not much at all, if any, on the direct OEM business, and it is definitely less than 2 extra days on average, I estimated it might be, from distribution. While I can't say for certain how much it was so I won't guess and I'll let you make your own estimate. 
Bookings on the other hand are easier to quantify, and they did pick up at the end of the month. Unlike sales, we did get about 3 additional days of bookings on average from the extra week, which is more than we expected for that period. In the early part of the current quarter, bookings per day have improved over the December quarter and a positive book-to-bill ratio has given us some extra backlog heading into the March quarter. That gives us reason for optimism, as the macroeconomic picture is no better than last quarter, if it is not worse, and all we have to do is read the paper and check the markets to know that. 
Naturally there's a lot of caution out there among our customers. In light of all this, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the March quarter. This forecast assumes that the current run rate for bookings does not slow considerably, and that the industrial market continues to improve from the recent low we saw in the September quarter. These are not assumptions that can be guaranteed in the current economic climate. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector. As a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com. Just click Company, Investor Relations and Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in Europe and Asia Pacific but were down in Japan. Despite the relative turmoil in the China market, it continues to be a bright spot as bookings were up the most in that geographic region on the strength of automotive. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, our 3 biggest markets -- industrial, transportation and communications -- were all up modestly led by transportation in both dollars and as a percentage. Of our smaller markets, military, space was up following the weak September quarter, while computer and consumer were both down. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak, and we are certainly not alone in feeling that. 
Industrial continues to be our largest market at 43% of our bookings, the same as the previous quarter, but we did see some improvement in bookings as we hoped coming off a weak Q1. The increase in bookings was led by North America followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. Japan was essentially flat. We are encouraged by the increase as a whole, but we would not yet characterize it as a sign of strength as we are still a ways from the bookings level we had a year or so ago. Someone characterized it as less weak, and I think that is a good way to put it right now. 
March is historically a stronger industrial quarter, so this quarter should shed some better light. The overall increase in bookings was led by transportation, which increased to 23% of our business, up from 22%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Europe, while North America was flat and Japan was down. Asia Pacific is showing continued strength from China due in large part to the success of our battery management products for hybrid and electric vehicles. China is currently offering significant incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric, and our BMS products have helped us capitalize on that. Korea is also a good transportation market for us as well in Asia Pacific. 
Bookings in the communications market increased as North America bookings bounced back a bit from a weak first quarter. Europe and Asia were up as well, but just slightly, and Japan was flat. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter. 
The computer market was 7% of our bookings, down from 9% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated previously, this market is suffering due to weaker notebook sales, and to a lesser extent, storage devices such as solid state drives. This market may continue to atrophy a bit for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline as expected. Longer term, we are still very much in this market and expect growth opportunity to come to fruition as we have products that address the high end of this market. 
Bookings for military, space and harsh environment products were higher this quarter, pushing its share back to 6% of our business as has been the norm. Military bounced back from a weak first quarter, while the space business has been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to improve as satellite launch activity picks up. This is predominantly a U.S. market, though we do book some business in Europe. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market and one we don't focus on, remained at 3% of our bookings though bookings were down in the quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally, and 38% in North America versus 61% and 39% respectively last period. 
Moving on to sales. Sales increased by 1.5% from the prior quarter and were down 1.5% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up in both North America and rest of world, which is primarily Asia Pacific. Europe was essentially flat, while Japan was down. On a regional basis, North America was 27% of our business compared to 28% last quarter. Europe and Japan each remained at 19% and 15%, respectively. Asia Pacific increased from 38% of sales to 39%. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.1% to 75.7%. This is a relatively-large increase on a modest sales increase. And it is unusual that cost of sales is actually less in dollars than the September quarter on higher sales volume. This results from several factors. Firstly, and obviously, the higher sales base allows us to spread factory overhead over more units sold. Secondly, gross margin in the prior quarter fell an entire point after the sharp downturn in revenue and our manufacturing plants were relatively inefficient from the quick and sudden drop in production. This turned around to some extent during the current quarter as production stabilized. Also, despite a 1 week closure during the holiday week, we had 4 more production days on average, netting the shutdown days we had in each quarter. We also had an improvement in our average selling price of $0.04 to $1.92. Finally, we had some improvement due to foreign exchange, particularly, the Malaysian ringgit, lowering the cost of our foreign plants. Overall, that nets off to a very nice gross margin under the circumstances, which is more than expected from the modest increase in sales. I do not expect a similar improvement in gross margin next quarter as we will lose some of those manufacturing efficiencies with our back-end plants in Penang and Singapore closing for Chinese New Year, though I don't expect a decline either. 
R&D increased $3.3 million sequentially to $69.9 million, primarily due to higher labor cost and stock compensation from the 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, legal costs were up slightly as were other costs such as supplies, small equipment, travel and entertainment. 
SG&A increased $3.2 million sequentially to $43.4 million, also due to the higher labor cost and stock compensation from 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, other costs increased primarily for advertising and travel. Due to the extra week in the quarter and the holiday period that included shutdown days for all Linear employees, this was an unusual quarter for operating expenses. So our operating expense ratio at 32.2% is unusually high. Just like revenue, it is difficult to say for sure what the extra week was worth, net of the impact of the days that we shut down. As I believe you are more concerned about what the expenses will be going forward, I expect that our operating expenses with modest improvement in sales to be more in line with our first quarter in the 31% range, if not better. One thing to remember, is non-cash stock compensation is rising faster than our cash expenses as older, lower priced grants best [ph] and are replaced by new higher-priced grants [ph] . Recently though, it appears that the stock market is trying to take care of that difference. 
Operating income declined slightly by $0.5 million to $149.5 million, representing 43.1% of sales, again, impacted by the extra week in the quarter. Interest and another income increased from $500k to $1.5 million. Interest income was up about $300k due to a slightly higher investment yield. Other income included a $200k foreign exchange gain on certain foreign currencies held. 
Our quarterly effective income tax rate was significantly lower this quarter at 19.5% versus 25.75% last quarter entirely due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $121.5 million, up $9.5 million, and with 35% of sales up from 32.8%. 
The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share increased by 272,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset increases from stock option exercises and vesting of employee-restricted stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.46 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $20.3 million, which includes an extra week of stock-based compensation expense, diluted EPS would have been $0.56 per share. 
Given the late hour here, I'm going to skip the balance sheet commentary. I'm sure there are many of you who are not disappointed by that. 
Looking forward. Using the data points we have at this time, from our customers and sales force, and relying somewhat on history that suggests the weak industrial market will continue to rebound from the seasonally lower December quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially in our third quarter. In the early part of this quarter, we are seeing recovery from certain geographies and certain customers. Also, the oversupply condition that occurred from the drop in demand 2 to 3 quarters ago has been mostly corrected. We believe, in general, oversupply is no longer a key issue for our OEM customers or in the distribution channel. We are seeing signs of life, but the macroeconomic climate is still fragile, so we're not calling the down cycle that began a few quarters ago, over just yet. 
I would now like to open up the conference call to questions to be addressed by Bob, Lothar or me."

Hopefully we'll get some improvement but it's too early to know. Just like you said, there's just a lot of moving pieces."

So I intend to keep my opening comments brief, and hopefully, you will cut us some slack during the Q&A given the late hour. Secondly, I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answers to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timely introduction of new products and processes; and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015. Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted on our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the December quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance at $347.1 million, up 1.5% from the September quarter. Due to higher sales, more production days and related manufacturing efficiencies, gross margin increased from 75.1% to 75.7%. Operating income was affected by the extra week this quarter as the extra week added higher operating expenses, primarily in labor-related costs, including stock compensations, though certain other operational cost increased as well. 
Just to clarify, fiscal 2016 is a fiscal 53-week year, and we add that week to the December quarter, making it a 14-week quarter versus the typical 13 weeks. As a result of the added expenses, operating income dropped to 43.1% of sales versus 43.8% last quarter. Net income received a benefit from a lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to 25.75% in Q1 due to the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share were $121.5 million and $0.50, of which $0.04 was due to the lower tax rate. 
For the 24th consecutive year since the company began paying a dividend, the Board of Directors has once again approved a dividend increase, raising the dividend $0.02 to $0.32 per share payable on February 24, 2016. Recent history shows that the December quarter is usually a down quarter for us, in part due to seasonality. So we are pleased that we showed some sequential growth in a difficult economic environment. Yes, we had an extra week to record revenue, but as I indicated last quarter, the calendar year-end  timing of that extra week typically does not translate into much additional revenue. That, in fact, turned out to be true. 
It is difficult to say exactly what that amount was due to year-end shipment patterns and the lack of full visibility of third party POS data, but we believe it was not much at all, if any, on the direct OEM business, and it is definitely less than 2 extra days on average, I estimated it might be, from distribution. While I can't say for certain how much it was so I won't guess and I'll let you make your own estimate. 
Bookings on the other hand are easier to quantify, and they did pick up at the end of the month. Unlike sales, we did get about 3 additional days of bookings on average from the extra week, which is more than we expected for that period. In the early part of the current quarter, bookings per day have improved over the December quarter and a positive book-to-bill ratio has given us some extra backlog heading into the March quarter. That gives us reason for optimism, as the macroeconomic picture is no better than last quarter, if it is not worse, and all you have to do is read the paper and check the markets to know that. 
Naturally there's a lot of caution out there among our customers. In light of all this, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the March quarter. This forecast assumes that the current run rate for bookings does not slow considerably, and that the industrial market continues to improve from the recent low we saw in the September quarter. These are not assumptions that can be guaranteed in the current economic climate. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector. As a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com. Just click Company, Investor Relations and Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in Europe and Asia Pacific but were down in Japan. Despite the relative turmoil in the China market, it continues to be a bright spot as bookings were up the most in that geographic region on the strength of automotive. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, our 3 biggest markets: industrial, transportation and communications, were all up modestly led by transportation in both dollars and as a percentage. Of our smaller markets, military space was up following the weak September quarter, while computer and consumer were both down. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak, and we are certainly not alone in feeling that. 
Industrial continues to be our largest market at 43% of our bookings, the same as the previous quarter, but we did see some improvement in bookings as we hoped coming off a weak Q1. The increase in bookings was led by North America, followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. Japan was essentially flat. We are encouraged by the increase as a whole, but we would not yet characterize it as a sign of strength as we are still a ways from the bookings level we had a year or so ago. Someone  characterized it as less weak, and I think that is a good way to put it right now. 
March is historically a stronger industrial quarter, so this quarter should shed some better light. The overall increase in bookings was led by transportation, which increased to 23% of our business, up from 22%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Europe, while North America was flat and Japan was down. Asia Pacific is showing continued strength from China due in large part to the success of our battery management products for hybrid and electric vehicles. China is currently offering significant incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric, and our BMS products have helped us capitalize on that. Korea is also a good transportation market for us as well in Asia Pacific. 
Bookings in the communications market increased as North America bookings bounced back a bit from a weak first quarter. Europe and Asia were up as well, but just slightly, and Japan was flat. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter. 
The computer market was 7% of our bookings, down from 9% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated previously, this market is suffering due to weaker notebook sales, and to a lesser extent, storage devices such as solid state drives. This market may continue to atrophy a bit for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline as expected. Longer term, we are still very much in this market and expect growth opportunity to come to fruition as we have products that address the high end of this market. 
Bookings for military, space and harsh environment products were higher this quarter, pushing its share back to 6% of our business as has been the norm. Military bounced back from a weak first quarter, while the space business has been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to improve as satellite launch activity picks up. This is predominantly a U.S. market, though we do book some business in Europe. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market and one we don't focus on, remained at 3% of our bookings though bookings were down in the quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally, and 38% in North America versus 61% and 39% respectively last period. 
Moving on to sales. Sales increased by 1.5% from the prior quarter and were down 1.5% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up in both North America and rest of world, which is primarily Asia Pacific. Europe was essentially flat, while Japan was down. On a regional basis, North America was 27% of our business compared to 28% last quarter. Europe and Japan each remained at 19% and 15%, respectively. Asia Pacific increased from 38% of sales to 39%. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.1% to 75.7%. This is a relatively-large  increase on a modest sales increase. And it is unusual that cost of sales is actually less in dollars than the September quarter on higher sales volume. This results from several factors. Firstly, and obviously, the higher sales base allows us to spread factory overhead over more units sold. Secondly, gross margin in the prior quarter fell an entire point after the sharp downturn in revenue and our manufacturing plants were relatively inefficient from the quick and sudden drop in production. This turned around to some extent during the current quarter as production stabilized. Also, despite a 1 week closure during the holiday week, we had 4 more production days on average, netting the shutdown days we had in each quarter. We also had an improvement in our average selling price of $0.04 to $1.92. Finally, we had some improvement due to foreign exchange, particularly the Malaysian ringgit, lowering the cost of our foreign plants. Overall, that nets off to a very nice gross margin under the circumstances, which is more than expected from the modest increase in sales. I do not expect a similar improvement in gross margin next quarter as we will lose some of those manufacturing efficiencies with our back-end  plants in Penang and Singapore closing for Chinese New Year, though I don't expect a decline either. 
R&D increased $3.3 million sequentially to $69.9 million, primarily due to higher labor cost and stock compensation from the 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, legal costs were up slightly as were other costs such as supplies, small equipment, travel and entertainment. 
SG&A increased $3.2 million sequentially to $43.4 million, also due to the higher labor cost and stock compensation from 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, other costs increased primarily for advertising and travel. Due to the extra week in the quarter and the holiday period that included shutdown days for all Linear employees, this was an unusual quarter for operating expenses. So our operating expense ratio at 32.2% is unusually high. Just like revenue, it is difficult to say for sure what the extra week was worth, net of the impact of the days that we shut down. 
Since I believe you are more concerned about what the expenses will be going forward, I expect that our operating expenses with modest improvement in sales to be more in line with our first quarter in the 31% range, if not better. One thing to remember is noncash stock compensation is rising faster than our cash expenses as older, lower-priced grants vest and are replaced by new higher-priced grants. Recently though, it appears that the stock market is trying to take care of that difference. 
Operating income declined slightly by $0.5 million to $149.5 million, representing 43.1% of sales, again impacted by the extra week in the quarter. Interest and another income increased from 500k to $1.5 million. Interest income was up about 300k due to a slightly higher investment yield. Other income included a 200k foreign exchange gain on certain foreign currencies held. 
Our quarterly effective income tax rate was significantly lower this quarter at 19.5% versus 25.75% last quarter entirely due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $121.5 million, up $9.5 million, and was 35% of sales up from 32.8%. 
The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share increased by 272,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset increases from stock option exercises and vesting of employee-restricted  stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.46 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $20.3 million, which includes an extra week of stock-based compensation expense, diluted EPS would have been $0.56 per share. 
Given the late hour here, I'm going to skip the balance sheet commentary. I'm sure there are many of you who are not disappointed by that. 
Looking forward. Using the data points we have at this time, from our customers and sales force, and relying somewhat on history that suggests the weak industrial market will continue to rebound from the seasonally lower December quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially in our third quarter. In the early part of this quarter, we are seeing recovery from certain geographies and certain customers. Also, the oversupply condition that occurred from the drop in demand 2 to 3 quarters ago has been mostly corrected. We believe in general, oversupply is no longer a key issue for our OEM customers or in the distribution channel. We are seeing signs of life, but the macroeconomic climate is still fragile so we're not calling the down cycle that began a few quarters ago over just yet. 
I would now like to open up the conference call to questions to be addressed by Bob, Lothar or me."

Is it the big Arrow, Avnets out there? Or is it local Chinese guys where you've seen the change?"

So that's where we're seeing some pretty significant opportunities. But there's sort of waves of new areas for electronics that are coming into  cars. I mentioned earlier, the 48-volt battery system, that's going to have a wave of opportunities. ADAS systems is going to have a wave of opportunities. And we're just seeing these waves of opportunities coming in, and I think there's just a lot of good opportunities for vehicles right now and we've seen the benefit of it in the last several years where we've seen pretty steady growth in our automotive sales and also in the percentage of our sales that go into the automotive market.

So I intend to keep my opening comments brief, and hopefully, you will cut us some slack during the Q&A given the late hour. Secondly, I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answers to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timely introduction of new products and processes; and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015. Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted on our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the December quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance at $347.1 million, up 1.5% from the September quarter. Due to higher sales, more production days and related manufacturing efficiencies, gross margin increased from 75.1% to 75.7%. Operating income was affected by the extra week this quarter as the extra week added higher operating expenses, primarily in labor-related costs, including stock compensations, though certain other operational cost increased as well. 
Just to clarify, fiscal 2016 is a fiscal 53-week year, and we add that week to the December quarter, making it a 14-week quarter versus the typical 13 weeks. As a result of the added expenses, operating income dropped to 43.1% of sales versus 43.8% last quarter. Net income received a benefit from a lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to 25.75% in Q1 due to the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net income and earnings per share were $121.5 million and $0.50, of which $0.04 was due to the lower tax rate. 
For the 24th consecutive year since the company began paying a dividend, the Board of Directors has once again approved a dividend increase, raising the dividend $0.02 to $0.32 per share payable on February 24, 2016. Recent history shows that the December quarter is usually a down quarter for us, in part due to seasonality. So we are pleased that we showed some sequential growth in a difficult economic environment. Yes, we had an extra week to record revenue, but as I indicated last quarter, the calendar year-end  timing of that extra week typically does not translate into much additional revenue. That, in fact, turned out to be true. 
It is difficult to say exactly what that amount was due to year-end shipment patterns and the lack of full visibility of third party POS data, but we believe it was not much at all, if any, on the direct OEM business, and it is definitely less than 2 extra days on average, I estimated it might be, from distribution. While I can't say for certain how much it was so I won't guess and I'll let you make your own estimate. 
Bookings on the other hand are easier to quantify, and they did pick up at the end of the month. Unlike sales, we did get about 3 additional days of bookings on average from the extra week, which is more than we expected for that period. In the early part of the current quarter, bookings per day have improved over the December quarter and a positive book-to-bill ratio has given us some extra backlog heading into the March quarter. That gives us reason for optimism, as the macroeconomic picture is no better than last quarter, if it is not worse, and all you have to do is read the paper and check the markets to know that. 
Naturally there's a lot of caution out there among our customers. In light of all this, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the March quarter. This forecast assumes that the current run rate for bookings does not slow considerably, and that the industrial market continues to improve from the recent low we saw in the September quarter. These are not assumptions that can be guaranteed in the current economic climate. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector. As a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com. Just click Company, Investor Relations and Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in Europe and Asia Pacific but were down in Japan. Despite the relative turmoil in the China market, it continues to be a bright spot as bookings were up the most in that geographic region on the strength of automotive. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, our 3 biggest markets: industrial, transportation and communications, were all up modestly led by transportation in both dollars and as a percentage. Of our smaller markets, military space was up following the weak September quarter, while computer and consumer were both down. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak, and we are certainly not alone in feeling that. 
Industrial continues to be our largest market at 43% of our bookings, the same as the previous quarter, but we did see some improvement in bookings as we hoped coming off a weak Q1. The increase in bookings was led by North America, followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. Japan was essentially flat. We are encouraged by the increase as a whole, but we would not yet characterize it as a sign of strength as we are still a ways from the bookings level we had a year or so ago. Someone  characterized it as less weak, and I think that is a good way to put it right now. 
March is historically a stronger industrial quarter, so this quarter should shed some better light. The overall increase in bookings was led by transportation, which increased to 23% of our business, up from 22%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Europe, while North America was flat and Japan was down. Asia Pacific is showing continued strength from China due in large part to the success of our battery management products for hybrid and electric vehicles. China is currently offering significant incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric, and our BMS products have helped us capitalize on that. Korea is also a good transportation market for us as well in Asia Pacific. 
Bookings in the communications market increased as North America bookings bounced back a bit from a weak first quarter. Europe and Asia were up as well, but just slightly, and Japan was flat. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter. 
The computer market was 7% of our bookings, down from 9% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated previously, this market is suffering due to weaker notebook sales, and to a lesser extent, storage devices such as solid state drives. This market may continue to atrophy a bit for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline as expected. Longer term, we are still very much in this market and expect growth opportunity to come to fruition as we have products that address the high end of this market. 
Bookings for military, space and harsh environment products were higher this quarter, pushing its share back to 6% of our business as has been the norm. Military bounced back from a weak first quarter, while the space business has been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to improve as satellite launch activity picks up. This is predominantly a U.S. market, though we do book some business in Europe. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market and one we don't focus on, remained at 3% of our bookings though bookings were down in the quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally, and 38% in North America versus 61% and 39% respectively last period. 
Moving on to sales. Sales increased by 1.5% from the prior quarter and were down 1.5% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up in both North America and rest of world, which is primarily Asia Pacific. Europe was essentially flat, while Japan was down. On a regional basis, North America was 27% of our business compared to 28% last quarter. Europe and Japan each remained at 19% and 15%, respectively. Asia Pacific increased from 38% of sales to 39%. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.1% to 75.7%. This is a relatively large increase on a modest sales increase. And it is unusual that cost of sales is actually less in dollars than the September quarter on higher sales volume. This results from several factors. Firstly, and obviously, the higher sales base allows us to spread factory overhead over more units sold. Secondly, gross margin in the prior quarter fell an entire point after the sharp downturn in revenue and our manufacturing plants were relatively inefficient from the quick and sudden drop in production. This turned around to some extent during the current quarter as production stabilized. Also, despite a 1 week closure during the holiday week, we had 4 more production days on average, netting the shutdown days we had in each quarter. We also had an improvement in our average selling price of $0.04 to $1.92. Finally, we had some improvement due to foreign exchange, particularly the Malaysian ringgit, lowering the cost of our foreign plants. Overall, that nets off to a very nice gross margin under the circumstances, which is more than expected from the modest increase in sales. I do not expect a similar improvement in gross margin next quarter as we will lose some of those manufacturing efficiencies with our back-end  plants in Penang and Singapore closing for Chinese New Year, though I don't expect a decline either. 
R&D increased $3.3 million sequentially to $69.9 million, primarily due to higher labor cost and stock compensation from the 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, legal costs were up slightly as were other costs such as supplies, small equipment, travel and entertainment. 
SG&A increased $3.2 million sequentially to $43.4 million, also due to the higher labor cost and stock compensation from 1 extra week in the quarter. In addition, other costs increased primarily for advertising and travel. Due to the extra week in the quarter and the holiday period that included shutdown days for all Linear employees, this was an unusual quarter for operating expenses. So our operating expense ratio at 32.2% is unusually high. Just like revenue, it is difficult to say for sure what the extra week was worth, net of the impact of the days that we shut down. 
Since I believe you are more concerned about what the expenses will be going forward, I expect that our operating expenses with modest improvement in sales to be more in line with our first quarter in the 31% range, if not better. One thing to remember is noncash stock compensation is rising faster than our cash expenses as older, lower-priced grants vest and are replaced by new higher-priced grants. Recently though, it appears that the stock market is trying to take care of that difference. 
Operating income declined slightly by $0.5 million to $149.5 million, representing 43.1% of sales, again impacted by the extra week in the quarter. Interest and another income increased from 500k to $1.5 million. Interest income was up about 300k due to a slightly higher investment yield. Other income included a 200k foreign exchange gain on certain foreign currencies held. 
Our quarterly effective income tax rate was significantly lower this quarter at 19.5% versus 25.75% last quarter entirely due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $121.5 million, up $9.5 million, and was 35% of sales up from 32.8%. 
The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share increased by 272,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset increases from stock option exercises and vesting of employee-restricted  stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.46 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $20.3 million, which includes an extra week of stock-based compensation expense, diluted EPS would have been $0.56 per share. 
Given the late hour here, I'm going to skip the balance sheet commentary. I'm sure there are many of you who are not disappointed by that. 
Looking forward. Using the data points we have at this time, from our customers and sales force, and relying somewhat on history that suggests the weak industrial market will continue to rebound from the seasonally lower December quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially in our third quarter. In the early part of this quarter, we are seeing recovery from certain geographies and certain customers. Also, the oversupply condition that occurred from the drop in demand 2 to 3 quarters ago has been mostly corrected. We believe in general, oversupply is no longer a key issue for our OEM customers or in the distribution channel. We are seeing signs of life, but the macroeconomic climate is still fragile so we're not calling the down cycle that began a few quarters ago over just yet. 
I would now like to open up the conference call to questions to be addressed by Bob, Lothar or me."

So I think we're seeing some growth here, partially because of seasonality. But I think, at least as  important is the fact that our products and our sales efforts and our design efforts are in the markets that seem to be doing relatively well. I say this all the time, and it surprises people, is the -- if you look at the total analog market, the industrial and the automotives make up 50% of the total analog market. Not us, but the total analog market. And we -- that's where the majority of our business is directed towards.

I'm joined today by Bob Swanson, our Executive Chairman; and Lothar Maier, our CEO. I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answer to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timing of introduction of new products and processes; and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015 and our subsequent quarterly filings on Form 10-Q. Also SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted in our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the March quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance at $361.1 million, up 4% from the December quarter. Gross margin increased to 76.2% from 75.7%, benefiting from the higher sales base of full quarter production in our fabs and certain other manufacturing efficiencies. Recall that our second quarter have less production days in our fabs due to holidays and plant shutdown days. Operating margin improved to 45% of sales up from 43.1% due to the higher gross margin and 1 less week of operating expenses as we had 14 weeks in our second quarter. Our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the third quarter at 21.75% versus 19.5% in Q2 on lower discrete quarterly items. Net income and earnings per share were $128.4 million and $0.52 per share. All told, this was a pretty good quarter and we are happy with the results given global macroeconomic that are still providing some headwinds. We beat the midpoint of our guidance, we increased gross margin and operating margin and our bookings increased over the prior quarter at a level that should allow us to grow in the fourth quarter as well. The transportation market continues to grow nicely, and we are seeing recovery in the industrial market and to a lesser extent, the communications market, which has been weak for some time. We are seeing recovery across the broad-based including the distribution and the smaller and midsized customers. In general, inventories in the channel appear to be imbalanced and we believe we are shipping to end customer demand. However, there remains pockets of weaknesses in certain geographies, and the computer market remains particularly weak, though that is not a major market for us. We remain cautious given the general business climate, but based upon our third quarter bookings and our current run rate, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector, as a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com under Investor Relations Supplemental Information. We posted this information by the end of our business day on the day we released our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased to both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in each of our major geographic regions, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. We continue to do particularly well in China, as bookings were up the most in that region on the strength of automotive, though our industrial business is growing in that country too. With respect to bookings by market sector, bookings were up in each of our major markets that represent 86% of our business, industrial, transportation and communications, and our smaller markets, military space grew modestly, while computer and consumer showed declines. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak. Industrial continues to be our largest market at 44% of our bookings, up from 43% the previous quarter. Industrial bookings increased in each of our major geographic regions led by North America and Europe. The breadth of this increase across our customer base is giving us some comfort that the noticeable weakness we experienced in this market over the past several months is in recovery, and that the inventory correction that resulted is behind us. We believe we are shipping to end customer demand, and the inventories in the channel and at the OEMs are at least stable, if not lean. 
Turning to transportation bookings, this market continues to show the highest percentage growth and it was 24% of our businesses that quarter, up from 23%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia Pacific, but we saw growth in Japan and the U.S. as well. The U.S. has been a smaller transportation market for us, but we are making good strides here, and is up nicely for the quarter in percentage terms and opportunities to continues to increase. Europe bookings were down in transportation modestly in the quarter but coming off a relatively strong Q2. Transportation growth in Asia Pacific continues to be strong, and it was the highest region in total transportation bookings, overtaking both Europe and Japan for the first time. As you should know by now, we have been particularly successful with our parts in the China and Korea market. As I have noticed on previous calls, China is all-in on electric vehicles as one part of the solution for the severe air pollution, offering incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric vehicles, including autos, taxis and buses. Our superior BMS parts have won a significant business in China where we enjoy very high market share for battery management systems. Our transportation business in this region should continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable feature. 
Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter, but after 2 quarters of sequential growth, we are hopeful that this market is beginning to show some life. The large base stations and infrastructure piece of this market continues to be weak, but that is no longer a sizable piece of our communications business. We are seeing growth in optical, networking and datacom, which is the area of the market that we focus. This market was strongest for us in the U.S., while Europe was flat and Asia was down slightly. The computer market was 6% of our bookings, down from 7% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America where the majority of this business is booked. As stated last quarter, this market is down as expected, as it is suffering due to weaker notebook sales and storage devices. This market may continue to decline a bit more for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline. But longer term, we expect growth opportunities as we have compelling products in development that address the higher end of this market where innovation and superior functionality are still needed. 
Bookings for military space and harsh environment products increased modestly this quarter and remained at 6% of our business. Military has rebounded slowly from the weakness we experienced in the first quarter, while the space business have been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to pick up as satellite launch activity increases. This is predominantly a U.S. market, but we do book some business in Europe. Both regions saw an increase in bookings this quarter. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market where we take business opportunistically when functionality and performance still matter, this market decreased to 2% of our business down from 3% last quarter. With regard to our bookings are actually created, 62% [ph] were created internationally, and 38% in North America, the same as last period. 
Moving to sales, sales increased by 4% from the prior quarter and were down 2.9% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up the most in Europe followed by North America and Asia Pacific, but were down in Japan, which is not unusual as March is typically their fiscal year end. U.S. sales were up for both OEM and distribution where revenue is recognized on sellthrough basis. On a regional basis, North America was 28% of our business, up from 27% last quarter. Europe was up to 21% this quarter from 19% last quarter. Japan declined to 13% of our business down from 15% last quarter and Asia Pacific decreased from 39% to 38% of sales but was up in absolute dollars. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.7% to 76.2%. This is a good result particularly since our overseas assembly and test operations have lowered production days due to Chinese New Year. Gross margin was aided by the higher sales base, which reduces fixed overhead per units and an increase in our average selling price to $1.97, up $0.05 from $1.92 last quarter. The fourth quarter is a full production quarter for all of our plants, and we expect to grow sales. So I do expect some margin expansion subject to the product mix within sales. 
R&D decreased $0.2 million sequentially to $62.6 million primarily due to lower labor and fringe cost as there was 1 extra week in the prior quarter. In addition, legal costs were down. Partially offsetting these decreases, vacation cost and profit-sharing increased. Vacation costs were higher as there were no shutdown days and much less vacation taken in the third quarter than during the holiday season. 
SG&A decreased $0.4 million sequentially to $43 million. Similar to R&D, this was mostly due to lower labor and fringe cost from 1 less week in the quarter compared to Q2. In addition, other cost decrease such as advertising, travel and foreign sales cost from foreign exchange. Similar to R&D, these declines were partially offset by higher vacation costs and profit-sharing. 
Operating income increased by $13 million to $162.5 million, representing 45% of our sales. Interest and other income increased slightly to $1.6 million on higher invested cash, net of small loss from foreign currency transactions. Our quarterly effective income tax rate was higher this quarter, at 21.75% versus 19.5% last quarter due to lower quarterly discrete items. Next quarter, option discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $128.4 million, up $6.9 million and was 35.6% of sales up from 35%. The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share decreased by 116,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset vesting of employee stock awards.  GAAP earnings per share was $0.52, up from $0.50 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $19.9 million, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.59 per share. 
Looking at just a few major components of our balance sheet, during the current quarter, the company's cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities increased by $55.3 million to $1.36 billion, net of spending $78.2 million of dividends which has been increased to $0.32 per share and spending $32.6 million on stock purchases of approximately 800,000 shares. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.2 million. Accounts receivable of $152.9 million increased by $7.8 million on the higher sales base and DSO was 39 days up from 38 days as we had an extra week of collections in the second quarter. Inventory at $94.2 million was essentially flat versus the prior quarter and we believe to be in good profile to support our business and keep lead times relatively short. Our quarterly average inventory terms were ups slightly to 3.7x per year. 
Looking forward, at the current bookings rate, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. Three quarters ago, when we announced that revenues for our first fiscal quarter would be down significantly, our expectation was that the sudden drop was more of a short-term correction rather than a deep down cycle. At this point, it appears that our reading of the tea leaves was accurate. Inventories in the channel now appear to be imbalanced, if not lean. We are shipping to end customer demand, bookings have picked up and our largest market, industrial, appears to be in recovery. However, there's still a fragile market. The global macroeconomic climate is not particularly favorable when certain geographies remain weak and GDP of 2% is considered good growth. Nevertheless, we feel good about our strategy and the growth opportunities ahead in the markets where we have focused our resources and product development, particularly in the industrial, transportation and communications markets. These are the markets that will drive the growth in high-performance analog, and the decisions that we made several years ago and executed upon now leave us well-positioned to capitalize. 
I will now open up the conference call to questions to be addressed to Bob, Lothar or me."

And that's going to double, we think, in '16. And right now, with the incentives that the Chinese government has put in place, they don't appear to be an end to this."

And so it's just an ever evolving field and it's -- the requirements are, obviously, it's precision. The lithium batteries are very expensive. And so if we can make the measurements more precise, it means they have to purchase less batteries. When your battery system stops working on a vehicle, whether a plug-in or a hybrid, the car stops. So they're looking for things like redundancies and backup systems so it's a pretty complicated product with a lot of different hooks in it, and every different -- every OEM has a different hop button."

And so I think what we're seeing now is the fact that we've given up most of the base station business. We don't have a lot of base station business to lose anymore and what we're seeing is just the pickup of the networking business, which we've been seeing really for years and that's becoming a little bit conspicuous now.

Can you help us quantify how much we should see for the June quarter? Is this a similar incremental margin that we've seen in March? And then on a similar vein, if you look at where gross margin are today, and I always feel silly asking this question, you're still above 200 basis points of upside to where margins were kind of back in that 2010 time period, around 78%. Is there anything structurally different about the business today that shouldn't allow you, at some point, get back to that margin profile?"

I mean, that was a snapback from the 2008, 2009 credit crisis and recession, and so the whole market was, if you recall, was sort of pedal to the metal. Our factory utilization at that time was very high. We still had some consumer products that were lower ASP, but also lower cost. That helped get to that very high gross margin. Not that we can't get back there, but that's sort of the perfect environment to get back to a gross margin that in excess of 78%. So I think that's different and you have to look at what that environment is. And secondly, there is some cost to the automotive market, the quality and the reliability that is expected. So, yes, there's higher ASPs there, but the cost, depending upon which product you're talking about, has quite high test costs. So there's that as well. But even on a slightly lower gross margin, the gross margin per unit is higher. So we'll make that trade off everyday. So there's -- i mean there's just a lot of variabilities that go into gross margin which is why I can't necessarily give you a target for what our gross margin is going to be next quarter. I don't know what the mix is going to be yet, I'm not exactly sure what our capacity level will be in the factory. All I can say is, say, look, we just grew about $13 million and added half of 0.50 basis points. I don't know I can promise another 50 basis points but assuming we grow, assuming we have a relatively sort of constant kind of a mix on our products. I would expect to that we would be able to add to gross margin in total, whether it's 20 basis points or 30 basis points or even higher, I can't say right now."

If you look at our company from where we're positioned, from a product standpoint, from an end market standpoint, we couldn't be any better-positioned than we are presently.

Maybe that factored into that. So with consumer gone, there seems to be maybe a less of a normal pattern. But just in general, clearly, the first half of the calendar year, our fiscal third and fourth quarters is seasonally strong for Linear, particularly because of our focus on industrial and transportation. So we assume that, that will stay that way going forward. We hope to grow in Q4. Going on beyond that, it's a difficult to forecast this business over the next quarter just because of the economy and some variability and the business and our customers. But, I mean, we would expect that coming out of the fourth quarter, historically, the first quarter has been a -- first fiscal quarter has been flattish to up slightly, down slightly type of quarter. And then Q2 has generally, be -- December quarter, has generally, been our weaker quarter when we go down slightly, although even in past year, that pattern was changed because September was the down quarter and we were recovering the December quarter. So you look at history and what happens, and there is somewhat of a pattern there, but it seems to have changed every year. So I'm not sure I would put too much on the seasonality, other than, clearly the first half of the calendar year tends to be stronger quarters for us. I would think that, that would continue absent some major change. I hope that answers your question."

So that's the easy one. You know it's funny, I guess I got caught on the one minor miss I made on the income statement, where I did say that I expected to be in the 31% range in Q1, if not better. So at 31.2%, that's exactly where we were in our first quarter. So I think that's what I said. But in fairness, I expected it to be a little better. And there's 2 things that -- and we're not talking about a lot of money. I think to get down to 31%, our operating expense would've been about $600,000 or $700,000 less, not a lot. But one thing I didn't factor into is surprisingly it's vacation. The way we do our accounting for vacation, I think what's most companies do. It's when employees are taking vacation, you actually get a P&L benefit and then when they're not taking vacation, vacation charges go up, and it's the way you accrue the vacation accrual. So one thing that I didn't factor is when you have a holiday period like Christmas and New Year's and then we also had shutdowns as well, people use their vacations so they can get paid rather than taking time off without pay. So this quarter, that sort of snapped back the other way because after people used their vacation, there's hardly any vacation taken at all. So the impact of that, quite honestly, was a little higher than I expected. And so at 31.2%, quite honestly, I would have thought we would have done a little bit better. But going forward, I think that 31% of sales is, give or take, is probably where you can find us. The second thing there, I think I'm been talking about this for the last couple of quarters is on an annual basis, if you take out stock compensation, our operating expenses are generally, increasing in the 3% to 4% range. And that's sort of typical. But stock compensation, which is non-cash, is increasing somewhat higher than that. And it's solely because our older grants that were granted 5 years ago were granted in the low $30 range. Well, those are falling off and being replaced by higher grants. So that phenomenon is causing stock compensation to increase quarter-over-quarter, a little faster than the rest of our cash operating expenses. So there's a little bit of pressure there. That will turn around eventually. But for now,, that's why you might see our operating expense in total growing maybe a little higher than you expect."

But when you look at January, for example, it's not unusual that bookings increased coming out of the December calendar year-end, and there might have been some pre-booking for Chinese New Year. So that's why you got to be a little careful when you try to read into the next quarter when you're on the call based upon a couple of weeks of bookings for the current quarter because there sometimes ends up being a spike sort of coming out of the different fiscal periods. But I said I said, think we have seen, just in general, our bookings per day have stabilized somewhat. So we're hoping that, that will continue. We continue to talk to our customers, and I think our feedback in general is they're feeling pretty good about their business. We talked about seasonality. Q3 and Q4 are generally stronger for Linear Tech. They're stronger for transportation and industrial. The transportation market continues to grow nicely for us.

And so we really were first to market with a viable product. And we're in a fourth-generation product right now in production,",373,"As far as competition, we recognized probably almost a decade ago that there is going to be the emergence of this BMS products. And so we really were first to market with a viable product. And we're in a fourth-generation product right now in production, and we've got sixth and seventh generation products and beyond in development. And so granted it's getting to be a visible market and competitors recognize it, and so there are competitors in this space, but I think we, for the foreseeable future, have a pretty good technical lead relative to the competition. These are complicated chips, I mean, they are very, very complicated. And as I mentioned earlier, there's no way that one competitor's going to come in with one chip because every OEM has a different preference of what they want. And so there is many variations on the BMS product. So even though we kind of call it a product, it's really a family of products. And I think we've got a good technical lead on the competition. In terms of automotive, in general, there's just great opportunities. The car companies are announcing this 48-volt battery systems, you're going to see them starting with model year '16, '17 and beyond. You're going to see it really picking up. When that happens, there's good opportunities for us. Silicon Valley here is becoming the new Detroit. Every OEMs here in Silicon Valley, there's some speculation, there's some new entrants in the automotive business developing in Silicon Valley as well. The one electric car manufacturer here in Silicon Valley is doing well. And so I think the domestic market for us is going to be good for automotive. It's been a little bit slow for us when we dealt with sort of the big Detroit automobile companies but we think a we're bit hard on ourselves because even though we didn't sell too much directly to OEM, we have a pretty good content in the U.S. cars because they buy a lot of subassemblies from overseas. And so what we're seeing now is sort of the indigenous design wins happening in the automotive market in the U.S., which we haven't had really strong, up until the last few years."

So we feel confident that this slow growth that you have seen overall in industrial is going to turn around and go a bit faster. Again our sales, generally happen 2 or 3 years out from when we get from our sales and our wins to production.

In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015, and our subsequent quarterly filings on Form 10-Q. 
Also, SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted in our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the March quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance at $361.1 million, up 4% from the December quarter. Gross margin increased to 76.2% from 75.7%, benefiting from the higher sales base, a full quarter production in our fabs and certain other manufacturing efficiencies. Recall that our second quarter had less production days in our fabs due to holidays and plant shutdown days. 
Operating margin improved to 45% of sales, up from 43.1%, due to the higher gross margin and 1 less week of operating expenses as we had 14 weeks in our second quarter. Our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the third quarter at 21.75% versus 19.5% in Q2 on lower discrete quarterly items. Net income and earnings per share were $128.4 million and $0.52 per share. 
All told, this was a pretty good quarter, and we are happy with the results given global macroeconomic that are still providing some headwinds. We beat the midpoint of our guidance. We increased gross margin and operating margin. And our bookings increased over the prior quarter at a level that should allow us to grow in the fourth quarter as well. The transportation market continues to grow nicely, and we are seeing recovery in the Industrial market and to a lesser extent the communications market, which has been weak for some time. We are seeing recovery across the broad based, including distribution and the smaller- and mid-sized customers. 
In general, inventories in the channel appear to be in balance, and we believe we are shipping to end customer demand. However, there remains pockets of weakness in certain geographies, and the computer market remains particularly weak, though that is not a major market for us. We remain cautious, given the general business climate. But based upon our third quarter bookings and our current run rate, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector. As a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com under Investor Relations Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter, and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in each of our major geographic regions: Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific. We continue to do particularly well in China as bookings were up the most in that region on the strength of automotive, though our Industrial business is growing in that country too. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, bookings were up in each of our major markets that represent 86% of our business, industrial, transportation and communications. In our smaller markets, military space grew modestly, while computer and consumer showed declines. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continued to be particularly weak. Industrial continues to be our largest market at 44% of our bookings, up from 43% the previous quarter. Industrial bookings increased in each of our major geographic regions led by North America and Europe. The breadth of this increase across our customer base is giving us some comfort that the noticeable weakness we experienced in this market over the past several months is in recovery and that the inventory correction that resulted is behind us. We believe we are shipping to end customer demand, and the inventories in the channel and at the OEMs are at least stable, if not lean. 
Turning to transportation bookings. This market continues to show the highest percentage growth, and it was 24% of our businesses this past quarter, up from 23%. The increase in bookings in Transportation was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific, but we saw growth in Japan and the U.S. as well. The U.S. has been a smaller transportation market for us, but we are making good strides here, and is up nicely for the quarter in percentage terms and opportunities to continues to increase. Europe bookings were down in transportation modestly in the quarter but coming off a relatively strong Q2. Transportation growth in Asia-Pacific continues to be strong, and it was our highest region in total transportation bookings, overtaking both Europe and Japan for the first time. As you should know by now, we have been particularly successful with our parts in the China and Korea market. As I have noticed on previous calls, China is all-in on electric vehicles as one part of the solution for the severe air pollution, offering incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric vehicles, including autos, taxis and buses. Our superior BMS parts have won a significant business in China, where we enjoy very high market share for battery management systems. Our transportation business in this region should continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable feature. 
Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter, but after 2 quarters of sequential growth, we are hopeful that this market is beginning to show some life. The large base stations and infrastructure piece of this market continues to be weak, but that is no longer a sizable piece of our communications business. We are seeing growth in optical, networking and datacom, which is the area of the market that we focus. This market was strongest for us in the U.S., while Europe was flat and Asia was down slightly. 
The computer market was 6% of our bookings, down from 7% last quarter, with the decrease primarily in North America where the majority of this business is booked. As stated last quarter, this market is down as expected as it is suffering due to weaker notebook sales and storage devices. This market may continue to decline a bit more for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline. But longer term, we expect growth opportunities as we have compelling products in development that address the higher end of this market where innovation and superior functionality are still needed. 
Bookings for military space and harsh environment products increased modestly this quarter and remained at 6% of our business. Military has rebounded slowly from the weakness we experienced in the first quarter, while the space business had been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to pick up as satellite launch activity increases. This is predominantly a U.S. market, but we do book some business in Europe. Both regions saw an increase in bookings this quarter. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market where we take business opportunistically when functionality and performance still matter. This market decreased to 2% of our business, down from 3% last quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally and 38% in North America, the same as last period. 
Moving to sales. Sales increased by 4% from the prior quarter and were down 2.9% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up the most in Europe, followed by North America and Asia-Pacific, but were down in Japan, which is not unusual as March is typically their fiscal year end. U.S. sales were up for both OEM and distribution, where revenue is recognized on sell-through basis. On a regional basis, North America was 28% of our business, up from 27% last quarter. Europe was up to 21% this quarter from 19% last quarter. Japan declined to 13% of our business, down from 15% in the last quarter. And Asia-Pacific decreased from 39% to 38% of sales but was up in absolute dollars. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin was up from 75.7% to 76.2%. This is a good result, particularly since our overseas assembly and test operations had lowered production days due to Chinese New Year. Gross margin was aided by the higher sales base, which reduces fixed overhead per unit, and an increase in our average selling price to $1.97, up from -- up $0.05 from $1.92 last quarter. The fourth quarter is a full production quarter for all of our plants, and we expect to grow sales. So I do expect some margin expansion subject to the product mix within sales. 
R&D decreased $0.2 million sequentially to $69.6 million, primarily due to lower labor and fringe costs as there was 1 extra week in the prior quarter. In addition, legal costs were down. Partially offsetting these decreases, vacation costs and profit sharing increased. Vacation costs were higher as there were no shutdown days and much less vacation taken in the third quarter than during the holiday season. 
SG&A decreased $0.4 million sequentially to $43 million. Similar to R&D, this was mostly due to lower labor and fringe costs from 1 less week in the quarter compared to Q2. In addition, other costs decreased such as advertising, travel and foreign sales cost from foreign exchange. Similar to R&D, these declines were partially offset by higher vacation costs and profit sharing. 
Operating income increased by $13 million to $162.5 million, representing 45% of our sales. Interest and other income increased slightly to $1.6 million on higher invested cash, net of small loss from foreign currency transactions. Our quarterly effective income tax rate was higher this quarter, at 21.75% versus 19.5% last quarter due to lower quarterly discrete items. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range.
Net income for the period was $128.4 million, up $6.9 million, and was 35.6% of sales up from 35%. The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share decreased by 116,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset vesting of employee stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.52, up from $0.50 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $19.9 million, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.59 per share. 
Looking at just a few major components of our balance sheet. During the current quarter, the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $55.3 million to $1.36 billion, net of spending $78.2 million at cash dividends, which have been increased to $0.32 per share, and spending $32.6 million on stock purchases of approximately 800,000 shares. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.2 million. 
Accounts receivable of $152.9 million increased by $7.8 million on the higher sales base. And DSO was 39 days, up from 38 days, as we had an extra week of collections in the second quarter. Inventory at $94.2 million was essentially flat versus the prior quarter and we believe to be in a good profile to support our business and keep lead times relatively short. Our quarterly average inventory turns was up slightly to 3.7x per year. 
Looking forward, at the current bookings rate, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. 3 quarters ago, when we announced our revenues for our first fiscal quarter would be down significantly, our expectation was that the sudden drop was more of a short-term correction rather than a deep down cycle. At this point, it appears that our reading of the tea leaves was accurate. Inventories in the channel now appear to be in balance, if not lean. We are shipping to end customer demand. Bookings have picked up. And our largest market, industrial, appears to be in recovery. 
However, it is still a fragile market. The global macroeconomic climate is not particularly favorable when certain geographies remain weak and GDP of 2% is considered good growth. Nevertheless, we feel good about our strategy and the growth opportunities ahead in the markets where we have focused our resources and product development, particularly in the industrial, transportation and communications markets. These are the markets that will drive the growth in high-performance analog. And the decisions that we made several years ago and executed upon now leave us well positioned to capitalize. 
I will now open up the conference call to questions to be addressed to Bob, Lothar or me."

And so I think what we're seeing now is the fact that we've given up most of the base station business. We don't have a lot of base station business to lose anymore. And what we're seeing is just the pickup of the networking business, which we've been seeing really for years, and that's becoming a little bit conspicuous now.

And so the whole market was, if you recall, was sort of pedal to the metal. Our factory utilization at that time was very high. We still had some consumer products that were lower ASP, but also lower cost, that helped get to that very high gross margin. Not that we can't get back there, but that's sort of the perfect environment to get back to a gross margin that is in excess of 78%. So I think that's different. And you have to look at what that environment is. And secondly, there is some cost to the automotive market, the quality and the reliability that is expected. So yes, there's higher ASPs there. But the cost, depending upon which product you're talking about, has quite high test costs. So there's that as well. But even on a slightly lower gross margin, the gross margin per unit is higher. So we make that trade off everyday. So there's -- I mean, there's just a lot of variabilities that go into gross margin, which is why I can't necessarily give you a target for what our gross margin is going to be next quarter. I don't know what the mix is going to be yet. I'm not exactly sure what our capacity level will be in the factory. All I can say is, say, look, we just grew about $13 million and added half of 0.50 basis points. I don't know if I can promise another 50 basis points. But assuming we grow, assuming we have a relatively sort of constant kind of a mix in our -- on our products, I would expect that we would be able to add to gross margin in total.

So all the new business and new opportunities we now felt after several years of replacing business was now additive on top. And so we were sort of there. And obviously, after 2014, we fell off that pace as did certainly the rest of the market as well. But we -- computer got weak, communications got weak, industrial got weak on us. So again, there's some macroeconomic headwinds. But to Lothar's point, with a little bit more stability and a little bit more growth on average around the globe, we think we can grow back up at that 10% range. And we think we've already shown we could do it. We just need some help from the market."

Maybe that factored into that. And so with consumer gone, there seems to be maybe a less of a normal pattern. But just in general, clearly, the first half of the calendar year, our fiscal third and fourth quarters is seasonally strong for Linear, particularly because of our focus on industrial and transportation. So we assume that, that will stay that way going forward. We hope to grow in Q4. Going on beyond that, it's very difficult to forecast this business over the next quarter just because of the economy and some variability in the business and our customers. But I mean, we would expect that coming out of the fourth quarter, historically, the first quarter has been a -- first fiscal quarter has been a flattish to up slightly, down slightly type of quarter. And then Q2 has generally -- that's the December quarter, has generally been our weaker quarter where we go down slightly, although even in past year, that pattern was changed, because we -- September was the down quarter and we were recovering in the December quarter. So you look at history and what happens, and there is somewhat of a pattern there, but it seems to have changed every year. So I'm not sure I would put too much on the seasonality, other than clearly the first half of the calendar year tends to be stronger quarters for us. I would think that, that would continue absent some major change. I hope that answers your question."

So that's the easy one. It's funny, I guess, I got caught on the one minor miss I made on the income statement, where I did say that I expected to be in the 31% range, similar to Q1, if not better. And so at 31.2%, that's exactly where we were in our first quarter. So I think that's what I said. But in fairness, I expected it to be a little better. And there's 2 things that -- and we're not talking about a lot of money. I think to get down to 31%, that would -- our operating expense would've been about $600,000 or $700,000 less, not a lot. But one thing I didn't factor into, surprisingly, it's vacation. The way we do our accounting for vacation, I think it's what's the most companies do. It is when employees are taking vacation, you actually get a P&L benefit. And then when they're not taking vacation, vacation charges go up, and it's the way you accrue the vacation accrual. So one thing that I didn't factor is when you have a holiday period like Christmas and New Year's and then we also had shutdowns as well, people use their vacations so that they can get paid rather than taking time off without pay. So this quarter, that sort of snapped back the other way, because after people used their vacation, there's hardly any vacation taken at all. So the impact of that, quite honestly, was a little higher than I expected. And so at 31.2%, quite honestly, I would have thought that we've done a little bit better. But going forward, I think that 31% of sales is, give or take, is probably where you're going to find us. The second thing there -- and I think I've been talking about this the last couple of quarters is, on an annual basis, if you take out stock compensation, our operating expenses are generally increasing in the 3% to 4% range. And that's sort of typical. But stock compensation, which is noncash, is increasing somewhat higher than that. And it's solely because our older grants that were granted 5 years ago were granted in the low $30 range. Well, those are falling off and being replaced by higher grants. So that phenomenon is causing stock compensation to increase quarter-over-quarter a little faster than the rest of our cash operating expenses. So there's a little bit of pressure there. That will turn around eventually. But for now, that's why you might see our operating expenses in total growing maybe a little higher than you'd expect."

But when you look at January, for example, it's not unusual that bookings increase coming out of the December calendar year end, and there's -- there might have been some prebooking for Chinese New Year. So that's why you got to be a little careful when you try to read into the next quarter when you're on the call based upon a couple of weeks of bookings for the current quarter, because there sometimes ends up being a spike sort of coming out of the different fiscal periods. But I said I think we've seen, just in general, our bookings per day have stabilized somewhat. So we're hoping that, that will continue. We continue to talk to our customers, and I think our feedback in general is they're feeling pretty good about their business. We talked about seasonality. And Q3 and Q4 are generally stronger for Linear Tech. They're stronger for transportation and industrial. The transportation market continues to grow nicely for us. So just based upon that information, that's why we're feeling good about our position, that's why we're feeling pretty good that we can continue to grow in the fourth quarter.

And so we really were first to market with a viable product. And we're in a fourth-generation product right now in production, and we've got sixth- and seventh-generation products and beyond in development. And so granted it's getting to be a visible market and competitors recognize it, and so there are competitors in this space. But I think we, for the foreseeable future, have a pretty good technical lead relative to the competition. These are complicated chips. I mean, they're very, very complicated. And as I mentioned earlier, there's no way that one competitor is going to come in with one chip, because the -- every OEM has a different preference of what they want. And so there is many variations on the BMS product. So even though we kind of call it a product, it's really a family of products. And I think we've got a good technical lead on the competition. In terms of automotive, in general, there's just great opportunities. The car companies are announcing this 48-volt battery systems. You're going to see them starting with model year '16, '17 and beyond. You're going to see it really picking up. When that happens, there's good opportunities for us. Silicon Valley here is becoming the new Detroit. Every OEMs here in Silicon Valley, a couple of -- there's some speculation, there's some new entrants in the automotive business developing in Silicon Valley as well. The one electric car manufacturer here in Silicon Valley is doing well. And so I think the domestic market for us is going to be good for automotive. It's been a little bit slow for us when we dealt with sort of the big Detroit automobile companies. But we're, I think, a little bit hard on ourselves, because even though we didn't sell too much directly to the OEMs, we had a pretty good content in the U.S. cars, because they buy a lot of subassemblies from overseas. And so what we're seeing now is sort of the indigenous design wins happening in the automotive market in the U.S., which we haven't had really strong up until the last few years."

Certainly if gas prices be -- started to go up again, we'll see a pickup in sort of the exploration part of the market. Some of the alternative energy stuff where we're starting to see interest in solar and wind, that could be a good market for us as well in the future. We pick that up in the industrial business.

I mean, the bookings back 3 quarters ago, they almost fell off the cliff a little bit surprisingly, where customers that are booking at a steady pattern suddenly stopped booking and that, that was large customers as well as the smaller customers.

But even we said back then that even though there was weakness and you saw the decline in bookings, most of our customers, and we're talking thousands, were still optimistic about their business and they were growing.

They tend to be, for the most part, pretty general purpose. We probably initially developed these products to access small- and medium-sized customers, customers that we couldn't send our application engineers to visit.

We sell these to many, many small- and medium-sized customers who don't have the in-house expertise. Somewhat to our surprise, they've also done very well in large and sophisticated customers who do have in-house analog capabilities. But we win that business really on 2 fronts. One front is because it's done, they get a time-to-market advantage. And two, it's in the footprint that even if they could do the analog design themselves, they could never do it in a small of a footprint. And so -- but all those things are not directed to one specific market. We probably initially saw strength in sort of the communications market with the micromodules. Now it's expanded to all over the place. We even have module now that goes into automotive applications. And my sense is we're probably going to see more of that as well.

Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. 
As noted in our press release, which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the March quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance at $361.1 million, up 4% from the December quarter. Gross margin increased to 76.2% from 75.7%, benefiting from the higher sales base, a full quarter production in our fabs and certain other manufacturing efficiencies. Recall that our second quarter had less production days in our fabs due to holidays and plant shutdown days. 
Operating margin improved to 45% of sales, up from 43.1%, due to the higher gross margin and 1 less week of operating expenses as we had 14 weeks in our second quarter. Our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the third quarter at 21.75% versus 19.5% in Q2 on lower discrete quarterly items. Net income and earnings per share were $128.4 million and $0.52 per share. 
All told, this was a pretty good quarter, and we are happy with the results given global macroeconomic conditions that are still providing some headwinds. We beat the midpoint of our guidance. We increased gross margin and operating margin. And our bookings increased over the prior quarter at a level that should allow us to grow in the fourth quarter as well. The transportation market continues to grow nicely, and we are seeing recovery in the Industrial market and to a lesser extent the communications market, which has been weak for some time. We are seeing recovery across the broad base, including distribution in the smaller- and mid-sized customers. 
In general, inventories in the channel appear to be in balance, and we believe we are shipping to end customer demand. However, there remains pockets of weakness in certain geographies, and the computer market remains particularly weak, though that is not a major market for us. We remain cautious, given the general business climate. But based upon our third quarter bookings and our current run rate, we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. 
Turning to bookings by region and market sector. As a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com under Investor Relations Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we release our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter, and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased in both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in each of our major geographic regions: Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific. We continue to do particularly well in China as bookings were up the most in that region on the strength of automotive, though our Industrial business is growing in that country too. 
With respect to bookings by market sector, bookings were up in each of our major markets that represent 86% of our business: industrial, transportation and communications. In our smaller markets, military space grew modestly, while computer and consumer showed declines. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continued to be particularly weak. Industrial continues to be our largest market at 44% of our bookings, up from 43% the previous quarter. Industrial bookings increased in each of our major geographic regions led by North America and Europe. The breadth of this increase across our customer base is giving us some comfort that the noticeable weakness we experienced in this market over the past several months is in recovery and that the inventory correction that resulted is behind us. We believe we are shipping to end customer demand, and the inventories in the channel and at the OEMs are at least stable, if not lean. 
Turning to transportation bookings. This market continues to show the highest percentage growth, and it was 24% of our businesses this past quarter, up from 23%. The increase in bookings in Transportation was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific, but we saw growth in Japan and the U.S. as well. The U.S. has been a smaller transportation market for us, but we are making good strides here, and is up nicely for the quarter in percentage terms and opportunities  continues to increase. Europe bookings were down in transportation modestly in the quarter but coming off a relatively strong Q2. Transportation growth in Asia-Pacific continues to be strong, and it was our highest region in total transportation bookings, overtaking both Europe and Japan for the first time. 
As you should know by now, we have been particularly successful with our parts in the China and Korea market. As I have noticed on previous calls, China is all-in on electric vehicles as one part of the solution for the severe air pollution, offering incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric vehicles, including autos, taxis and buses. Our superior BMS parts have won a significant business in China, where we enjoy very high market share for battery management systems. Our transportation business in this region should continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable future. 
Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter, but after 2 quarters of sequential growth, we are hopeful that this market is beginning to show some life. The large base stations and infrastructure piece of this market continues to be weak, but that is no longer a sizable piece of our communications business. We are seeing growth in optical, networking and datacom, which is the area of the market that we focus. This market was strongest for us in the U.S., while Europe was flat and Asia was down slightly. 
The computer market was 6% of our bookings, down from 7% last quarter, with the decrease primarily in North America where the majority of this business is booked. As stated last quarter, this market is down as expected as it is suffering due to weaker notebook sales and storage devices. This market may continue to decline a bit more for us over the short term as notebook sales continue to decline. But longer term, we expect growth opportunities as we have compelling products in development that address the higher end of this market where innovation and superior functionality are still needed. 
Bookings for military space and harsh environment products increased modestly this quarter and remain at 6% of our business. Military has rebounded slowly from the weakness we experienced in the first quarter, while the space business had been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to pick up as satellite launch activity increases. This is predominantly a U.S. market, but we do book some business in Europe. Both regions saw an increase in bookings this quarter. 
Finally, consumer, our smallest end market where we take business opportunistically when functionality and performance still matter. This market decreased to 2% of our business, down from 3% last quarter. With regard to where our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally and 38% in North America, the same as last period. 
Moving to sales. Sales increased by 4% from the prior quarter and were down 2.9% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up the most in Europe, followed by North America and Asia-Pacific, but were down in Japan, which is not unusual as March is typically their fiscal year end. U.S. sales were up for both OEM and distribution, where revenue is recognized on sell-through basis. On a regional basis, North America was 28% of our business, up from 27% last quarter. Europe was up to 21% this quarter from 19% last quarter. Japan declined to 13% of our business, down from 15% last quarter. And Asia-Pacific decreased from 39% to 38% of sales but was up in absolute dollars. 
Turning to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin was up from 75.7% to 76.2%. This is a good result, particularly since our overseas assembly and test operations had lower production days due to Chinese New Year. Gross margin was aided by the higher sales base, which reduces fixed overhead per unit, and an increase in our average selling price to $1.97, up from -- up $0.05 from $1.92 last quarter. The fourth quarter is a full production quarter for all of our plants, and we expect to grow sales. So I do expect some margin expansion subject to the product mix within sales. 
R&D decreased $0.2 million sequentially to $69.6 million, primarily due to lower labor and fringe costs as there was 1 extra week in the prior quarter. In addition, legal costs were down. Partially offsetting these decreases, vacation costs and profit sharing increased. Vacation costs were higher as there were no shutdown days and much less vacation taken in the third quarter than during the holiday season. 
SG&A decreased $0.4 million sequentially to $43 million. Similar to R&D, this was mostly due to lower labor and fringe costs from 1 less week in the quarter compared to Q2. In addition, other costs decreased such as advertising, travel and foreign sales cost from foreign exchange. Similar to R&D, these declines were partially offset by higher vacation costs and profit sharing. 
Operating income increased by $13 million to $162.5 million, representing 45% of our sales. Interest and other income increased slightly to $1.6 million on higher invested cash, net of small loss from foreign currency transactions. Our quarterly effective income tax rate was higher this quarter, at 21.75% versus 19.5% last quarter due to lower quarterly discrete items. Next quarter, absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range.
Net income for the period was $128.4 million, up $6.9 million, and was 35.6% of sales up from 35%. The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share decreased by 116,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period, more than offset vesting of employee stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.52, up from $0.50 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $19.9 million, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.59 per share. 
Looking at just a few major components of our balance sheet. During the current quarter, the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $55.3 million to $1.36 billion, net of spending $78.2 million at cash dividends, which have been increased to $0.32 per share, and spending $32.6 million on stock purchases of approximately 800,000 shares. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.2 million. 
Accounts receivable of $152.9 million increased by $7.8 million on the higher sales base. And DSO was 39 days, up from 38 days, as we had an extra week of collections in the second quarter. Inventory at $94.2 million was essentially flat versus the prior quarter and we believe to be in good profile to support our business and keep lead times relatively short. Our quarterly average inventory turns was up slightly to 3.7x per year. 
Looking forward, at the current bookings rate, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. 3 quarters ago, we announced our revenues for our first fiscal quarter would be down significantly. Our expectation was that the sudden drop was more of a short-term correction rather than a deep down cycle. At this point, it appears that our reading of the tea leaves was accurate. Inventories in the channel now appear to be in balance, if not lean. We are shipping to end customer demand. Bookings have picked up. And our largest market, industrial, appears to be in recovery. 
However, it is still a fragile market. The global macroeconomic climate is not particularly favorable when certain geographies remain weak and GDP of 2% is considered good growth. Nevertheless, we feel good about our strategy and the growth opportunities ahead in the markets where we have focused our resources and product development, particularly in the industrial, transportation and communications markets. These are the markets that will drive the growth in high-performance analog. And the decisions that we made several years ago and executed upon now leave us well positioned to capitalize.

These things evolve literally over years. And we've seen some stress on our communications business, because historically, it was roughly evenly split between the base station and the networking part of the business. And over the years, what we've been seeing is the base station, which has become somewhat commoditized, that business declining, and the rest of the business, the sort of the networking and infrastructure part of the business improving. And so I think what we're seeing now is the fact that we've given up most of the base station business. We don't have a lot of base station business to lose anymore. And what we're seeing is just the pickup of the networking business, which we've been seeing really for years, and that's becoming a little bit conspicuous now. 
There are also some segments in the networking business that are doing well. Don mentioned the optical business. There -- wherever there's a lot of innovation is typically where Linear does well.

And so the whole market was, if you recall, was sort of pedal to the metal. Our factory utilization at that time was very high. We still had some consumer products that were lower ASP, but also lower cost, that helped get to that very high gross margin. Not that we can't get back there, but that's sort of the perfect environment to get back to a gross margin that is in excess of 78%. So I think that's different. And you have to look at what that environment is. 
And secondly, there is some cost to the automotive market, the quality and the reliability that is expected. So yes, there's higher ASPs there. But the cost, depending upon which product you're talking about, has quite high test costs. So there's that as well. But even on a slightly lower gross margin, the gross margin per unit is higher. So we -- we'll make that trade off every day. 
So there's -- I mean, there's just a lot of variabilities that go into gross margin, which is why I can't necessarily give you a target for what our gross margin is going to be next quarter. I don't know what the mix is going to be yet. I'm not exactly sure what our capacity level will be in the factory. All I can say is, say, look, we just grew about $13 million and added half of 0.50 basis points. I don't know if I can promise another 50 basis points. But assuming we grow, assuming we have a relatively sort of constant kind of a mix in our -- on our products, I would expect that we would be able to add to gross margin in total. Whether it's 20 basis points or 30 basis points or even higher, I can't say right now."

Maybe that factored into that. And so with consumer gone, there seems to be maybe a less of a normal pattern. But just in general, clearly, the first half of the calendar year, our fiscal third and fourth quarters is seasonally strong for Linear, particularly because of our focus on industrial and transportation. So we assume that, that will stay that way going forward. We hope to grow in Q4. Going on beyond that, it's very difficult to forecast this business over the next quarter just because of the economy and some variability in the business and our customers. But I mean, we would expect that coming out of the fourth quarter, historically, the first quarter has been a -- first fiscal quarter has been a flattish to up slightly, down slightly type of quarter. And then Q2 has generally -- that's the December quarter, has generally been our weaker quarter where we go down slightly, although even in past year, that pattern was changed, because we -- September was the down quarter and we were recovering in the December quarter. 
So you look at history and what happens, and there is somewhat of a pattern there, but it seems to have changed every year. So I'm not sure I would put too much on the seasonality, other than clearly the first half of the calendar year tends to be stronger quarters for us. I would think that, that would continue absent some major change. I hope that answers your question."

So that's the easy one. It's funny, I guess, I got caught on the one minor miss I made on the income statement, where I did say that I expected to be in the 31% range, similar to Q1, if not better. And so at 31.2%, that's exactly where we were in our first quarter. So I think that's what I said. But in fairness, I expected it to be a little better. And there's 2 things that -- and we're not talking about a lot of money. I think to get down to 31%, that would -- our operating expense would've been about $600,000 or $700,000 less, not a lot. 
But one thing I didn't factor into, surprisingly, is vacation. The way we do our accounting for vacation, I think it's the way most companies do it, is when employees are taking vacation, you actually get a P&L benefit. And then when they're not taking vacation, vacation charges go up, and it's the way you accrue the vacation accrual. So one thing that I didn't factor is when you have a holiday period like Christmas and New Year's and then we also had shutdowns as well, people use their vacations so that they can get paid rather than taking time off without pay. So this quarter, that sort of snapped back the other way, because after people used their vacation, there's hardly any vacation taken at all. So the impact of that, quite honestly, was a little higher than I expected. And so at 31.2%, quite honestly, I would have thought that we've done a little bit better. But going forward, I think that 31% of sales is, give or take, is probably where you're going to find us. 
The second thing there -- and I think I've been talking about this the last couple of quarters is, on an annual basis, if you take out stock compensation, our operating expenses are generally increasing in the 3% to 4% range. And that's sort of typical. But stock compensation, which is noncash, is increasing somewhat higher than that. And it's solely because our older grants that were granted 5 years ago were granted in the low $30 range. Well, those are falling off and being replaced by higher grants. So that phenomenon is causing stock compensation to increase quarter-over-quarter a little faster than the rest of our cash operating expenses. So there's a little bit of pressure there. That will turn around eventually. But for now, that's why you might see our operating expenses in total growing maybe a little higher than you'd expect."

But when you look at January, for example, it's not unusual that bookings increase coming out of the December calendar year end, and there's -- there might have been some prebooking for Chinese New Year. So that's why you got to be a little careful when you try to read into the next quarter when you're on the call based upon a couple of weeks of bookings for the current quarter, because there sometimes ends up being a spike sort of coming out of the different fiscal periods. But I said and I think we've seen, just in general, our bookings per day have stabilized somewhat. So we're hoping that, that will continue. We continue to talk to our customers, and I think our feedback in general is they're feeling pretty good about their business. We talked about seasonality. And Q3 and Q4 are generally stronger for Linear Tech. They're stronger for transportation and industrial. The transportation market continues to grow nicely for us. So just based upon that information, that's why we're feeling good about our position; that's why we're feeling pretty good that we can continue to grow in the fourth quarter.

And we're in a fourth-generation product right now in production, and we've got sixth- and seventh-generation products and beyond in development. And so, granted, it's getting to be a visible market and competitors recognize it, and so there are competitors in this space. But I think we, for the foreseeable future, have a pretty good technical lead relative to the competition. These are complicated chips. I mean, they're very, very complicated. And as I mentioned earlier, there's no way that one competitor is going to come in with one chip, because the -- every OEM has a different preference of what they want. And so there is many variations on the BMS product. So even though we kind of call it a product, it's really a family of products. And I think we've got a good technical lead on the competition. 
In terms of automotive, in general, there's just great opportunities. The car companies are announcing this 48-volt battery systems. You're going to see them starting with model year '16, '17 and beyond. You're going to see it really picking up. When that happens, there's good opportunities for us. Silicon Valley here is becoming the new Detroit. Every OEMs here in Silicon Valley, a couple of -- there's some speculation. There's some new entrants in the automotive business developing in Silicon Valley as well. The one electric car manufacturer here in Silicon Valley is doing well. And so I think the domestic market for us is going to be good for automotive. It's been a little bit slow for us when we dealt with sort of the big Detroit automobile companies. But we're, I think, a little bit hard on ourselves, because even though we didn't sell too much directly to the OEMs, we had a pretty good content in the U.S. cars, because they buy a lot of subassemblies from overseas.

The -- there's these very complicated ASICs that are involved in these optical systems. They have many, many power rails that need to be powered, and it has to be done with very high efficiency, because these things are in very small, compact, not very well cooled locations. And so there's a lot of electronics to get this optical stuff to work. And I think we've got some good solutions in small footprints. Our micromodules do well in that area. They have a footprint that you can't do discreetly. So those products do well in optical. And it's really in the sort of -- not the photonics part of itself, it's in the support of the electronics that go into the photonics."

How much of that would be what you talked about a little bit there as just sort of returning back to normal demand post sort of an inventory correction versus end market demand picking up versus you guys just having good designs that are taking off. So I guess, I'm trying to get at, how much of this is just through end market demand picking up versus good stuff that you guys have done?"

I mean, the bookings back 3 quarters ago, they almost fell off a cliff a little bit surprisingly, where customers that were booking at a steady pattern suddenly stopped booking and that, that was large customers as well as the smaller customers. So I think there was a couple of quarters where they took their inventory levels down maybe to coincide with their own lower growth, optimistic growth rates. But even we said back then that even though there was weakness and you saw the decline in bookings, most of our customers, and we're talking thousands, were still optimistic about their business and they were growing. So I think it's probably both that they're getting back to their usual levels of booking. Their inventories are in good profile. But we think we're growing from there. So we think we've got growth ahead, that this is more than just sort the snapback from a correction."

They tend to be, for the most part, pretty general purpose. We probably initially developed these products to access small- and medium-sized customers, customers that we couldn't send our application engineers to visit. So we've given these modules, which like you said, is kind of a system in a package. It's a done analog solution. All they have to do is sodder it down on a board, and that worked. We sell these to many, many small- and medium-sized customers who don't have the in-house expertise. Somewhat to our surprise, they've also done very well in large and sophisticated customers who do have in-house analog capabilities. But we win that business really on 2 fronts. One front is because it's done; they get a time-to-market advantage. And two, it's in a  footprint that even if they could do the analog design themselves, they could never do it in a small of a footprint. And so -- but all those things are not directed to one specific market. We probably initially saw strength in sort of the communications market with the micromodules. Now it's expanded to all over the place. We even have module now that goes into automotive applications. And my sense is we're probably going to see more of that as well. So it's not targeted to any specific end market."
