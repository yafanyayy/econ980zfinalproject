Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. 
Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our Form 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. 
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to updated predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2016.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. 
In our discussion of results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given under comparable constant-currency basis, which at this time, generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.

The last 3 months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO had flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. 
This morning, I will share my thoughts on the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year. I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated in the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.
I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw early in the year continue. 
For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9%, with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.
Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for Waters' products and services in Q4 increased 4%, led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment, which were up 6% in the quarter. 
Full year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.
Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the second quarter against the very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales to the segment were about flat. Sales to the food environmental and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter, with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China.
For the full year, sales to this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.
From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew to 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our benchtop LC and LC/MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. 
For the full year, Waters' instrument platform sales were up 10%. Acuity in Alliance sales technology systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continue to expand the usage of MS detection classic LCN markets. 
On the high-resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new bion IMS top platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues the combination of servicing chemistry consumables grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.
Water Service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenues spreading much of the growth. 
On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of a strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements and the continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing. 
Now I'd like to cover Waters Division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S,  sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors were offset by a decline in government spending. 
Full year sales in the U.S. were up 10%, with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories. Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter, pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, government and academic business declined and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. 
Looking at the full year, Waters European sales were up 7%. And similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major product lines and end markets. 
In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, with our mix well-balanced between privately and publicly funded customers. As I saw first hand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term.
Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. 
Looking at the full year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year. 
In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography.
In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instrument services, columns and network information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's results. 
Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic markets. 
Finally, from a business segment standpoint, PA instruments performance rebounded nicely from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.
So to recap  last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan, while we smoothly transitioned to a new CEO and also smartly invested for future growth. Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong top line performance was delivered, while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a constant-currency basis. Event  with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel. 
As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: first, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth; second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success; and third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation. 
I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one. 
In 2015, we launched significant new instruments, including the ACQUITY arc and the aforementioned buy-on IMS soft. in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY system is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays. In the relatively short time, this product has been the market, we are already seeing the system strength. 
Similarly, the IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are interest in adoption of a ion mobility mass spectrometry. These ground-breaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms, including Allianz Acuity and mass spec. 
In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits, such as the glycol works labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefit -- benefiting Waters sales growth and market share gains. 
In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.
I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo, has decided to retire at the end of 2016 and he will serve as a nonexecutive adviser to me throughout the year. It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact in this country. He's been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who is personally influence our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. 
While I already have the pleasure to work with Art for a short 6 months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been the many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed. Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent, as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity, that will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. 
So on behalf of all Waters' employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career. 
I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee and the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments in our future outlook. Gene?"

In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96 in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year 2015 sales grew about 9% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. 
On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.
Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%; Europe was up 3%; Japan was flat; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%, with strong demand in India and China. 
On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3% and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. 
TA sales were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, with new technology offerings and acquired products benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and Asia where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4% as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impact the gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impact of -- positive impact in product mix in manufacturing cost dynamics. 
Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field headcount to ensure customer support. 
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 2% in the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
On the tax front, our effective -- our operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was reestablished at year's end. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million.
As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves  $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 3 days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter.
In the quarter, inventories inclined -- declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical and markets and stable growth in our current revenues. Along with the growth from TA instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. 
Currency translation at today's rate is expected to reduce 2016 growth -- sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.
Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year is expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains we will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.
We expect to manage our constant currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rates.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have planned -- we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 80 million shares of -- 81 million shares. 
Rolling all these together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35.
Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales were growth at a rate of about 3% to 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce the first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27.
Thank you, and Chris?"

And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area, but to be -- the complexity of the molecules that are -- being worked on, the discovery phase, the development phase, continues to grow. And the demand for more characterization is there. And so we're seeing a nice steady trend in that area. We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve."

Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India's good sources of growth that I've mentioned although it is a balance and there's other geographies in the emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower. That's more than being offset by China and India in particular. And when you mentioned the instrument demand, the difference one of the differences in the market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So there's the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue of piece, particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base, which is a good trend because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well. As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies, and those types of market, I'll let Gene comment a little farther, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so we're watching that closely, but we -- as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lead to ability to our business overtime. So really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together, those 2 geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth. And while growth always is a straight line and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets are both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall."

That's a good question, John, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper and overtime. Let me start with where you begin. You're right, mid-single digit is, I think, a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year. And really, that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions, whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong '15 and the good of the consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year, but even some of the prior years. And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with the new product platform, internal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on the number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth. And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we're positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow on the top line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for. And we're going to continue our regularly -- a regular share buyback program. So when you take all that and we do expect EPS leverage, as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our top line growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on look and try to gain some modest of operating leverage, while investing for growth, but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's -- I've not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard."

Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business, a large portion of our business goes to the related environment of the pharmaceutical industry, biopharmaceutical industry. Traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our integration strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them so we have  continuity. The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now and that strategy was designed -- it was designed to evolve. And at each -- every several -- every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY going to the H-Class, going to the arc and other innovations, what you'll find is that we maintained a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year, which took advantage of what we saw as to market moving at evolving in the presence of ACQUITY. So the Arc is proving to be highly successful in that it wouldn't exist -- that Prince Edward wouldn't probably exist if ACQUITY didn't exist.

We will have some new products this year that we're not in a position to announce yet and that will just add to our portfolio. But the way I think about it is the uptake of products that have been -- that are early in their cycle. And certainly, the ones to highlight the build up in our traditional platforms of alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we talked about that's a couple of years in the market, but really on a pretty steep curve as well as the TQ-S -- the Xevo TQ-S micro, which is really turned into a work course product in mass spec applications, particularly in applied markets like food and environmental. And then the ACQUITY Ark, which Gene instrument talked quite a bit about. And then the latest one is the IMS QTof that really going to bring new dimensions to define a resolution in the marketplace. And so I'm looking at those 4 products for example, plus some other things for later this year and certainly expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be in unexpected market growth of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY. In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess I'm still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products, but it's going to be a continuing theme every year. Added several points last year and I expect that will be -- those -- in that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate."

And really, honestly, trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives. But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. It was -- we increased our R&D spending on as-reported basis of 10% and we're upwards of mid-teens on a constant-currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that. In the coming year, I expect we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue. Probably not as faster than revenue as it was in '15 because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio."

And that's just in response to what we've seen is a very healthy and market and that includes 2014 as well as 2015. And so as we enter 2016, we're going to start the year of comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison. We also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We looked at the mid-single-digit topline growth is something that's reasonable, given the strength that we had in 2015 delivering high single -- almost a 10% growth rate for the company. So hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger topline growth rate. But at this point so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another topline performance as we had in 2015. So we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable even if not everything materializes in a positive direction."

And in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about 1 percentage loss of earn revenue. So if you have 4 less selling days and recurring revenues make up about half of your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points associated with the selling days. In addition and it's hard to quantify. It does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2-plus percentage points of growth. That's a good way to think about it. As we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is 1 less selling day in the first quarter of '16. So we're using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days in the fourth quarter. That would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associated with selling days. So not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were audible bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?"

The last 3 months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO had flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. 
This morning, I will share my thoughts on the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year. I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.
I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw early in the year continued. 
For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9%, with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.
Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for Waters' products and services in Q4 increased 4%, led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment, which were up 6% in the quarter. 
Full year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.
Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the second quarter against a very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales to the segment were about flat. Sales to the food, environmental and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter, with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China.
For the full year, sales to this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.
From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew to 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our bench-top LC and LC/MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. 
For the full year, Waters' instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC technology systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continued to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LCN markets. 
On the high-resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of servicing chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.
Waters Service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth. 
On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements and the continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing. 
Now I'd like to cover Waters Division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S, sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. 
Full year sales in the U.S. were up 10%, with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories. Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits. Government and academic business declined, and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. 
Looking at the full year, Waters European sales were up 7%. And similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major product lines and end-markets. 
In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers. As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term.
Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. 
Looking at the full year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year. 
In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography.
In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instrument services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's results. 
Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market. 
Finally, from a business segment standpoint, PA instruments performance rebounded nicely from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.
So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan, while we smoothly transitioned to a new CEO and also smartly invested for future growth. Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong topline performance was delivered, while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a constant-currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel. 
As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: First, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth; second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success; and third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation. 
I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one. 
In 2015, we launched significant new instruments, including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Watched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc system is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays. In the relatively short time this product has been the market, we are already seeing the system strength. 
Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we were seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These ground-breaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms, including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo mass spec. 
In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits, such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters sales growth and market share gains. 
In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.
I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo, has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a nonexecutive adviser to me throughout the year. It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this country. He's been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. 
While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short 6 months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps, Art's greatest contribution has been the many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed. Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent, as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity, that will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. 
So on behalf of all Waters' employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career. 
I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee and the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future.

In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sa",996,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, all. In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96, in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year 2015, sales grew about 9% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share, versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. 
On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.
Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%; Europe was up 3%; Japan was flat; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%, with strong demand in India and China. 
On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. 
TA sales were up 16% during the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, with new technology offerings and acquired products benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and Asia, where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4%, as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impact of -- positive impacts of product mix in manufacturing cost dynamics. 
Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field headcounts to ensure customer support. 
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 2% during the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
On the tax front, our effective -- our operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was reestablished at year's end. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million.
As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves  $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditure, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 3 days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter.
In the quarter, inventories inclined -- declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. 
Currency translation at today's rate is expected to reduce 2016 growth -- sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.
Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year is expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.
We expect to manage our constant currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to -- we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 80 million shares of -- 81 million shares. 
Rolling all these together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35.
Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce the first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27.
Thank you, and Chris?"

Obviously, we think we're seeing a trend in the market towards a broader and more diversified pharma end market that's not nearly as concentrated in the traditional large pharmaceutical companies as it has been in the past, but we're seeing a lot of activity in the biotech world and specialty pharma. And obviously, our generics business, particularly in India, has been a major source of growth. Yes, the comparisons are tough, but we do anticipate that the market trends that we're seeing in every face of the market -- of the pharmaceutical market from the discovery and development all the way through QC and production, all remain relatively stable.

I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector. What I've noticed, and I'd been out into the market quite a bit visiting customers in terms of the large biotech companies as well as a number of start-up companies, is there is a rush of innovation in that industry. And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area, but to be -- the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase, the development phase, continues to grow. And the demand for more characterization is there. And so we're seeing a nice steady trend in that area. We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve."

Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India's good sources of growth that I've mentioned, although it is a balance and there's other geographies in the emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower. That's more than being offset by China and India in particular. And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So there's the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue of piece, particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base, which is a good trend, because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well. As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies, and those types of markets, I'll let Gene comment a little bit farther, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so we're watching that closely, but we -- as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business overtime. So really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together, those 2 geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth. And while growth always hasn't been a straight line and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall."

That's a good question, John, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper and overtime. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is, I think, a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year. And really, that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions, whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong '15 and a good outlook consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year, but even some of the prior years. And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform, internal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth. And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we're positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow on the top line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for. And we're going to continue our regularly -- a regular share buyback program. So when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage, as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our topline growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on look and try to gain some modest degree of operating leverage, while investing for growth, but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's -- I've not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard."

Trying to get a read on how large merger like that affects our business is challenging and a little bit like the effects that we see from the large pharmaceutical mergers together. The one thing I can say is that a lot of these mergers to me, and I had visited a lot of these companies through my travels, feel like they are driven to -- by strategic reasons to actually increase the amount of innovation that those firms are able to generate, while gaining efficiencies in other areas to pay for innovation. And so we're just keeping our heads down and trying to act no differently, even though those are larger companies and try to stay away from any defocusing with their -- with what they're going through and just support  them in anyway we can.

It's designed to be able to accommodate column lengths that are typically used in these applications, but it also affords the use of the opportunity to experiment with UPLC columns and see what the differences are in resolution and speed between UPLC and HPLC. What we found going to market is that there are a number of customers that want to exactly replicate methodologies that were created on systems like our Alliance. And we've designed the ACQUITY Arc to be able to seamlessly translate a method from a system like the Alliance LC system to the ACQUITY Arc system. So that is the primary difference. The H-Class is designed with component free and with the fluidic path that's more targeted to those people who are going to move methodology from HPLC to UPLC rather than the audience for the Arc that may want to continue, for a prolonged period of time, to use an HPLC methodology.

Maybe, I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business -- a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment of the pharmaceutical industry -- biopharmaceutical industry, traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them, so we have continuity. The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now and as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each -- every several -- every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY going to the H-Class, going to the Arc and the other innovations, what you'll find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year, which took advantage of what we saw as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY. So the Arc is proven to be highly successful in that it wouldn't exist -- that segment probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so -- and I think that the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolution to this technology, because it's a very powerful platform and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday."

We will have some new products this year that we're not in a position to announce yet, and that will just add to our portfolio. But the way I think about it is the uptake of products that have been -- that are early in their cycle. And certainly, the ones to highlight the build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about. That's a couple of years in the market, but really on a pretty steep curve as well as the TQ-S -- the Xevo TQ-S micro, which is really turned into a work course product in mass spec applications, particularly in applied markets like food and environmental. And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about. And now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining a resolution in the marketplace. And so I'm looking at those 4 products for example, plus some other things for later this year and, certainly, expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an unexpected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY. In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess I'm still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products, but it's going to be a continuing theme every year. Added several points last year and I expect that it'll be -- those -- that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate."

And really, obviously, I'm trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives. But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. It was -- we increased our R&D spending on an as-reported basis of 10% and we're upwards of mid-teens on a constant-currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that. In the coming year, I expect we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue. Probably not as faster than revenue as it was in '15, because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio."

And that's just in response to what we've seen as a very healthy end market and that includes 2014 as well as 2015. And so as we enter 2016, we're going to start the year of comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison. And we also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We looked at the mid-single-digit topline growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015 delivering a high single -- almost a 10% growth rate for the company. So hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger topline growth rate. But at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another topline performance as we had in 2015. So we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction."

As you know, one of the elements of the TA business model is to do small tuck-in acquisitions that are under resourced in terms of the previous companies they were in. And it takes us a little bit of time sometimes to build up that capacity and we saw some of that towards the end of the year. And really, as we look to '16, we do see some carry forward there to your point. But also the main event in 2016 for TA is the midyear launch of the new discovery series of thermal analysis family.

In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues, in a more understandable way than it does the capital sales business. And in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about 1 percentage loss of earned revenue. So if you have 4 less selling days and recurring revenues make up about half of your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associated with the selling days. In addition, and it's hard to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2-plus percentage points of growth. That's a good way to think about it. As we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant-currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is 1 less selling day in the first quarter of '16. So using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days in the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associated with selling days. So not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?"

In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1, under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. 
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update the predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2016.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. 
In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given under comparable constant-currency basis, which at this time generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.

The last 3 months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO have flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. 
This morning, I will share my thoughts on the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year. I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.
I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw early in the year continued. 
For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9%, with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.
Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for Waters' products and services in Q4 increased 4%, led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment, which were up 6% in the quarter. 
Full year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.
Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the quarter against a very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales to the segment were about flat. Sales to the food, environmental and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter, with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China.
For the full year, sales to this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.
From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew to 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our bench-top LC and LC/MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. 
For the full year, Waters' instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC technology systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continued to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LCN markets. 
On the high-resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.
Waters Service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth. 
On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements and the continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing. 
Now I'd like to cover Waters Division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S, sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. 
Full year sales in the U.S. were up 10%, with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories. Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits. Government and academic business declined, and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. 
Looking at the full year, Waters European sales were up 7%. And similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major product lines and end-markets. 
In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers. As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term.
Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. 
Looking at the full year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year. 
In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography.
In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instrument services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's results. 
Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market. 
Finally, from a business segment standpoint, PA instruments performance rebounded nicely from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.
So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan, while we smoothly transitioned to a new CEO and also smartly invested for future growth. Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong topline performance was delivered, while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a constant-currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel. 
As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: First, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth; second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success; and third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation. 
I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one. 
In 2015, we launched significant new instruments, including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Watched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc system is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays. In the relatively short time this product has been on the market, we are already seeing the system's strength. 
Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These ground-breaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms, including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo mass spec. 
In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits, such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters' sales growth and market share gains. 
In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.
I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo, has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a nonexecutive adviser to me throughout the year. It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this company. He's been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. 
While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short 6 months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been the many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed. Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent, as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity, that will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. 
So on behalf of all Waters' employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career. 
I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee and the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?"

In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96, in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year 2015, sales grew about 9% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share, versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. 
On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.
Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%; Europe was up 3%; Japan was flat; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%, with strong demand in India and China. 
On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. 
TA sales were up 16% during the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, with new technology offerings and acquired products benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and Asia, where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4%, as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impact of -- positive impacts of product mix in manufacturing cost dynamics. 
Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field headcounts to ensure customer support. 
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 2% during the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
On the tax front, our effective -- our operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was reestablished at year's end. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million.
As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditure, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 3 days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter.
In the quarter, inventories inclined -- declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. 
Currency translation at today's rate is expected to reduce 2016 growth -- sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.
Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year is expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.
We expect to manage our constant currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to -- we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 80 million shares -- 81 million shares. 
Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35.
Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce the first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27.
Thank you, and Chris?"

I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector. What I've noticed, and I'd been out into the market quite a bit visiting customers in terms of the large biotech companies as well as a number of start-up companies, is there is a rush of innovation in that industry. And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area, but to be -- the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase, the development phase, continues to grow. And the demand for more characterization is there. And so we're seeing a nice steady trend in that area. We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve."

Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India's good sources of growth that I've mentioned, although it is a balance and there's other geographies in the emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower. That's more than being offset by China and India in particular. And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So there's the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue piece, particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base, which is a good trend, because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well. As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies, and those types of markets, I'll let Gene comment a little bit farther, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so we're watching that closely, but we -- as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business over time. So really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together, those 2 geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth. And while growth always hasn't been a straight line and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall."

That's a good question, John, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper and over time. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is, I think, a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year. And really, that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions, whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong '15 and a good outlook consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year, but even some of the prior years. And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform, in thermal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth. And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we're positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow on the top line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for. And we're going to continue our regularly -- our regular share buyback program. So when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage, as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our topline growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on look and try to gain some modest degree of operating leverage, while investing for growth, but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's -- I've not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard."

Our business in these areas, and in particularly in TA, you mentioned TA, is very, very diversified geographically and very diversified in terms of customers with very few customers that represent a significant portion of the business. And so we're just trying to work collaboratively with these customers to make sure that they can continue their investments in our products in their capital throughout this cycle. There undoubtedly are effects in certain end markets and certain geographies and certain customer segments, but at this point in time, we're just trying to manage through that and would certainly highlight any major dislocations or gaps as we see them materialize."

So we have a new structure that is going to enable me to be one step more hands-on. It's going to, I believe, accentuate our competitive advantages by organizing around major product groupings in terms of the platforms group and then the applied technologies group, which combines our strength in chemistry, service and informatics. It gives us the opportunity to have an integrated go-to-market organization, sales and marketing under another leader. And really, what we're going to do is we're going to evolve into a set of operating mechanisms that are very crisp and very regular in terms of enabling each of those large functional leaders to translate our strategy to execution and to do so in a very efficient way. So those processes are well under development. We really don't expect to miss a beat.

It's designed to be able to accommodate column lengths that are typically used in these applications, but it also affords the use of the opportunity to experiment with UPLC columns and see what the differences are in resolution and speed between UPLC and HPLC. What we found going to market is that there are a number of customers that want to exactly replicate methodologies that were created on systems like our Alliance. And we've designed the ACQUITY Arc to be able to seamlessly translate a method from a system like the Alliance LC system to the ACQUITY Arc system. So that is the primary difference. The H-Class is designed with componentry and with the fluidic path that's more targeted to those people who are going to move methodology from HPLC to UPLC rather than the audience for the Arc that may want to continue, for a prolonged period of time, to use an HPLC methodology.

Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business -- a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment of the pharmaceutical industry -- biopharmaceutical industry, traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them, so we have continuity. The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now and as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each -- every several -- every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY going to the H-Class, going to the Arc and the other iterations, what you'll find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year, which took advantage of what we saw as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY. So the Arc is proven to be highly successful in that it wouldn't exist -- that segment probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so -- and I think that the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolution to this technology, because it's a very powerful platform and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday."

We will have some new products this year that we're not in a position to announce yet, that will just add to our portfolio. But the way I think about it is, is the uptake of products that have been -- that are early in their cycle. And certainly, the ones to highlight that build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about. That's a couple of years in the market, but really on a pretty steep curve as well as the TQ-S -- the Xevo TQ-S micro, which has really turned into a workhorse product in mass spec applications, particularly in applied markets like food and environmental. And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about. And now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining a resolution in the marketplace. And so I'm looking at those 4 products, for example, plus some other things for later this year and, certainly, expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an expected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY. In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess I'm still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products, but it's going to be a continuing theme every year. Added several points last year and I expect that it'll be -- those -- that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate."

And really, obviously, I'm trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives. But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. It was -- we increased our R&D spending on an as-reported basis of 10% and we're upwards of mid-teens on a constant-currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that. In the coming year, I expect we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue. Probably not as faster than revenue as it was in '15, because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio."

And that's just in response to what we've seen as a very healthy end market, and that includes 2014 as well as 2015. And so as we enter 2016, we're going to start the year off comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison. And we also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We look at the mid-single-digit topline growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015 delivering a high single -- almost a 10% growth rate for the company. So hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger topline growth rate. But at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another topline performance as we had in 2015. So we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction."

In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues, in a more understandable way than it does the capital sales business. And in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about 1 percentage loss of earned revenue. So if you have 4 less selling days and recurring revenues make up about half of your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associate it with the selling days. In addition, and it's hard to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2-plus percentage points of growth. That's a good way to think about it. As we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant-currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is 1 less selling day in the first quarter of '16. So using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days in the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associated with selling days. So not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?"

The last 3 months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO have flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. 
This morning, I will share my thoughts on the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year. I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.
I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw early in the year continued. 
For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9%, with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.
Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for Waters' products and services in Q4 increased 4%, led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment, which were up 6% in the quarter. 
Full year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.
Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the quarter against a very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales to the segment were about flat. Sales to the food, environmental and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter, with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China.
For the full year, sales to this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.
From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew to 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our bench-top LC and LC/MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. 
For the full year, Waters' instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC technology systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continued to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LCN markets. 
On the high-resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.
Waters Service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth. 
On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements and the continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing. 
Now I'd like to cover Waters Division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S, sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. 
Full year sales in the U.S. were up 10%, with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories. Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits. Government and academic business declined, and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. 
Looking at the full year, Waters European sales were up 7%. And similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major product lines and end-markets. 
In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers. As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term.
Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. 
Looking at the full year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year. 
In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography.
In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instrument services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's results. 
Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market. 
Finally, from a business segment standpoint, PA instruments performance rebounded nicely from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.
So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan, while we smoothly transitioned to a new CEO and also smartly invested for future growth. Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong top line performance was delivered, while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a constant-currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel. 
As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: First, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth; second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success; and third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation. 
I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one. 
In 2015, we launched significant new instruments, including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Watched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc system is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays. In the relatively short time this product has been on the market, we are already seeing the system's strength. 
Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These ground-breaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms, including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo mass spec. 
In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits, such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters' sales growth and market share gains. 
In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.
I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo, has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a nonexecutive adviser to me throughout the year. It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this company. He's been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. 
While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short 6 months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been the many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed. Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent, as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity, that will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. 
So on behalf of all Waters' employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career. 
I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee and the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?"

In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96, in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year 2015, sales grew about 9% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share, versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. 
On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.
Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%; Europe was up 3%; Japan was flat; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%, with strong demand in India and China. 
On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. 
TA sales were up 16% during the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, with new technology offerings and acquired products benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and Asia, where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4%, as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impact of -- positive impacts of product mix in manufacturing cost dynamics. 
Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field headcounts to ensure customer support. 
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 2% during the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
On the tax front, our effective -- our operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was reestablished at year's end. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million.
As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditure, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 3 days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter.
In the quarter, inventories inclined -- declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. 
Currency translation at today's rate is expected to reduce 2016 growth -- sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.
Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year is expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.
We expect to manage our constant currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to -- we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 80 million shares -- 81 million shares. 
Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35.
Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce the first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27.
Thank you, and Chris?"

I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector.

And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area, but to be -- the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase, the development phase, continues to grow. And the demand for more characterization is there. And so we're seeing a nice steady trend in that area. We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control.

Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India's good sources of growth that I've mentioned, although it is a balance and there's other geographies in the emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower. That's more than being offset by China and India in particular. And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So there's the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue piece, particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base, which is a good trend, because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well. As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies, and those types of markets, I'll let Gene comment a little bit farther, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so we're watching that closely, but we -- as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business over time. So really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together, those 2 geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth.

And if you dig a little bit more deeply into that, you find that there's a heavy component -- that the heavy component of higher end mass spectrometry within that number. So in our -- from our past experience, we tend to see that business be somewhat lumpy for us. We're encouraged by the increased funding that we see for next year. And if I take a look at the results that we reported in the fourth quarter and maybe some of the slowness there, the majority of that can be accounted for by a very strong performance in the prior year."

That's a good question, John, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper and over time. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is, I think, a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year. And really, that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions, whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong '15 and a good outlook consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year, but even some of the prior years. And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform, in thermal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth. And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we're positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow on the top line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for. And we're going to continue our regularly -- our regular share buyback program. So when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage, as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our top line growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on look and try to gain some modest degree of operating leverage, while investing for growth, but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's -- I've not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard."

Trying to get a read on how a large merger like that affects our business is challenging and a little bit like the effects that we see from the large pharmaceutical mergers together. The one thing I can say is that a lot of these mergers to me, and I have visited a lot of these companies through my travels, feel like they are driven to -- by strategic reasons to actually increase the amount of innovation that those firms are able to generate, while gaining efficiencies in other areas to pay for innovation. And so we're just keeping our heads down and trying to act no differently, even though those are larger companies that try to stay away from any defocusing with their -- with what they're going through and just support them in any way we can.

Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business -- a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment of the pharmaceutical industry -- biopharmaceutical industry, traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them, so we have continuity. The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now and as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each -- every several -- every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY going to the H-Class, going to the Arc and the other iterations, what you'll find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year, which took advantage of what we saw as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY. So the Arc is proven to be highly successful in that it wouldn't exist -- that segment probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so -- and I think that the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolution to this technology, because it's a very powerful platform and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday."

And Isaac, as I think about new products and given the pattern of how new products are introduced, I do take a little bit of a longer view than just those introduced this coming year. We will have some new products this year that we're not in a position to announce yet, that will just add to our portfolio. But the way I think about it is, is the uptake of products that have been -- that are early in their cycle. And certainly, the ones to highlight that build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about. That's a couple of years in the market, but really on a pretty steep curve as well as the TQ-S -- the Xevo TQ-S micro, which has really turned into a workhorse product in mass spec applications, particularly in applied markets like food and environmental. And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about. And now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining a resolution in the marketplace. And so I'm looking at those 4 products, for example, plus some other things for later this year and, certainly, expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an expected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY. In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess I'm still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products, but it's going to be a continuing theme every year. Added several points last year and I expect that it'll be -- those -- that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate."

That's a good question and that's something I'm laser-focused on, because innovation is my #1 priority in terms of our growth model. And really, obviously, I'm trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives. But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. It was -- we increased our R&D spending on an as-reported basis of 10% and we're upwards of mid-teens on a constant-currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that. In the coming year, I expect we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue. Probably not as faster than revenue as it was in '15, because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio."

If I take a look at the spending in the base year 2015, I think what you saw is us ramp spending across the year, ramp spending up on the SG&A side, but more on the S side and on the R&D side. And that's just in response to what we've seen as a very healthy end market, and that includes 2014 as well as 2015. And so as we enter 2016, we're going to start the year off comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison. And we also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We look at the mid-single-digit top line growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015 delivering a high single -- almost a 10% growth rate for the company. So hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger top line growth rate. But at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another top line performance as we had in 2015. So we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction."

In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues, in a more understandable way than it does the capital sales business. And in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about 1 percentage loss of earned revenue. So if you have 4 less selling days and recurring revenues make up about half of your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associate it with the selling days. In addition, and it's hard to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2-plus percentage points of growth. That's a good way to think about it. As we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant-currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is 1 less selling day in the first quarter of '16. So using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days in the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associated with selling days. So not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?"

The last 3 months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO have flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. 
This morning, I will share my thoughts on the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year. I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.
I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw early in the year continued. For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9%, with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.
Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for Waters products and services in Q4 increased 4%, led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment, which were up 6% in the quarter. Full year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.
Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the quarter against a very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales to this segment were about flat. Sales to the food, environmental and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter, with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China. For the full year, sales to this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.
From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew at a 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our benchtop LC and LC/MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. For the full year, Waters' instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC technology systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continued to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LC end markets. 
On the high resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter. Waters' service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth. 
On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements and a continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing. 
Now I'd like to cover Waters Division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S., sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. Full year sales in the U.S. were up 10%, with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories. 
Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, government and academic business declined and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. Looking at the full year, Waters European sales were up 7%. And similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major product lines and end markets. 
In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers. As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term. Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. Looking at the full year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year. 
In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography. In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instruments, services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's result. 
Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market. Finally, from a business segment standpoint, TA Instruments performance rebounded nicely from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.
So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must complement all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan while we smoothly transition to a new CEO and also smartly invested for future growth. Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong top line performance was delivered while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a constant currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high single-digit rate while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel. 
As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: First, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter while also investing for future growth; second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success; and third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation. I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one. 
In 2015, we launched significant new instruments including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Launched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc system is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays. In the relatively short time this product has been on the market, we are already seeing the system's strength. 
Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These ground-breaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms, including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo mass spec. 
In consumables, we continued to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters' sales growth and market share gains. In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.
I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo, has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a nonexecutive adviser to me throughout the year. It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this company. He has been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters' technology over the years. 
While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short 6 months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been the many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed. Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent, as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity, it will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. 
So on behalf of all Waters employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career. I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee and the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?"

Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96 in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year 2015, sales grew about 9% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.
Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%, Europe was up 3%, Japan was flat and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14% with strong demand in India and China. On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. TA sales were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, with new technology offerings and acquired products benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and Asia, where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4% as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impact of -- positive impacts of product mix and manufacturing costs dynamics. 
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field headcounts to ensure customer support. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 2% in the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
On the tax front, our effective -- our operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was reestablished at year's end. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million. As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. 
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditure, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 3 days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories inclined -- declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to reduce 2016 growth -- sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. We expect to manage our constant currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to -- we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 80 million shares -- 81 million shares. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.10 to $6.35.
Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27.
Thank you, and Chris?"

Obviously, we think we're seeing a trend in the market towards a broader and more diversified pharma end market that's not nearly as concentrated in the traditional large pharmaceutical companies as it has been in the past, but we're seeing a lot of activity in the biotech world in specialty pharma. And obviously, our generics business, particularly in India, has been a major source of growth. Yes, the comparisons are tough, but we do anticipate that the market trends that we're seeing in every phase of the market -- of the pharmaceutical market from discovery and development all the way through QC and production, ought to remain relatively stable.

I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector. What I've noticed, and I've been out into the market quite a bit visiting customers in terms of the large biotech companies as well as a number of start-up companies, is there is a rush of innovation in that industry. And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area. But to be -- the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase and the development phase continues to grow and the demand for more characterization is there. And so we're seeing a nice, steady trend in that area. We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve."

Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India as good sources of growth that I mentioned, although it is a balance and there's other geographies in the emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower. That's more than being offset by China and India in particular. And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So there's the traditional replacement business, there's obviously a strong recurring revenue piece, particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base, which is a good trend because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well. As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies in those types of markets, I'll have Gene comment a little bit further, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies and so we're watching that closely. But we -- as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business over time. So really we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together those 2 geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth. And while growth always isn't in a straight line and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall."

That's a good question, Jon, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper in over time. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is, I think, a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year. And really that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions, whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly the recurring revenue stream after a strong '15 and a good outlook consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year, but even some of the prior years. And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform in thermal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth. And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we're positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow on the top line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for and we're going to continue our regularly -- our regular share buyback program. So when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our top line growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on look -- on trying to gain some modest degree of operating leverage while investing for growth, but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's -- I have not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard."

Trying to get a read on how a large merger like that affects our business is challenging and a little bit like the effects that we see from the large pharmaceutical mergers together. The one thing I can say is that a lot of these mergers to me, and I visited a lot of these companies through my travels, feel like they're driven to -- by strategic reasons to actually increase the amount of innovation that those firms are able to generate while gaining efficiencies in other areas to pay for innovation. And so we're just keeping our heads down and trying to act no differently, even though those are larger companies and try to stay away from any defocusing with their -- with what they're going through and just support them in any way we can.

It's designed to be able to accommodate column lengths that are typically used in these applications, but it also affords the user the opportunity to experiment with UPLC columns and see what the differences are in resolution and speed between UPLC and HPLC. What we've found going to market is that there are a number of customers that want to exactly replicate methodologies that were created on systems like our Alliance and we've designed the ACQUITY Arc to be able to seamlessly translate a method from a system like the Alliance LC system to the ACQUITY Arc system. So that is the primary difference. The H-Class is designed with componentry and with the fluidic path that's more targeted to those people who are going to move methodology from HPLC to UPLC rather than the audience for the Arc that may want to continue for a prolonged period of time to use an HPLC methodology.

Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business -- a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment -- pharmaceutical industry -- biopharmaceutical industry -- traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them so we have continuity. The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now and as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each -- every several -- every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY going to the H-Class, going to the Arc and the other iterations, what you find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year, which took advantage of what we saw as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY. So the Arc has proven to be highly successful in that it wouldn't exist -- that segment probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so -- and I think the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolutions of this technology because it's a very powerful platform and it's -- and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday."

We will have some new products this year that we're not in a position to announce yet, that will just add to our portfolio. But the way I think about it is, is the uptake of products that have been -- that are early in their cycle. And certainly, the ones to highlight that build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about. That's a couple years in the market, but really on a pretty steep curve as well as the TQ-S -- the Xevo TQ-S micro, which has really turned into kind of a workhorse product in mass spec applications, particularly in applied markets like food and environmental. And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about. And now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining resolution in the marketplace. And so I'm looking at those 4 products, for example, plus some other things for later this year and certainly expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an expected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY. In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess I'm still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products, but it's going to be a continuing theme every year. I added several points last year and I expect that it'll be -- those -- that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate."

And really, obviously, trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives. But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. It was -- we increased our R&D spending on an as-reported basis of 10% and upwards of mid-teens on a constant currency basis and that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that. In the coming year, I expect we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue, probably not as faster than revenue as it was in '15 because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions.

And that's just in response to what we've seen as a very healthy end market and that includes 2014 as well as 2015. And so as we enter 2016, we are going to start the year off comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison. And we also know that in our business the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year and, frankly, it's further away. We look at the mid-single-digit top line growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015 delivering a high single -- almost a 10% growth rate for the company. So hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger top line growth rate. But at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another top line performance as we had in 2015. So we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction."

To comment on TA, we did see a nice acceleration at the year and TA that's really a broad-based variety of factors and one element of which is some of the more newly acquired businesses that we picked up over the course of the year and the prior years as we build capacity. As you know, one of the elements of the TA business model is to do small tuck-in acquisitions that are under-resourced in terms of the previous companies they were in. And it takes us a little bit of time sometimes to build up that capacity and we saw some of that towards the end of the year. And really, as we look to '16, we do see some carryforward there to your point. But also the main event in 2016 for TA is the midyear launch of the new Discovery Series thermal analysis family. It's an exciting new product platform that will really pave the way for the next level of evolution of that product line and solid growth for the next couple years. So we're excited about that. And Gene, there was one for you?"

In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues in a more understandable way than it does the capital sales business. And in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about a percentage loss of recurring revenue. So if you have 4 less selling days and recurring revenues make up about half of your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associate it with the selling days. In addition, and it's harder to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2-plus percentage points of growth is a good way to think about it. As we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year, so it's a tough base of comparison. But in terms of selling days, there is one less selling day in the first quarter of '16. So using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days in the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associated with the selling day. So not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?"

Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding the future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.
For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.
In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.
Lastly, as you recall, in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments division. So today, on this call and into the future, we will now refer to the Waters products and markets in TA Instruments products and markets.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?"

Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.
Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. 
Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter, as the results largely materialized as we expected. 5% revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance, which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter was up 15%, making for a challenging base of comparison as we enter 2016.
Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring revenue products and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple quarter trends in these key growth drivers.
Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets, the highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets, such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last 2 years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty engineering customers. 
Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter, with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S.
Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions. And the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1%, with strong shipments of research LC/MS systems in China, offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. 
Waters' instrument sales grew 2%, weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc system and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems, as well as through upgrades to existing systems. On the research mass spectrometry side, we begin regular shipments of IBS QTof in the quarter.
Waters' recurring revenues, a combination of service and consumables, led our product categories in the quarter, posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result, and with 1 fewer selling day. Waters service and support business grew at a 7% rate, with performance geographically broad based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans.
Consumables 8% growth was largely balance across major geographical regions, with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC columns. In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application-specific pre-analytic kits, such as the [indiscernible] MS labeling and our newly released protein works kits.
Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.
In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made the decision to launch the new discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsford conference, which have the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter, but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016.
Featuring new instruments for DSC or differential scanning and TGA or thermal gravimetric analysis, this new product line represents a step function improvement in performance and utility for TA's core business. Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon, with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks.
We expect the new discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.
Geographically, we saw a decent balance, with most -- with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets.
In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth, led by a low teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by a strong quarterly comparison, as well as TA's discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.
In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase, with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth, offset by a lower governmental and academic shipments. 
Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate, with strong demand from China and India.
Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid teens, with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.
I also continued to be impressed with the growth of our business in India, where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high-single digits, with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. 
I feel we're off to a good start this year, with solid revenue performance against the tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers. Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continued to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation, as well as our well-established share repurchase program. 
While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point, we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers, as well as our expectation for increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.
At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs. 
Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments, so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invent towards better solutions. 
Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on 3 continents. This process has been energizing. It has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams and the growth opportunities ahead of us.
Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter, while also transitioning to our new globally integrated organizational structure. I am very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.
Now I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales grow",851,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. 
In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15, and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year.
Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08. And without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.
Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad based, with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 5%, while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC/MS instruments system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.
Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8%, with TA service revenue up 9%.
Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation: U.S. sales were up 2%; Europe, also up 2%; Japan was up 8%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.
Sales of Waters products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.
Now I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. 
Gross margins for the quarter came in at about as expected at 57.7%, with a moderate currency headwind.
Moving down the P&L. 
SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis.
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter, and on a constant currency basis were up 2%, primarily as a result of a weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.
In the quarter, net interest expense were $6 million. And our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year. This being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million.
As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditure, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansion.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.
Now I will discuss our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. And we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rate is expected to be about equal to sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. 
Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015, as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full year negative FX dynamic.
We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line. 
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million. We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. 
Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted shares are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40.
Looking at the second quarter of 2016, we are estimating the sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter. Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48.
And with that, I turn you back to Chris."

And your point on price is also correct, that we do seek, overtime, to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumables side, we are benefiting from a continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries, which is a nice natural tailwind for us, in addition to some of the application-specific kits that I mentioned early, and we're very excited about works and protein works and other things in our pipeline. So this is a -- this has been a nice growth for us. It's gradually increasing as a mix of overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it, so it is a top priority for us."

Obviously, over the last 3 years, when I think of -- as I look back in the last 2, 3 years, I think there's been good operating leverage masked by FX, of course, and the challenges we faced there. And so as we look at 2016 as a little more of a transition year as it relates to FX, we are trying to balance that growth and the investment in the portfolio, obviously, with a good topline over the last year and continuing to push the top line, we want to make sure we're feeding that growth with the right levels of investment. And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets are harmonizing more to our guidance range, and we have an investment plan over the course of the year that is designed to yield some very very modest leverage. Obviously, with topline performance, if topline performance exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage. But obviously, over the course of time, I do feel that leverage is possible in this business based on the mix and the evolving mix of our business, particularly towards servicing consumables, the fact that we operate in very attractive market segments and the opportunities for scale up and down the P&L as we grow. So that's really our approach, but overall, it is a balanced approach, because it is, as I mentioned in my comments, feeding the growth is critical, particularly on the innovation side."

And as I have been vocal about, remain very, very committed to our position, I believe in the industry, is the most vital organic innovator. And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company's made great strides in recent years sort of the portfolio approach, and certainly, some of the organization evolution that I have been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio. One thing I have tried to take a look at, because there is so much innovation, is a crisper definition of a difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is there's a lot happening on both scores. Just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline, but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road. As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our instruments for LC/MS and MS instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly, the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories in a more integrated view of our product portfolio, and so that's certainly feedback effort from many customers and the dialogue internally, and I think the teams making great progress. I also want to comment on TA because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products, but on the TA side, the discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace. And while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation is going to make a big difference as well."

I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of '15 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma, but also biotech, generic specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low to mid single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth, which came from some of those other pools. And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification. There was also a geographic diversification, for example, in the generic business. There is a very strong presence in India, as well as different parts of Europe, and even a visit I had in Canada where there's a tremendous amount of innovation, and growth and scale in that generics category, and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category. So it continues to impress me as I get out to see customers that some of the old divisions maybe between who you'd expect to be developing small molecule drugs and larger molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field. The level of innovation is high, and it -- but it's a more balanced approach. So we obviously watch this closely.

And I think, as you correctly noted, that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There will be more material expenses, there will be more marketing expenses associated with that. And if you do a rough calculation, you'd see that our full year EPS guide doesn't really have baked into it the 200 basis points of leverage that we delivered in the first quarter on an organic constant currency basis, but much more moderate.

And we love our core and we'll continue to seek first to optimize that. Beyond that, it's really a matter of gaining more and more clarity on where we see the upside growth opportunities in terms of some of the growing markets, new markets and even geographic markets. And I think some of the themes we've talked about even in some of these calls reinforce what those are. At the end of the day, we are taking a pretty deep, and structured and thoughtful approach to this planning process.

The growth in the quarter there was broad based, as we pointed out, pharma in particular was strong, maybe a little easier comparison but had a good year-over-year growth, and -- but the end markets there were reasonable. So Japan historically has been more of a developed market, more mid-single-digit type growth, low to mid-single digit type growth. And so when we get a quarter like this out of Japan, we're excited.

The comps were a little tougher in the first quarter, get a little bit easier over the course of the year generally. And obviously, one of the big factors in our overall industrial outlook is the DSC and the TGA. In particular, the level of performance around sensitivity in resolution of those BSC and TGA products is going to impact a number of their end markets, particularly, for example, high performance industrial polymer markets, aerospace, semiconductor, some of those types of markets. But I think another market that is beyond the traditional thermal analysis market in TA that's pretty interesting to us is rheology. I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market and I'm pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly, as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rheology. So TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes, and while they are obviously heavily entrenched and tied to the industrial markets, we do obviously try to subset that market effectively and make sure we're pouring resources into some of those areas that we think can give us growth."

Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. 
During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding the future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.
For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.
In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges, given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.
Lastly, as you recall, in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments division. So today on this call and into the future, we will now refer to the Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.

Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.
Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. 
Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter as results largely materialized as we expected. 5% revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance, which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter were up 15%, making for a challenging base of comparison as we enter 2016.
Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring revenue products and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple-quarter trends in these key growth drivers.
Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets. The highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last 2 years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty and generic customers. 
Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S.
Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions, and the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1% with strong shipments of research LC/MS systems in China offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. 
Waters' instrument sales grew 2% weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems as well as through upgrades to existing systems. On the research mass spectrometry side, we began regular shipments of Vion IMS QTof in the quarter.
Waters' recurring revenues, a combination of service and consumables, led our product categories in the quarter, posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result and with 1 fewer selling day. Waters' service and support business grew at a 7% rate with performance geographically broad based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans. Consumables' 8% growth was largely balanced across major geographical regions with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns. In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application-specific pre-analytic kits such as the GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling and our newly released ProteinWorks kits.
Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.
In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made the decision to launch the new Discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsburgh  Conference, which had the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016.
Featuring new instruments for DSC, or differential scanning calorimetry, and TGA, or thermalgravimetric analysis (sic) [ thermogravimetric analysis ], this new product line represents a step function improvement in performance for -- in utility for TA's core business. Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks.
We expect the new Discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.
Geographically, we saw a decent balance with most -- with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets. In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth led by a low-teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by strong quarterly comparison as well as TA's Discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.
In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth, offset by lower governmental and academic shipments. 
Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate with strong demand from China and India.
Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid-teens with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.
I also continue to be impressed with the growth of our business in India, where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high-teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high single digits with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. 
I feel we're off to a good start this year with solid revenue performance against the tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers. Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continued to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation as well as our well-established share repurchase program. 
While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers as well as our expectation for an increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.
At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs. 
Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invest towards better solutions. Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on 3 continents. This process has been energizing and has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams and the growth opportunities ahead of us.
Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter while also transitioning to our new, globally integrated organizational structure. I'm very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.
Now I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales grow",853,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. 
In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08. And without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.
Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad based with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 5% while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.
Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8% with TA service revenue up 9%.
Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation. U.S. sales were up 2%, Europe also up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.
Sales of Waters products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.
 
Now I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. 
Gross margins for the quarter came in at about as expected at 57.7% with a moderate currency headwind.
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis.
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter and on a constant currency basis were up 2% primarily as a result of a weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million. And our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million.
As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. 
Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.
Now I will discuss our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. And we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about equal to sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full year negative FX dynamic.
We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million. 
We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. 
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding. 
Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40.
Looking at the second quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter. 
Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48.
And with that, I'll turn you back to Chris."

And your point on price is also correct that we do seek over time to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumables side, we are benefiting from continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries, which is a nice natural tailwind for us, in addition to some of the application-specific kits that I mentioned early, and we're very excited about GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks and other things in our pipeline. So this is a -- this has been a nice source of growth for us. It's gradually increasing as a mix of overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it.

And so we do believe that in the core LC business, we are gradually picking up some market share, and that's our goal. And we need to continue to feed that with innovation, which is our primary lever. On the mass spec side, it's a little bit different by product category. While we've been under some pressure on the higher end research mass spec, we have performed in a solid way in the tandem quad business and particularly the new category of the QDa. It's been a nice gainer for us.

And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets harmonizing more to our guidance range.

Obviously, with top line performance, if top line performance, say, exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage. But obviously, over the course of time, I do feel that leverage is possible in this business based on the mix and the evolving mix of our business, particularly towards service and consumables, the fact that we operate in very attractive market segments and the opportunities for scale up and down the P&L as we grow. So that's really our approach. But overall, it is a balanced approach because, as I mentioned in my comments, feeding the growth is critical, particularly on the innovation side."

And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company has made great strides in recent years on sort of the portfolio approach. And certainly, some of the organization evolution that I've been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio. One thing  I've tried to take a look at because there is so much innovation is a crisper definition of the difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is there's a lot happening on both scores just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road. As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our instruments, our LC and then our MS instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories and a more integrated view of our product portfolio. And so that's certainly feedback effort from many customers and the dialogue internally, and I think the team is making great progress. I also want to comment on TA because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products. But on the TA side, the Discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace. And while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation is going to make a big difference as well."

And really, what you refer to as a positive mix was offset by some currency headwind, as -- pretty much as we expected, but volumes and factors like absorption were very much in line.

So on the gross margin side as well as almost in every attribute, the first quarter of '15 was a little bit of 1 point off the line. I think that the 58-ish percent gross margin that we delivered in the first quarter was consistent with a full year outlook that would bring you up to 50% -- 59% for the full year with stronger gross margins anticipated in the fourth quarter."

No, thanks. I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of '15 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma but also biotech, generic, specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low to mid-single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth, which came from some of those other pools. And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification, there's also geographic diversification. For example, in the generic business, there is a very strong presence in India as well as different parts of Europe and even a visit I had in Canada, where there's a tremendous amount of innovation and growth and scale in that generics -- in the generics category and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category. So it continues to impress me, as I get out to see customers, that some of the old divisions maybe between who you'd expect to be developing small-molecule drugs and larger-molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field. The level of innovation is high. And it -- but it's a more balanced approach. So we obviously watch this closely. I'm continuing to try to get even more deeper, more granular understanding as to the dynamics and the sustainability of this market, but it does appear to be a very different market than what it's been in the past."

But at the end of the day, if the pill count is rising and the underlying operational activity is there, which it certainly is, then that's going to translate into that resiliency or that stability in the end market. Obviously, as you point out, the regulatory bar continues to rise for generic drug manufacturers, particularly those serving the United States or operating outside the United States. And some of our competitive advantages in terms of our informatics or Empower chromatography data systems, for example, and what we've been able to supplement on the service side in terms of helping companies through their growth to meet regulatory compliance has all been positive factors in our device utilization. Our market share tends to be pretty high in some of these methods and in some of these markets, and we don't take that for granted. We fight for it every day. But we continue to see this is a good opportunity for growth. And by the way, that's resulting in some very positive things for the health care system overall and greater patient access to medications and therapies. So it's a good business."

And I think, as you correctly noted, that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There'll be more material expenses, there'll be more marketing expenses associated with that. And if you do a rough calculation, you'd see that our full year EPS guide doesn't really have baked into it the 200 basis points of leverage that we delivered in the first quarter on an organic constant currency basis but much more moderate.

I mean, overall, the industrial markets -- there is pressure in these end markets, as you know, from just studying the general economy. The comps were a little tougher in the first quarter, get a little bit easier over the course of the year generally. And obviously, one of the big factors in our overall industrial outlook is the DSC and the TGA. In particular, the level of performance around sensitivity and resolution of those DSC and TGA products is going to impact a number of their end markets, particularly, for example, high-performance industrial polymer markets, aerospace, semiconductors, some of those types of markets. But I think another market that is beyond the traditional thermal analysis market in TA that's pretty interesting to us is rheology. I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market, and I'm pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rubber rheology. So TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes. And while they are obviously heavily entrenched and tied to the industrial markets, we do obviously try to subset that market effectively and make sure we're pouring resources into some of those areas that we think can give us growth."

In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.
For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.

We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.
In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges, given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.
Lastly, as you recall, in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments division.

Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.
Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. 
Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter as results largely materialized as we expected. 5% revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance, which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter were up 15%, making for a challenging base of comparison as we enter 2016.
Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring revenue products and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple-quarter trends in these key growth drivers.
Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets. The highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last 2 years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty and generic customers. 
Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S.
Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions, and the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1% with strong shipments of research LC/MS systems in China offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. 
Waters' instrument sales grew 2% weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems as well as through upgrades to existing systems. On the research mass spectrometry side, we began regular shipments of Vion IMS QTof in the quarter.
Waters' recurring revenues, a combination of service and consumables, led our product categories in the quarter, posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result and with 1 fewer selling day. Waters' service and support business grew at a 7% rate with performance geographically broad based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans. Consumables' 8% growth was largely balanced across major geographical regions with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns. In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application-specific pre-analytic kits such as the GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling and our newly released ProteinWorks kits.
Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.
In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made the decision to launch the new Discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsburgh  Conference, which had the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016.
Featuring new instruments for DSC, or differential scanning calorimetry, and TGA, or thermalgravimetric analysis (sic) [ thermogravimetric analysis ], this new product line represents a step function improvement in performance for -- in utility for TA's core business. Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks.
We expect the new Discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.
Geographically, we saw a decent balance with most -- with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets. In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth led by a low-teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by strong quarterly comparison as well as TA's Discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.
In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth, offset by lower governmental and academic shipments. 
Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate with strong demand from China and India.
Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid-teens with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.
I also continue to be impressed with the growth of our business in India, where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high-teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high single digits with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. 
I feel we're off to a good start this year with solid revenue performance against the tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers. Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continued to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation as well as our well-established share repurchase program. 
While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers as well as our expectation for an increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.
At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs. 
Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invest towards better solutions. Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on 3 continents. This process has been energizing and has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams and the growth opportunities ahead of us.
Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter while also transitioning to our new, globally integrated organizational structure. I'm very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.
Now I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales grow",853,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. 
In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08. And without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.
Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad based with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 5% while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.
Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8% with TA service revenue up 9%.
Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation, U.S. sales were up 2%, Europe also up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.
Sales of Waters products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.
 
Now I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. 
Gross margins for the quarter came in at about as expected at 57.7% with a moderate currency headwind.
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis.
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter and on a constant currency basis were up 2% primarily as a result of a weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million. And our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million.
As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. 
Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.
Now I will discuss our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. And we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about equal to sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full year negative FX dynamic.
We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million. 
We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. 
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding. 
Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40.
Looking at the second quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter. 
Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48.
And with that, I'll turn you back to Chris."

And yes, the strength of the recurring business is certainly a highlight for us and something we watch very closely. And as I said in my comments, I think it's a function of a variety of factors, including our strong position in instruments and our growing installed base, but also our ability to not only hang on to but enhance our contracted service plans. And your point on price is also correct that we do seek over time to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumables side, we are benefiting from continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries, which is a nice natural tailwind for us, in addition to some of the application-specific kits that I mentioned early, and we're very excited about GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks and other things in our pipeline. So this is a -- this has been a nice source of growth for us. It's gradually increasing as a mix of overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it. So it is a top priority for us."

As you know, measuring market share on a quarter by quarter basis in this business is a little bit challenging. And so in order to assess how we're performing competitively, I tend to look at -- I've looked at a lot of data on more of a rolling basis. And market share is critically important. We do want to win in all of our major categories. And I think looking at our growth rate in instruments, looking at our growth rate in chemistries and service and some of the different product categories, we do believe we've grown at a rate that exceeds the market. And so we do believe that in the core LC business, we are gradually picking up some market share, and that's our goal. And we need to continue to feed that with innovation, which is our primary lever. On the mass spec side, it's a little bit different by product category. While we've been under some pressure on the higher end research mass spec, we have performed in a solid way in the tandem quad business and particularly the new category of the QDa. It's been a nice gainer for us. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag there, but we continue to really focus and prioritize our execution in making sure we're maintaining and enhancing that market share position."

No, happy to address that, Isaac, thanks. Obviously, as you know, over the last 3 years, when I think of -- if I -- as I look back in the last 2 or 3 years, I think there's been good operating leverage masked by FX, of course, and the challenges we faced there. And so as we look at 2016 as a little more of a transition year as it relates to FX, we are trying to balance that growth and the investment in the portfolio, obviously, with a good top line over the last year and continuing to push the top line. We want to make sure we're feeding that growth with the right levels of investment. And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets harmonizing more to our guidance range. And we have an investment plan over the course of the year that is designed to yield some very modest leverage. Obviously, with top line performance, if top line performance, say, exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage. But obviously, over the course of time, I do feel that leverage is possible in this business based on the mix and the evolving mix of our business, particularly towards service and consumables, the fact that we operate in very attractive market segments and the opportunities for scale up and down the P&L as we grow. So that's really our approach. But overall, it is a balanced approach because, as I mentioned in my comments, feeding the growth is critical, particularly on the innovation side."

No, it is a very high priority, as I mentioned. Thanks for the question. And I'm still in my process of learning all about how we create value through that innovation process and, as I have been vocal about, remain very, very committed to our position, I believe, in the industry as the most vital organic innovator. And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company has made great strides in recent years on sort of the portfolio approach. And certainly, some of the organization evolution that I've been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio. One thing  I've tried to take a look at because there is so much innovation is a crisper definition of the difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is there's a lot happening on both scores just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road. As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our instruments, our LC and then our MS instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories and a more integrated view of our product portfolio. And so that's certainly feedback I've heard from many customers and the dialogue internally, and I think the team is making great progress. I also want to comment on TA because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products. But on the TA side, the Discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace. And while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation is going to make a big difference as well."

No, thanks. I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of '15 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma but also biotech, generic, specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low to mid-single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth, which came from some of those other pools. And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification, there's also geographic diversification. For example, in the generic business, there is a very strong presence in India as well as different parts of Europe and even a visit I had in Canada, where there's a tremendous amount of innovation and growth and scale in that generics -- in the generics category and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category. So it continues to impress me, as I get out to see customers, that some of the old divisions maybe between who you'd expect to be developing small-molecule drugs and larger-molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field. The level of innovation is high. And it -- but it's a more balanced approach. So we obviously watch this closely.

And I've certainly had the chance to learn about different facets of that, whether they're American companies participating there or Indian companies or Canadian companies, et cetera. But at the end of the day, if the pill count is rising and the underlying operational activity is there, which it certainly is, then that's going to translate into that resiliency or that stability in the end market. Obviously, as you point out, the regulatory bar continues to rise for generic drug manufacturers, particularly those serving the United States who are operating outside the United States. And some of our competitive advantages in terms of our informatics or Empower chromatography data systems, for example, and what we've been able to supplement on the service side in terms of helping companies through their growth to meet regulatory compliance has all been positive factors in our device utilization. Our market share tends to be pretty high in some of these methods and in some of these markets, and we don't take that for granted. We fight for it every day. But we continue to see this is a good opportunity for growth. And by the way, that's resulting in some very positive things for the health care system overall and greater patient access to medications and therapies. So it's a good business."

And I think, as you correctly noted, that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There'll be more material expenses, there'll be more marketing expenses associated with that. And if you do a rough calculation, you'd see that our full year EPS guide doesn't really have baked into it the 200 basis points of leverage that we delivered in the first quarter on an organic constant currency basis but much more moderate. So there is an anticipation that operating expenses will increase as we move through the year, and the basis of this increase is primarily new product launches that are planned as we move through the year."

I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market, and I'm pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rubber rheology. So TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes.

And so I think we are taking that balanced view and looking at that portfolio of end markets to converge somewhat over the course of the year."

Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. 
During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding the future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.
For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.
In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges, given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.
Lastly, as you recall, in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments division. So today on this call and into the future, we will now refer to the Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?"

Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.
Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. 
Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter as results largely materialized as we expected. 5% revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance, which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter were up 15%, making for a challenging base of comparison as we enter 2016.
Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring revenue products and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple-quarter trends in these key growth drivers.
Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets. The highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last 2 years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty and generic customers. 
Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S.
Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions, and the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1% with strong shipments of research LC/MS systems in China offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. 
Waters' instrument sales grew 2% weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems as well as through upgrades to existing systems. On the research mass spectrometry side, we began regular shipments of Vion IMS QTof in the quarter.
Waters' recurring revenues, a combination of service and consumables, led our product categories in the quarter, posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result and with 1 fewer selling day. Waters' service and support business grew at a 7% rate with performance geographically broad based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans. Consumables' 8% growth was largely balanced across major geographical regions with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns. In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application-specific pre-analytic kits such as the GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling and our newly released ProteinWorks kits.
Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.
In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made the decision to launch the new Discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsburgh Conference, which had the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016.
Featuring new instruments for DSC, or differential scanning calorimetry, and TGA, or thermalgravimetric analysis (sic) [ thermogravimetric analysis ], this new product line represents a step function improvement in performance for -- in utility for TA's core business. Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks.
We expect the new Discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.
Geographically, we saw a decent balance with most -- with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets. In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth led by a low-teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by strong quarterly comparison as well as TA's Discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.
In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth, offset by lower governmental and academic shipments. 
Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate with strong demand from China and India.
Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid-teens with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.
I also continue to be impressed with the growth of our business in India, where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high-teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high single digits with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. 
I feel we're off to a good start this year with solid revenue performance against the tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers. Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continued to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation as well as our well-established share repurchase program. 
While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers as well as our expectation for an increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.
At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs. 
Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invest towards better solutions. Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on 3 continents. This process has been energizing and has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams and the growth opportunities ahead of us.
Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter while also transitioning to our new, globally integrated organizational structure. I'm very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.
Now I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales grow",853,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. 
In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08. And without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.
Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad based with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 5% while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.
Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8% with TA service revenue up 9%.
Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation, U.S. sales were up 2%, Europe also up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.
Sales of Waters products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.
 
Now I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. 
Gross margins for the quarter came in at about as expected at 57.7% with a moderate currency headwind.
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis.
R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter and on a constant currency basis were up 2% primarily as a result of a weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million. And our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million.
As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. 
Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.
Now I will discuss our full year 2016 guidance. 
Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. And we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about equal to sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full year negative FX dynamic.
We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate.
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million. 
We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. 
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding. 
Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40.
Looking at the second quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter. 
Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48.
And with that, I'll turn you back to Chris."

And your point on price is also correct that we do seek over time to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumables side, we are benefiting from continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries, which is a nice natural tailwind for us, in addition to some of the application-specific kits that I mentioned early, and we're very excited about GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks and other things in our pipeline. So this is a -- this has been a nice source of growth for us. It's gradually increasing as a mix of overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it.

And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets harmonizing more to our guidance range.

Obviously, with top line performance, if top line performance, say, exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage.

And I think that's our continued expectation, particularly as some of the new budget gets released through the NIH funding that we've watched closely. And so we've been relatively conservative on our assumptions in the first half of the year and expect that to be more of a back half phenomenon."

No, it is a very high priority, as I mentioned. Thanks for the question. And I'm still in my process of learning all about how we create value through that innovation process and, as I have been vocal about, remain very, very committed to our position, I believe, in the industry as the most vital organic innovator. And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company has made great strides in recent years on sort of the portfolio approach. And certainly, some of the organization evolution that I've been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio. One thing I've tried to take a look at because there is so much innovation is a crisper definition of the difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is there's a lot happening on both scores just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road. As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our instruments, our LC and then our MS instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories and a more integrated view of our product portfolio. And so that's certainly feedback I've heard from many customers and the dialogue internally, and I think the team is making great progress. I also want to comment on TA because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products. But on the TA side, the Discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace. And while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation is going to make a big difference as well."

No, thanks. I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of '15 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma but also biotech, generic, specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low to mid-single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth, which came from some of those other pools. And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification, there's also geographic diversification. For example, in the generic business, there is a very strong presence in India as well as different parts of Europe and even a visit I had in Canada, where there's a tremendous amount of innovation and growth and scale in that generics -- in the generics category and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category. So it continues to impress me, as I get out to see customers, that some of the old divisions maybe between who you'd expect to be developing small-molecule drugs and larger-molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field. The level of innovation is high. And it -- but it's a more balanced approach. So we obviously watch this closely.

But at the end of the day, if the pill count is rising and the underlying operational activity is there, which it certainly is, then that's going to translate into that resiliency or that stability in the end market. Obviously, as you point out, the regulatory bar continues to rise for generic drug manufacturers, particularly those serving the United States who are operating outside the United States. And some of our competitive advantages in terms of our informatics or Empower chromatography data systems, for example, and what we've been able to supplement on the service side in terms of helping companies through their growth to meet regulatory compliance has all been positive factors in our device utilization. Our market share tends to be pretty high in some of these methods and in some of these markets, and we don't take that for granted. We fight for it every day.

And I think, as you correctly noted, that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There'll be more material expenses, there'll be more marketing expenses associated with that.

But I'm encouraged by what I see as a broader trend in pharmaceuticals towards the generic marketplace and the global nature of that, that hopefully will support continued strong growth in that segment for us."

And I really am gaining a deeper and deeper appreciation, and everything I've learned reinforces the unique position we have in the industry in terms of our focus and our record and our desire to produce industry-leading organic innovation. My first priority as I go through this is to really put a lot of definition around our core business, and job one in strategy is always to make sure you're maximizing your performance and potential in your core business. And we love our core and we'll continue to seek first to optimize that. Beyond that, it's really a matter of gaining more and more clarity on where we see the upside growth opportunities in terms of some of the growing markets, new markets and even geographic markets, and I think some of the themes we've talked about in -- even in some of these calls reinforce what those are. At the end of the day, we are taking a pretty deep and structured and thoughtful approach to this planning process, and I'm energized, the organization is energized. And what I expect to be able to report on in the future is just higher degrees of clarity on priorities around the markets, our chosen markets that we're serving, our product plan and the capabilities that we want to develop in the organization to get there.

I also see an opportunity in the triple quad business where we have a little bit of a lower share but some newer products and also some market opportunity. The growth in the quarter there was broad based, as we pointed out. Pharma in particular was strong. It had maybe a little easier comparison but had a good year-over-year growth. And the -- but the end markets there were reasonable. So Japan historically has been more of a developed market, more mid-single-digit type growth, low to mid-single-digit type growth.

I don't necessarily expect that type of growth rate to be the permanent growth rate in Japan, but we do expect to be very competitive in that market and we've got a great team there."

I mean, overall, the industrial markets -- there is pressure in these end markets, as you know, from just studying the general economy. The comps were a little tougher in the first quarter, get a little bit easier over the course of the year generally. And obviously, one of the big factors in our overall industrial outlook is the DSC and the TGA. In particular, the level of performance around sensitivity and resolution of those DSC and TGA products is going to impact a number of their end markets, particularly, for example, high-performance industrial polymer markets, aerospace, semiconductors, some of those types of markets. But I think another market that is beyond the traditional thermal analysis market in TA that's pretty interesting to us is rheology. I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market, and I'm pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rubber rheology. So TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes. And while they are obviously heavily entrenched and tied to the industrial markets, we do obviously try to subset that market effectively and make sure we're pouring resources into some of those areas that we think can give us growth."

Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.  As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary. 
I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, with revenue growth of 8% against a strong basic comparison and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported.  Revenue performance was broad-based across end markets, product lines and geographies, with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth. Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.  
Taking a closer look at our major end markets. Our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters Products once again led the way, with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows, as well as in large molecule R&D-oriented applications. Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015.
Lower growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter in the mid-single-digit rate. Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA Product category, as well as solid growth in Waters Products sold to food markets.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, waters' Instruments sales grew 7%, with positive demand for core LC and benchtop LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized in our industry-leading MPower CDS software.  We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows, and as part of this, we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.
On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest benchtop systems, including the Xevo, QT of biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding qualification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year. Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate, with balance performance geographically, associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumable sales were up 11%, with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges. Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications.  The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and at the same time, presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters support among high utilization customers as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.
Turning to our TA Instruments products, this business was yet another highlight of the quarter, with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter.  These new products are being well-received by the market.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate; European sales grew at a low double-digit rate; and Asian sales grew at a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS columns, as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.  In Europe, we also saw a strong pharmaceutical trends while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it is premature to assess the longer-term effects of the U.K.'s exit from the EU, and therefore, our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.  Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China, and this is often impressive prior years performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales.  Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter, with strong pharmaceutical sales, offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief. 
In total, our first half of 2016 was strong, with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggests the continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year.  We have also effectively managed our spending year-to-date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.  At the same time, we are investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business, as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we have embarked on a strategy development process that is providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns. To build on these strengths, and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team, as well as all of our employees throughout the world, are focused and our executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I have established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our Board of Directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"
36475,372144891,1011748,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning.  In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter",827,"Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning.  In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year.  The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06, and without this positive effect, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 8%, while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter.  Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10%, with TA service revenue up 9%. 
Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%; Europe was up 12%; Japan, up 3%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%.  Sales of Waters Products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.
Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.  Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant-currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis. This, primarily due to a weaker British pound.  On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%.  In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion, and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million.  As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program.  We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion.  Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
Now I'd like to discuss our full year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued growth in biopharmaceutical end markets, strong recurring revenue growth in relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% [ph] to 7% [ph] constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again, looking at the full year.
Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015, and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.  Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.  Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.  Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60.
Looking at the third quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about 0.05 [ph] of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. Our rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris."

The growth in pharma was pretty broad-based and broad-based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at the small molecule, large molecule, bio analysis, those type of product segments, if you will. We saw pretty reasonable growth. We saw good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan; but obviously, the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma-heavy market was solid. Our workhorse products are, as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase. And that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece. And so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D, I would say we remain consistently solid in the QA area, and that's been a strong line for some time. And it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments in the pharma market, and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them."

We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been 5 or 10 years ago. And that's been a strength. That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months in the quarter the bigger customers really come back a little bit. And get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that. And I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers and as you know, I'm out and about a lot.

And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise and was just again there a few weeks ago or earlier last week. And this Discovery series thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year, and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities. So while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business, in fact, more than half of that businesses outside the United States. And in some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continued to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us."

As you know, Europe is pharma-heavy and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there, as well as solid instrument business. And so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side. As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular. And while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the -- we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So I'd say we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience. And as it relates to the U.K., we're in a unique situation in England, as well as in Europe broadly with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region. And, by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time, depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade and barriers or trade agreements gets struck, what type of tariffs ensue. Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for sometime, probably into early to mid-2017. There's a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the U.K., and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really, it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control. As you know, it's a good end market for us in the U.K. Less than 5% but a good end market that's pretty well-balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the U.K. and in Ireland, as well as product costs. So in the near term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation, and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region not just from a commercial standpoint but also from an operational standpoint."

And I would say that we are also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side. So looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma. A little bit more conservative on the public spending and on the industrial side, although I think for TA Instruments, that would be a strong half given their new product flow. Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side. That segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic.

And I think it's interesting hypothesis in question is, is there less cyclicality, if you will, in the market now because of the increased diversity, both geographically of the customer base, the type of firms, as well as the type of molecules that are comprising the world's pharma pipeline. And so that's what we're obviously continuing to dig deep on. But maybe Gene can draw a broader historical perspective on this."

And as Chris mentioned, as we become less reliant on our top customers for a high percentage of our pharmaceutical sales, I think there's a good argument to say that the cyclicality might not have quite as much of highs and lows to it. If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia, with both China and India performing strongly. And then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we've seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front. So I think I'm just echoing pretty much what Chris mentioned, but hopefully, that's helpful."

Now I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we open to the second half. I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen, but there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting, and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX would be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us."

One of the things to consider as you begin to look at the TA business is the effect that we have, not only from this new Discovery launch, but from all of the additional technologies that TA has been adding in, in recent years. In the quarter, we just got a little bit of tailwind from M&A. Right now, our guidance assumes that most of the growth that we have from TA will be organic as we look at the second half of the year. So clearly, the markets that are most receptive to new technologies and material characterization, the more developed markets, Europe, Japan, the U.S. are the ones that are showing the greatest promise as they quickly adopt the new Discovery series.

And obviously, the first question in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business. And then obvious way, to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets. As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any, as you, biding constraints, I guess probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth. Of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits, and we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments and of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me. As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time. And over time, the company has, I think, made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined. So I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale and other big opportunities that can grow over time."

So I think we're trying to achieve as balanced as possible an overall portfolio of where our instrument platforms are used. And as we said in the call, also try to be very innovative in the example I used in the call, continuing to emphasize the use of mass detection as a supplement to traditional optical and UV detection in chromatography workflows.

In a broad sense, I would say my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mixed opportunities, absorbing our costs with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and hopefully in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D, and I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D. And so that's an area of investment that we feel we can pay for with a number of other levers over time. And to ideally achieve that optimal mix between growth and modest leverage, while continuing to invest to grow. So that's the framework, that's the ideas, and we'll put more specifics on that as we move forward."

Obviously, one of the challenges we have is where that cash is located relative to the ability to use it for kind of U.S. purposes like share repurchase. I think we have a very well-established share repurchase program. We return a significant portion of that free cash flow to shareholders. I think as a leading -- at a leading level in the industry and so really, for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue the practice, and obviously any adaptation to that over time would be carefully thought through and discussed. So the question of capital allocation's a fair question. It goes part and parcel with our strategic outlook, and as we get further down the line, we'll put more specifics on all that.  But thanks for the question. I appreciate it, and look forward to the continuing dialogue.
So with that, maybe, Liz, thanks, and I'll move to some closing comments. To close the call. So really, to conclude, as we move to the second half of the year and begin to broaden our focus to 2017 and beyond, we are encouraged as we commented today by our first half performance. We're encouraged by the  condition of our key end markets as well as by the strength of our product positions. All that said, we do live in a dynamic world and we'll continue to balance our optimism with a business plan that can adapt to unforeseen changes in market conditions so that we can continue to deliver reliable financial results.
So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 25, 2016. Thank you very much, and have a great day."

36475,372144891,1011985,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.

Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.  As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary. 
I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong basic comparison and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported.  Revenue performance was broad based across end markets, product lines and geographies with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth. Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.  
Taking a closer look at our major end markets. Our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters Products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw a solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows as well as in large molecule R&D-oriented applications. Year to date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015.
Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate. Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA Product category as well as solid growth in Waters Products sold to food markets.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instruments sales grew 7% with positive demand for core LC and benchtop LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry-leading Empower CDS software.  We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this, we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.
On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest benchtop systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year. 
Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate with balance performance geographically, associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumable sales were up 11% with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges. Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and, at the same time, presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters support among high-utilization customers as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.
Turning to our TA Instruments products. This business was yet another highlight of the quarter with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter.  These new products are being well received by the market.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew at a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. 
The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS columns as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.  
In Europe, we also saw a strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it is premature to assess the longer-term effects of the U.K.'s exit from the EU. And therefore, our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.
Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China, and this is often impressive prior years' performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales.  Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter with strong pharmaceutical sales, offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief. 
In total, our first half of 2016 was strong with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggest the continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year. We have also effectively managed our spending year-to-date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.  At the same time, we're investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we have embarked on a strategy development process that is providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I have established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our Board of Directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"
36475,372144891,1011985,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral.

The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06. And without this positive effect, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter.  Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%. 
Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%; Europe was up 12%; Japan, up 3%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%.  Sales of Waters Products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.
Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.  
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis. This is primarily due to a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion, and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program. 
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
Now I'd like to discuss our full year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued growth in biopharmaceutical end markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% to 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again, looking at the full year.
Moving down to P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.  
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.  
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.
Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60.
Looking at the third quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about 0.5 of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. 
Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris."

The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at the small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis, those type of product segments, if you will. We saw a pretty reasonable growth. We saw good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan. But obviously, the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma-heavy market, was solid. Our workhorse products are, as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase. And that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece. And so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D, I would say we remain consistently solid in the QA area, and that's been a strong line for some time. And it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which as I mentioned in the prepared comments. We hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows.

And I think we've always thought that's actually a strength because it's a broadening portfolio of customers. We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been 5 or 10 years ago. And that's been a strength. That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months in the quarter the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that. And I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers. And as you know, I'm out and about a lot. And particularly as you get into some of the larger traditional pharma companies, what I see is greater diversities within their own portfolios, chemical entities as well as biologic entities. And so I think that's what's driving it."

And I think that's very much a reflection of I'd say 2 things. First of all is the new products, the DSC and then beginning the market, the TGA, even though that hasn't launched yet. We also had an easier comparison in Q2 versus Q1 in TA Instruments. But TA has been a very solid franchise for us. And while it can be a little bit lumpy from time to time as a reflection of those types of end markets, over time, TA has provided very consistent growth in profitability and returns for the company. And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise and was just again there a few weeks ago or earlier last week. And this Discovery series, thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities. So while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business. In fact, more than half of that businesses outside the United States. And some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continued to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us."

As you know, Europe is pharma-heavy and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there as well as solid instrument business. And so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side. As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular. And while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the -- we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So I'd say we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience. And as it relates to the U.K., we're in a unique situation in England as well as in Europe broadly with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region. And by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade and barriers or trade agreements gets struck, what type of tariffs ensue. Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There's a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the U.K., and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really, it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control. As you know, it's a good end market for us in the U.K. Less than 5% but a good end market that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the U.K. and in Ireland as well as product costs. So in the near term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation. and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region, not just from a commercial standpoint but also from an operational standpoint."

I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side. So looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma and a little bit more conservative on the public spending and on the industrial side, although I think for TA Instruments, that will be a strong half given their new product flow. Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side. That segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic.

If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia, with both China and India performing strongly. And then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we have seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front.

Now I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we open to the second half. I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen. But there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting, and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us."

And certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today and start to think about a framework for the future. And one thing I remind everybody internally is, as well as I'll remind you externally, is that it's a process. It's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what make us unique and different and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice. And obviously, the first question, in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business, and then obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets. As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any, as you said, biding constraints, I guess it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments and, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me. As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time. And over time, the company has, I think, made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined. So I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale in other big opportunities that can grow over time."

In a broad sense, I would say my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mixed opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and hopefully in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D, and I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D.

I would say that the current performance is a lot more driven by the second thing you said, Amanda, in terms of kind of a gradual mix shift in our installed base towards higher utilization platforms. As you know, our ACQUITY portfolio, our UPLC platform, has a higher attach rate than our legacy HPLC systems. And so as UPLC continues to gradually grow in its presence in the marketplace, that provides us with a nice opportunity on the consumables side. I think new products like the CORTECS are still quite early in their phase of adoption. And so there's not necessarily a big tailwind that we're getting from that in the immediate time. But obviously, that type of innovation with solid core technology and the efficiency gains in -- across the number of different workflows is a really attractive offering to the market, and we expect to add to our competitive advantage. Obviously, we have a large portfolio of consumables in chromatography, and as you alluded to, an increasing presence and interest in kits like the glycan kits I referred to earlier, like ProteinWorks and some other specialty applications where we think we can do even more. So we really like this part of the business. We think we're competitively differentiated on the chemistry side with a significant chemistry expertise at our core. And we're only continuing to increase the emphasis of those development efforts."

I think that the quarters where we tend to see more of the quarter end pickup are in the first quarter when people are waiting for budgets to be released, and then in the fourth quarter when people are making sure that they use their calendar budget before the new year starts. I can tell you that last year, that fourth quarter hockey stick was just a little bit more tempered than it has been in prior years. And another dynamic is just the increasing component to our business in Asia where, just historically, this sort of ordering and selling pattern was not as pronounced as it had been in Western Europe and North America."

Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.  As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary. 
I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong basic comparison and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported.  Revenue performance was broad based across end markets, product lines and geographies with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth. Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.  
Taking a closer look at our major end markets. Our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters Products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows as well as in large molecule R&D-oriented applications. Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015.
Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate. Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA Product category as well as solid growth in Waters Products sold to food markets.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instruments sales grew 7% with positive demand for core LC and benchtop LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry-leading Empower CDS software.  We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this, we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.
On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest benchtop systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year. 
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate with balanced performance geographically, associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumable sales were up 11% with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges. Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and, at the same time, presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters support among high-utilization customers as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.
Turning to our TA Instruments products. This business was yet another highlight of the quarter with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter.  These new products are being well received by the market.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew at a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. 
The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS columns as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.  
In Europe, we also saw a strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it is premature to assess the longer-term effects of the U.K.'s exit from the EU. And therefore, our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.
Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China, and this is off an impressive prior year's performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales.  Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter with strong pharmaceutical sales, offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief. 
In total, our first half of 2016 was strong with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggests a continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year. We have also effectively managed our spending year-to-date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.  At the same time, we're investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we have embarked on a strategy development process that is providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I have established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our Board of Directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral.

The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06. And without this positive effect, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter.  Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%. 
Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%; Europe was up 12%; Japan, up 3%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%.  Sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.
Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.  
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis. This is primarily due to a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion, and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program. 
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
Now I'd like to discuss our full year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued growth in biopharmaceutical end markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% or 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again, looking at the full year.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.  
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.  
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.
Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60.
Looking at the third quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about 0.5 of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. 
Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris."

The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis, those type of product segments, if you will. We saw a pretty reasonable growth. We saw good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan. But obviously, the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma-heavy market, was solid. Our workhorse products are, as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase. And that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece. And so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D, I would say we remain consistently solid in the QA area, and that's been a strong line for some time. And it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which as I mentioned in the prepared comments. We hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments of the pharma market and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them."

And I think we've always thought that's actually a strength because it's a broadening portfolio of customers. We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been 5 or 10 years ago. And that's been a strength. That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months and in the quarter the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that. And I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers. And as you know, I'm out and about a lot. And particularly as you get into some of the larger traditional pharma companies, what I see is greater diversities within their own portfolios, chemical entities as well as biologic entities.

And I think that's very much a reflection of I'd say 2 things. First of all is the new products, the DSC and then beginning to market, the TGA, even though that hasn't launched yet. We also had an easier comparison in Q2 versus Q1 in TA Instruments. But TA has been a very solid franchise for us. And while it can be a little bit lumpy from time to time as a reflection of those types of end markets, over time, TA has provided very consistent growth in profitability and returns for the company. And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise and was just again there a few weeks ago or earlier last week. And this Discovery series, thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities. So while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business. In fact, more than half of that business is outside the United States. And some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continued to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us."

As you know, Europe is pharma-heavy and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there as well as solid instrument business. And so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side. As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular. And while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the -- we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So I'd say we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience. And as it relates to the U.K., we're in a unique situation in England as well as in Europe broadly with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region. And by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade and barriers or trade agreements gets struck, what type of tariffs ensue. Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There's a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the U.K., and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really, it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control. As you know, it's a good end market for us in the U.K. Less than 5% but a good end market that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the U.K. and in Ireland as well as product costs. So in the near term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation. and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region, not just from a commercial standpoint but also from an operational standpoint."

I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side. So looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma and a little bit more conservative on the public spending and on the industrial side, although I think for TA Instruments, that will be a strong half given their new product flow. Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side. That segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic.

And then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we have seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front.

Now I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we open to the second half. I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen. But there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting, and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line.

In the quarter, we just got a little bit of tailwind from M&A. Right now, our guidance assumes that most of the growth that we have from TA will be organic as we look at the second half of the year. So clearly, the markets that are most receptive to new technologies and material characterization, the more developed markets, Europe, Japan and the U.S. are the ones that are showing the greatest promise as they quickly adopt the new Discovery series. Was that -- does that answer your question, Steve?"

And certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today and start to think about a framework for the future. And one thing I remind everybody internally is, as well as I'll remind you externally, is that it's a process. It's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what make us unique and different and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice. And obviously, the first question, in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business, and then obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets. As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any, as you said, biding constraints, I think it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments and, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me. As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time. And over time, the company has, I think, made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined. So I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale in other big opportunities that can grow over time."

I wouldn't say there's anything out of ordinary right now in terms of where we're at. At the same time, we do look to expand our technology into new workflows earlier in the development process and geographically as more companies get in the game, particularly in some of the emerging markets. So I think we're trying to achieve as balanced as possible an overall portfolio of where our instrument platforms are used. And as we said in the call, also try to be very innovative in the example I used in the call, continuing to emphasize the use of mass detection as a supplement to traditional optical and UV detection in chromatography workflows. We think that has a lot of value to our customers, particularly in some of the more complex, larger molecule and bio type of applications. And we look forward to that playing through into more and more routine methods all the way through QC over time. And so that tends to be our focus and obviously balance our instrument business with a very sharp focus on our chemistry consumables and our service offering."

In a broad sense, I would say my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mix opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and hopefully in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D, and I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity out of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D. And so that's an area of investment that we feel we can pay for with a number of other levers over time and to ideally achieve that optimal mix between growth and modest leverage while continuing to invest to grow. So that's the framework, that's the ideas and we'll put more specifics on that as we move forward."

I would say that the current performance is a lot more driven by the second thing you said, Amanda, in terms of kind of a gradual mix shift in our installed base towards higher utilization platforms. As you know, our ACQUITY platform, or our UPLC platform, has a higher attach rate than our legacy HPLC systems. And so as UPLC continues to gradually grow in its presence in the marketplace, that provides us with a nice opportunity on the consumables side. I think new products like the CORTECS are still quite early in their phase of adoption. And so there's not necessarily a big tailwind that we're getting from that in the immediate time. But obviously, that type of innovation with solid core technology and the efficiency gains in -- across the number of different workflows is a really attractive offering to the market, and we expect to add to our competitive advantage. Obviously, we have a large portfolio of consumables in chromatography, and as you alluded to, an increasing presence and interest in kits like the glycan kits I referred to earlier, like ProteinWorks and some other specialty applications where we think we can do even more. So we really like this part of the business. We think we're competitively differentiated on the chemistry side with a significant chemistry expertise at our core.

I think that the quarters where we tend to see more of the quarter end pickup are in the first quarter when people are waiting for budgets to be released, and then in the fourth quarter when people are making sure that they use their calendar budget before the new year starts. I can tell you that last year, that fourth quarter hockey stick was just a little bit more tempered than it has been in prior years.

Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.  As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary. 
I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong basic comparison and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported.  Revenue performance was broad based across end markets, product lines and geographies with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth. Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.  
Taking a closer look at our major end markets. Our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters Products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows as well as in large molecule R&D-oriented applications. Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015.
Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate. Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA Product category as well as solid growth in Waters Products sold to food markets.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instruments sales grew 7% with positive demand for core LC and benchtop LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry-leading Empower CDS software.  We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this, we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.
On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest benchtop systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year. 
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate with balanced performance geographically, associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumable sales were up 11% with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges. Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and, at the same time, presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters support among high-utilization customers as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.
Turning to our TA Instruments products. This business was yet another highlight of the quarter with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter.  These new products are being well received by the market.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew at a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. 
The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS columns as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.  
In Europe, we also saw a strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it is premature to assess the longer-term effects of the U.K.'s exit from the EU. And therefore, our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.
Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China, and this is off an impressive prior year's performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales.  Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter with strong pharmaceutical sales, offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief. 
In total, our first half of 2016 was strong with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggests a continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year. We have also effectively managed our spending year-to-date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.  At the same time, we're investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we have embarked on a strategy development process that is providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I have established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our Board of Directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarte",825,"Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06. And without this positive effect, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter.  Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%. 
Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%; Europe was up 12%; Japan, up 3%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%.  Sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.
Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.  
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis. This is primarily due to a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion, and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program. 
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
Now I'd like to discuss our full year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued growth in biopharmaceutical end markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% or 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again, looking at the full year.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.  
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.  
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.
Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60.
Looking at the third quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about 0.5 of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. 
Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris."

The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis, those type of product segments, if you will. We saw a pretty reasonable growth. We saw good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan. But obviously, the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma-heavy market, was solid. Our workhorse products are, as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase. And that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece. And so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D, I would say we remain consistently solid in the QA area, and that's been a strong line for some time. And it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which as I mentioned in the prepared comments. We hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments of the pharma market and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them."

We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been 5 or 10 years ago. And that's been a strength. That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months and in the quarter the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that. And I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers. And as you know, I'm out and about a lot.

So we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade and barriers or trade agreements gets struck, what type of tariffs ensue. Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There's a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the U.K., and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really, it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control. As you know, it's a good end market for us in the U.K. Less than 5% but a good end market that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the U.K. and in Ireland as well as product costs. So in the near term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation. and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region, not just from a commercial standpoint but also from an operational standpoint."

I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side. So looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma and a little bit more conservative on the public spending and on the industrial side, although I think for TA Instruments, that will be a strong half given their new product flow. Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side. That segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic. So that's some color that I think might be helpful to you, Jon."

If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia, with both China and India performing strongly. And then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we have seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front. So I think I'm just echoing pretty much what Chris mentioned. But hopefully, that's helpful."

Now I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we open to the second half. I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen. But there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting, and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us."

In the quarter, we just got a little bit of tailwind from M&A. Right now, our guidance assumes that most of the growth that we have from TA will be organic as we look at the second half of the year.

And certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today and start to think about a framework for the future. And one thing I remind everybody internally is, as well as I'll remind you externally, is that it's a process. It's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what make us unique and different and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice. And obviously, the first question, in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business, and then obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets. As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any, as you said, biding constraints, I think it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments and, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me. As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time. And over time, the company has, I think, made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined. So I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale in other big opportunities that can grow over time."

In a broad sense, I would say my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mix opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and hopefully in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D, and I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity out of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D. And so that's an area of investment that we feel we can pay for with a number of other levers over time and to ideally achieve that optimal mix between growth and modest leverage while continuing to invest to grow.

We return a significant portion of that free cash flow to shareholders, I think, at the -- as a leading -- at a leading level in the industry. And so really, for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue that practice and, obviously, any adaptation to that over time would be carefully thought through and discussed.

All that said, we do live in a dynamic world and we'll continue to balance our optimism with a business plan that can adapt to unforeseen changes in market conditions, so that we can continue to deliver reliable financial results.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.
During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in part one under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. 
We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the result of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items, such as those outlined in our schedule entitled quarterly reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to third quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.
Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters Products & Markets and TA Instruments Products & Markets.

Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.
Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance, with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and generally challenging governmental and academic demand.
Earnings growth in the quarter continued to outpace our top line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.
Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions.
Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first 9 months of 2015. While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be stronger in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidenced of the steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.
Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid-single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instruments sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC/MS systems incorporating our benchtop tandem quadrupole technologies were highlights for the quarter's performance. 
Speaking of Tandem quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently Xevo TQ-XS high-performance tandem quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications, where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing smaller or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.
On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system, as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution talk measurements are enabling new research workflows.
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring renewing, service grew at an 8% rate with global demand for service plans continuing to increase. Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter, with relatively balanced retail growth.
Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC Columns continued to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regular workflows.
Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter, with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position and the current Discovery series launch and seemed to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.
In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of [indiscernible] , a developer of a unique and high-performance thermal renter metric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically. Asia continues to be our strongest region, with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter. Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines with particular strength in pharmaceuticals.
Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food and Drug Administration, which focused on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of our archived data. Our strength across LC optical and LC/MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data systems has us well-positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.
In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency, with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat.
Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging basic comparison, offset by growth of easier comps in Latin America. Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of two cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending.
Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. 
Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Stepping back, looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance, as revenues have grown 6% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%.
Revenue through the first 9 months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.
From the beginning of the year, we expected our big 3 growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service, to all be sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geographies segments have not -- have materialized somewhat differently than we expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.
Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in marketing conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. 
So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%.

In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26 compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015.
Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning. 
On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4% and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%, with the TA service revenue up 6%.
Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan's down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall with mid-single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.
Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first 3 quarters of 2015, with currency still a slight headwind.
Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis but decreased by 1% on a reported basis, this primarily due to the weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million.
As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
As we think our -- about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. We expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach [ph] 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter while we continue to fund our R&D initiatives.
Moving below the operating profit line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%. 
Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first 9 months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris."

In fact, if anything in the broader picture and you see this in headlines and in terms of what the government is interested in and a number of different funding sources there, there definitely seems to be a renaissance in medical research in other areas that will ultimately translate into spending in the academic sector. As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There's less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at that -- a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think the -- that tends to distort numbers quarter-to-quarter sometimes. So again, our outlook is, in this particular area, to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it."

So it's -- it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend, concerns about continued industrial weakness and again, as Chris so well-characterized in government and academic, it's a little bit tough to call, just given the lumpiness of it, so there's a little bit of conservatism on the capital spend that's built into the fourth quarter outlook."

We're, I'd say, midway through the early stages of launch of the Discovery series with the DSC and the TGA instruments in the market, with still several more versions to come. I would say the contribution from those particular product lines is relatively modest right now and that the situation in TA relative to the top line is more reflecting of the industrial chemical end markets and just a little bit of sluggishness in those markets right now. We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there's life in those markets, that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line gives us new capabilities, increasing pricing power, actually better margins. And so we're actually -- in the general sense, quite optimistic about the performance of TA and giving that particular product line a lot of support right now and just trying to manage our way through a little softer end market."

This team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management and so we, obviously, have the ability to manage expenses tightly while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth. And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well, SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long that I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital, organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours and so, I'm very pleased that we are able to get operating leverage primarily through the SG&A line at the same time increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline. So I think there's a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable and we want to, obviously, have the type of philosophy going forward.

Thank you very much, Chris. Hi, Doug. Looking at the gross margin, like -- in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls and you're right we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter, so that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we have a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin but is nicely accretive to the operating margin. There's been a lot of focus on devaluation of the British pound post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in this third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter, so the average rate of the pound was quite as favorable as it is today. But where we see it most dramatically is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about the -- there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So those are some of the factors that -- where currency effected P&L in the quarter."

I think we see the normal back-and-forth of some of these markets, particularly at a later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here. Certainly, from a Brexit standpoint, our business in the U.K. and Europe has been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the U.K. itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors in terms of the end customers. We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say particularly in the academic world, where we have a longer view in the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing, in the quoting, in the ordering to say that we will have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here. So again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook of those markets but really truly looking for an opportunity to do better."

And I guess my perspective, and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well, but my perspective is the pharma market we see today that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical. Potentially with less cyclicality, more balance, geographically, more balanced from an investment standpoint. I use the word earlier, in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process, and we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional large integrated biopharmaceutical companies and more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area. Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category, driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world. But on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development. And frankly, that have more challenging requirements. I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still. And many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we -- we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world in all of those vectors and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that so we're really maximizing our performance in our core business, which is our strategical #1."

I'm would say I'm still learning about the competitive landscape relative to product cycles and what they're trying to do. But frankly, I'm 100% focused on what we're trying to do and making sure we're doing the right thing for Waters. So I don't have a perfectly clairvoyant vision on your question. I'd look at what we're doing in product development and take the last 4 or 5 big products we've done, like the QDa mass detector, ACQUITY Arc, a couple of really good entrance of the mass spec category with Vion and Xevo TQ-XS in the quantification area and then the stuff on the TA side. I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments. These particular products that were newer in the market with. And keep in mind, product launches in this sector continue to impress me as things that really deepen and build and scale more steadily over time rather than being quick hits. But if you think about the key priorities around our core business in small molecules and technologies like the Arc and the advantages that gives us in a more flexible approach to methods and geographies like China. You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area. And so I think some of the products that we're emphasizing right now in our portfolio are very much of the core of the most important trends that we're trying to drive in the marketplace. And we'll, over time, give you a little more visibility into the pipeline for the future, but I've had an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about our portfolio and working with our engineering teams to make sure that what is coming next continues to build on this momentum."

I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been, in recent quarters and years, really solid in the midteens and I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of the both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there developing generic pharmaceuticals, producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world. As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing, and so we've done particularly well in that market and believe, if we build our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower, it's a huge competitive advantage for us. It's one we continue to build upon and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market. The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become, over time, a vibrant domestic market as well. And so the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India. So India is a huge priority. It's challenging to be our third largest country in the world, after the U.S. and China and will continue to be one of our top priorities."

We're not happy with the declining want to do better, we will even do better, but on the other hand, keep it in perspective and keep our #1 focus on the core business and the sectors, like pharma, like food and others that are giving us a lot of growth right now.

And I have to say that, as a higher ticket item, those tend to be lumped a little bit more towards the closing markets of the year. Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend and that was mostly represented by -- in our higher-end mass spectrometry space.

Maybe I'll start with the U.K. and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the U.K. Our U.K. business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover. So it's one of your bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced. There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also strong government and academic sector in the U.K. as well. And so that market's an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near term, don't see any impacts of Brexit. But we're very -- we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the U.K. and then there are number of times, including 2 key thought leaders in government and other sectors to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the U.K. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the U.K. is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world, and I'm actually, despite all the uncertainty, confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind, as the negotiation gets underway. So again, there's some -- much of that's out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process. From the standpoint of China, again, we don't want to get too specific other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I think that's a function of 2 or 3 things. First of all, it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of the government. We're between year 1 and year 2 of the 13th 5-year plan and we've studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government's trying to do, particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data studies there as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine. Those are 3 of our big priorities. We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing rapid adoption of some of our your technologies, like the ACQUITY Arc, that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly but also advance to more innovative up-to-date methods. And so, it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time. We're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China. We have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's the very top of our list. 
So anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now just move to conclude the call.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share through the first 3 quarters of the year. 
So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017.
And with that, I thank you, and wish you a wonderful day. Bye."

Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.
Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance, with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and generally challenging governmental and academic demand.
Earnings growth in the quarter continued to outpace our top line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.
Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way, with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions.
Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first 9 months of 2015. While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be strongest in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidence of the steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.
Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results, and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid-single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instruments sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC/MS systems incorporating our benchtop tandem quadrupole technologies were highlights of the quarter's performance. 
Speaking of tandem quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for our Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently introduced Xevo TQ-XS high-performance tandem quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications, where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing small or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.
On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system, as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution talk measurements are enabling new research workflows.
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring revenue, service grew at an 8% rate, with global demand for service plans continuing to increase. Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter, with relatively balanced regional growth.
Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC Columns continued to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regulated workflows.
Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter, with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position and the current Discovery series launch and seemed to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely, and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.
In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of Rubotherm, a developer of a unique and high-performance thermogravimetric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically. Asia continues to be our strongest region, with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter. Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines, with particularly strength in pharmaceuticals.
Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food and Drug Administration, which focused on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archived data. Our strength across LC optical and LC/MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data systems has us well positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.
In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency, with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat.
Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging basic comparison, offset by growth of easier comps in Latin America. Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of 2 cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending.
Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. 
Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand at Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Stepping back, looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance, as revenues have grown 6% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%.
Revenue through the first 9 months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage, while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.
From the beginning of the year, we expected our big 3 growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service to all these sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geography segments have not -- have materialized somewhat differently than we originally expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.
Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in marketing conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. 
So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers, and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral.Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quart",799,"Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26 compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015.
Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning. 
On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4% and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%, with TA service revenue up 6%.
Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan's down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall, with mid-single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.
Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first 3 quarters of 2015, with currency still a slight headwind.
Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis but decreased by 1% on a reported basis. This primarily, due to the weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million.
As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
As we think our -- about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. We expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter, while we continue to fund R&D initiatives.
Moving below the operating profit line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%. 
Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first 9 months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris."

And I agree with your point that we don't really see a funding problem out there. In fact, if anything in the broader picture and you see this in headlines and in terms of what the government is interested in and a number of different funding sources there. There definitely seems to be a renaissance in medical research, in other areas that will ultimately translate into spending in the academic sector. As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There's less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at the -- a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think the -- that tends to distort numbers quarter-to-quarter sometimes. So again, our outlook is, in this particular area, to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it."

And a good rule of thumb is that each day, additional day, can contribute about a percentage of growth to our recurring revenues and with recurring revenues being about half of our business that would translate into a benefit of about a percentage point of growth. So it's -- it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend, concerns about continued industrial weakness and, again, as Chris so well characterized the government and academic, it's a little bit tough to call, just given the lumpiness of it.

We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there's sign of life in those markets that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line actually gives us new capability, increasing pricing power, actually better margins.

By our estimates, the weakening of the pound may have provided a -- around 50 basis point benefit. And in spite of that gross margin decline, 10 bps year-over-year. If you could provide a little more detail there as well that would be more helpful."

We did get SG&A leverage and that's a combination of, I would say, 3 factors. Certainly, the little bit of revenue weakness lowered some of the sales type spending. Very strong operating discipline. And this team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management and so we, obviously, have the ability to manage expenses tightly, while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth. And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well, SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or even enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long as I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital, organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours and so, I'm very pleased that we're able to get operating leverage, primarily through the SG&A line and at the same time increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline. So I think there's a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable and we want to, obviously, have that type of philosophy going forward. So I'll let Gene comment a little more, specifically on the puts and takes of the gross margin."

Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, looking at the gross margin, like -- in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls and you're right that we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter, so that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we had a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin but it's nicely accretive to the operating margin. There's been a lot of focus on devaluation of the British pound, post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in these third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter. So the average rate of the pound wasn't quite as favorable as it is today. But where we see it most dramatically, is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about the -- there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So those are some of the factors that -- where currency effected our P&L in the quarter."

But in the areas that you mentioned, I think we're being quite balanced actually and cautious and conservative, and I don't think we have a feeling that there's some major cyclical trend that we're heading into. I think we see the normal back-and-forth of some of these markets, particularly, at the later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here. Certainly, from a Brexit standpoint, our business in the U.K. and in Europe has actually been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe, part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the U.K. itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors or attitudes in terms of the end customers. We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say, particularly, in the academic world, where we have a longer view in the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing, in the quoting, in the ordering to say that hopefully, we'll have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here. So again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook in those markets but really, truly looking for an opportunity to do better."

And clearly, is question of cycles and pharmaceutical and staying power of demand, as you say, is exactly the point. And I guess my perspective, and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well, but my perspective is the pharma market we see today and that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical. Potentially with less cyclicality, more balance, geographically, more balance from an end customer standpoint. I used the word earlier, renaissance, in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process, and we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional large integrated biopharmaceutical companies and more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area. Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category, driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world. But on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development and frankly that have more challenging characterization requirements. I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still. And many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we -- we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world, in all of those vectors, and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that, so we're really maximizing our performance in our core business, which is our strategic goal #1."

I guess, I've spent a lot of time studying this, this year and I think the company made a bet 5 or 7 or 8 years ago, something in that time frame, to really develop more application support for the biotech world, and we've used a couple of examples of that in terms of some of the consumables and kits but also the workflows around the mass spec product line. And I think what we're seeing is, we've seen a steadily -- steady increase in market share in the large molecule segment.

I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments. These particular products that were newer in the market with.

You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety area and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area.

I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been, in recent quarters and years, really solid in the mid-teens and I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of the -- both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there developing generic pharmaceuticals -- producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world. As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing, and so we've done particularly well in that market and believe, if we build our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower, it's a huge competitive advantage for us. It's one we continue to build upon, and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market. The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become, over time, a vibrant domestic market as well. And so the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India. So India is a huge priority.

We can do better in earlier stage development and even in the research side, and we're excited about some things we're working on to augment the strength we have on late stage development in QC and to earlier stage development in research, and we want to continue to improve in all areas. So I don't know that there's been any drastic changes in mix, I don't think so in terms of our overall business composition between those areas. But like anything, there's areas we do particularly well and areas we can improve."

So you can see how a decline in these segments affects the overall result. And so like I said, we're taking a balanced view on one hand. We're not happy with the decline and we want to do better, and we believe we will do better. But on the other hand, keeping it in perspective and keep our #1 focus on the core business and the sectors, like pharma, like food and others that are giving us a lot of growth right now. So affecting the overall geography wasn't just as simple as pharma and then academic. There's a lot of other sectors within industrial too, that as we've pointed out, have had more moderate growth, particularly in the industrial side.

And to your point, some of the positive effects of the pound on cost of goods sold are going to be dependent on just the product mix and whether or not we sell the higher volumes of high-resolution mass spectrometry systems, which are manufactured at our U.K. operation. And I have to say that, as a higher ticket item, those tend to be lumped a little bit more towards the closing months of a year. Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend, and that was mostly represented by -- in our higher-end mass spectrometry space. Looking at next year, some things to consider is that we have had historically between 10% and 15% of cost of goods sold as pound denominated.

Maybe I'll start with the U.K. and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the U.K. Our U.K. business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover. So it's one of your bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced. There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also strong government and academic sector in the U.K. as well. And so that market's an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near term, don't see any impacts of Brexit. But we're very -- we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the U.K. and been there are a number of times, including 2 key thought leaders in government and other sectors to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the U.K. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the U.K. is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world, and I'm actually, despite all the uncertainty, confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind, as the negotiation gets underway. So again, there's some -- much of that's out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process. From the standpoint of China, again, we don't want to get too specific, other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I think that's a function of 2 or 3 things. First of all, it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of the government. We're between year 1 and year 2 of the 13th 5-year plan, and we've studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government's trying to do, particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data standards there as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine. Those are 3 of our big priorities. We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing the rapid adoption of some of our newer technologies, like the ACQUITY Arc, that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly, but also advance to more innovative up-to-date methods. And so, it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is that we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time. We're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China. We have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's the very top of our list. So anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now, just move to conclude the call.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth through the first 3 quarters of the year. So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017.

Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.
Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance, with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and generally challenging governmental and academic demand.
Earnings growth in the quarter continued to outpace our top line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.
Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way, with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions.
Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first 9 months of 2015. While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be strongest in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidence of the steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.
Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results, and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid-single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instruments sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC/MS systems incorporating our benchtop tandem quadrupole technologies were highlights of the quarter's performance. 
Speaking of tandem quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for our Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently introduced Xevo TQ-XS high-performance tandem quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications, where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing small or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.
On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system, as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution talk measurements are enabling new research workflows.
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring revenue, service grew at an 8% rate, with global demand for service plans continuing to increase. Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter, with relatively balanced regional growth.
Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC Columns continued to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regulated workflows.
Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter, with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position and the current Discovery series launch and seemed to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely, and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.
In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of Rubotherm, a developer of a unique and high-performance thermogravimetric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically. Asia continues to be our strongest region, with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter. Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines, with particularly strength in pharmaceuticals.
Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food and Drug Administration, which focused on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archived data. Our strength across LC optical and LC/MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data systems has us well positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.
In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency, with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat.
Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging basic comparison, offset by growth of easier comps in Latin America. Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of 2 cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending.
Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. 
Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Stepping back and looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance, as revenues have grown 6% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%.
Revenue through the first 9 months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage, while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.
From the beginning of the year, we expected our big 3 growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service to all these sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geography segments have not -- have materialized somewhat differently than we originally expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.
Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in market conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. 
So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers, and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26 compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015.
Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning. 
On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4% and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%, with TA service revenue up 6%.
Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan's down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall, with mid-single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.
Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first 3 quarters of 2015, with currency still a slight headwind.
Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis but decreased by 1% on a reported basis. This primarily, due to the weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million.
As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
As we think our -- about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. We expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter, while we continue to fund R&D initiatives.
Moving below the operating profit line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%. 
Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first 9 months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris."

In fact, if anything in the broader picture and you see this in headlines and in terms of what the government is interested in and a number of different funding sources there, there definitely seems to be a renaissance in medical research in other areas that will ultimately translate into spending in the academic sector. As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There's less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at the -- a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think the -- that tends to distort numbers quarter-to-quarter sometimes. So again, our outlook is, in this particular area, to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it."

And a good rule of thumb is that each day -- additional day, can contribute about a percentage of growth to our recurring revenues and with recurring revenues being about half of our business that would translate into a benefit of about a percentage point of growth. So it's -- it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend, concerns about continued industrial weakness and, again, as Chris so well characterized the government and academic, it's a little bit tough to call, just given the lumpiness of it. So there's a little bit of conservatism on the capital spend that's built into the fourth quarter outlook."

I would say the contribution from those particular product lines is relatively modest right now and that the situation in TA relative to the top line is more reflecting of the industrial chemical end markets and just a little bit of sluggishness in those markets right now. We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there's sign of life in those markets that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line actually gives us new capability, increasing pricing power, actually better margins.

And this team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management and so we, obviously, have the ability to manage expenses tightly, while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth. And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well, SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or even enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long as I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital, organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours and so, I'm very pleased that we're able to get operating leverage, primarily through the SG&A line and at the same time increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline. So I think there's a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable and we want to, obviously, have that type of philosophy going forward.

Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, looking at the gross margin, like -- in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls and you're right that we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter, so that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we had a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin but it's nicely accretive to the operating margin. There's been a lot of focus on devaluation of the British pound, post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in these third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter. So the average rate of the pound wasn't quite as favorable as it is today. But where we see it most dramatically, is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about the -- there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So those are some of the factors that -- where currency effected our P&L in the quarter."

I think we see the normal back-and-forth of some of these markets, particularly, at the later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here. Certainly, from a Brexit standpoint, our business in the U.K. and in Europe has actually been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the U.K. itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors or attitudes in terms of the end customers. We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say, particularly, in the academic world, where we have a longer view in the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing, in the quoting, in the ordering to say that hopefully we'll have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here. So again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook in those markets but really, truly looking for an opportunity to do better."

Embrace your core business, love your core business and try to understand it at a deeper level. And clearly, this question of cycles and pharmaceutical and staying power of demand, as you say, is exactly the point. And I guess my perspective, and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well, but my perspective is the pharma market we see today and that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical. Potentially with less cyclicality, more balance, geographically more balance from an end customer standpoint. I used the word earlier, renaissance, in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process, and we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional large integrated biopharmaceutical companies and more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area. Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category, driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world. But on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development and frankly that have more challenging characterization requirements. I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still. And many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we -- we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world, in all of those vectors, and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that, so we're really maximizing our performance in our core business, which is our strategic goal #1."

And actually, I think large pharma's doing pretty well right now as a sector and an end market, but really a lot of the growth, as you point out, is coming from specialty, in biotech and so forth. I guess, I've spent a lot of time studying this, this year and I think the company made a bet 5 or 7 or 8 years ago, something in that time frame, to really develop more application support for the biotech world, and we've used a couple of examples of that in terms of some of the consumables and kits but also the workflows around the mass spec product line. And I think what we're seeing is, we've seen a steadily -- steady increase in market share in the large molecule segment. The large molecule segment is growing faster than the small molecule segment, in general, for the future and that's a -- it's a very, very different market. And that's what we're trying to do is really unstack the stack and understand it in more -- with more granularity, what the demands are in each of these subsets.

I look at what we're doing in product development and take the last 4 or 5 big products we've done, like the QDa mass detector, the ACQUITY Arc, a couple of really great new entrants in the mass spec category, with Vion and then Xevo TQ-XS in the quantification area and then the stuff on the TA side. I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments. These particular products that we're newer in the market with. And keep in mind, product launches in this sector continue to impress me as things that really deepen and build and scale more steadily over time rather than being quick hits. But you think about the key priorities around our core business in small molecules and technologies like the Arc and the advantages that gives us in a more flexible approach to methods in geographies like China. You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety area and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area. And so I think some of the products that we're emphasizing right now in our portfolio are very much at the core of the most important trends that we're trying to drive in the marketplace.

I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been, in recent quarters and years, really solid in the mid-teens and I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of the -- both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there developing generic pharmaceuticals -- producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world. As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing, and so we've done particularly well in that market and believe have -- we've built our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower, it's a huge competitive advantage for us. It's one we continue to build upon, and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market. The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become, over time, a vibrant domestic market as well. And so the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India. So India is a huge priority.

As I mentioned earlier, the pound devalued within the third quarter. And to your point, some of the positive effects of the pound on cost of goods sold are going to be dependent on just the product mix and whether or not we sell the higher volumes of high-resolution mass spectrometry systems, which are manufactured at our U.K. operation. And I have to say that, as a higher ticket item, those tend to be lumped a little bit more towards the closing months of a year. Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend, and that was mostly represented by -- in our higher-end mass spectrometry space. Looking at next year, some things to consider is that we have had historically between 10% and 15% of cost of goods sold as pound denominated. And probably more significantly, about 1/3 of our R&D expenses is denominated in sterling. So those are some of the opportunities that we have maybe as we begin to look out into upcoming quarters to get a little more favorable impact on our P&L."

Maybe I'll start with the U.K. and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the U.K. Our U.K. business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover. So it's one of our bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced. There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also strong government and academic sector in the U.K. as well. And so that market's an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near term, don't see any impacts of Brexit. But we're very -- we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the U.K. and been there are a number of times, including to key thought leaders in government and other sectors to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the U.K. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the U.K. is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world, and I'm actually, despite all the uncertainty, confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind, as the negotiation gets underway. So again, there's some -- much of that's out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process. From the standpoint of China, again, we don't want to get too specific, other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I think that's a function of 2 or 3 things. First of all, it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of the government. We're between year 1 and year 2 of the 13th 5-year plan, and we've studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government's trying to do, particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data standards there as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine. Those are 3 of our big priorities. We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing the rapid adoption of some of our newer technologies, like the ACQUITY Arc, that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly, but also advance to more innovative up-to-date methods. And so, it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is that we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time. We're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China. We have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's at the very top of our list. So anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now, just move to conclude the call.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth through the first 3 quarters of the year. So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017.
And with that, I thank you, and wish you a wonderful day. Bye."

Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.
Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance, with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and generally challenging governmental and academic demand.
Earnings growth in the quarter continued to outpace our top line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.
Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way, with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions.
Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first 9 months of 2015. While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be strongest in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidence of the steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.
Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results, and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid-single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instruments sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC/MS systems incorporating our benchtop tandem quadrupole technologies were highlights of the quarter's performance. 
Speaking of tandem quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for our Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently introduced Xevo TQ-XS high-performance tandem quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications, where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing small or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.
On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system, as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution talk measurements are enabling new research workflows.
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring revenue, service grew at an 8% rate, with global demand for service plans continuing to increase. Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter, with relatively balanced regional growth.
Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC Columns continued to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regulated workflows.
Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter, with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position and the current Discovery series launch and seemed to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely, and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.
In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of Rubotherm, a developer of a unique and high-performance thermogravimetric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically. Asia continues to be our strongest region, with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter. Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines, with particularly strength in pharmaceuticals.
Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food and Drug Administration, which focused on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archived data. Our strength across LC optical and LC/MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data systems has us well positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.
In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency, with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat.
Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging basic comparison, offset by growth of easier comps in Latin America. Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of 2 cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending.
Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. 
Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Stepping back and looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance, as revenues have grown 6% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%.
Revenue through the first 9 months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage, while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.
From the beginning of the year, we expected our big 3 growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service to all these sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geography segments have not -- have materialized somewhat differently than we originally expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.
Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in market conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. 
So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers, and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"

In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26 compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015.
Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning. 
On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4% and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%, with TA service revenue up 6%.
Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan's down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall, with mid-single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.
Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first 3 quarters of 2015, with currency still a slight headwind.
Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis but decreased by 1% on a reported basis. This primarily, due to the weaker British pound.
On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million.
As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.
In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
As we think our -- about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.
Moving down the P&L. We expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter, while we continue to fund R&D initiatives.
Moving below the operating profit line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%. 
Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first 9 months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris."

As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There's less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at the -- a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think the -- that tends to distort numbers quarter-to-quarter sometimes. So again, our outlook is, in this particular area, to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it."

And in terms of looking at the effects of the selling days on the fourth quarter's performance, as you know, from following this company for many years, the days typically affect our recurring revenues. And a good rule of thumb is that each day -- additional day, can contribute about a percentage of growth to our recurring revenues and with recurring revenues being about half of our business that would translate into a benefit of about a percentage point of growth. So it's -- it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend, concerns about continued industrial weakness and, again, as Chris so well characterized the government and academic, it's a little bit tough to call, just given the lumpiness of it. So there's a little bit of conservatism on the capital spend that's built into the fourth quarter outlook."

We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there's sign of life in those markets that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line actually gives us new capability, increasing pricing power, actually better margins.

And this team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management and so we, obviously, have the ability to manage expenses tightly, while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth. And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well, SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or even enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long as I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital, organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours and so, I'm very pleased that we're able to get operating leverage, primarily through the SG&A line and at the same time increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline. So I think there's a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable and we want to, obviously, have that type of philosophy going forward.

Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, looking at the gross margin, like -- in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls and you're right that we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter, so that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we had a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin but it's nicely accretive to the operating margin. There's been a lot of focus on devaluation of the British pound, post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in these third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter. So the average rate of the pound wasn't quite as favorable as it is today. But where we see it most dramatically, is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about the -- there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So those are some of the factors that -- where currency effected our P&L in the quarter."

I think we see the normal back-and-forth of some of these markets, particularly, at the later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here. Certainly, from a Brexit standpoint, our business in the U.K. and in Europe has actually been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the U.K. itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors or attitudes in terms of the end customers. We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say, particularly, in the academic world, where we have a longer view in the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing, in the quoting, in the ordering to say that hopefully we'll have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here. So again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook in those markets but really, truly looking for an opportunity to do better."

And I guess my perspective, and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well, but my perspective is the pharma market we see today and that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical. Potentially with less cyclicality, more balance, geographically more balance from an end customer standpoint. I used the word earlier, renaissance, in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process, and we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional large integrated biopharmaceutical companies and more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area. Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category, driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world. But on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development and frankly that have more challenging characterization requirements. I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still. And many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we -- we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world, in all of those vectors, and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that, so we're really maximizing our performance in our core business, which is our strategic goal #1."

But frankly, I'm 100% focused on what we're trying to do and making sure we're doing the right thing for Waters. So I don't know that I have a perfectly clairvoyant vision on your question. I look at what we're doing in product development and take the last 4 or 5 big products we've done, like the QDa mass detector, the ACQUITY Arc, a couple of really great new entrants in the mass spec category, with Vion and then Xevo TQ-XS in the quantification area and then the stuff on the TA side. I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments. These particular products that we're newer in the market with. And keep in mind, product launches in this sector continue to impress me as things that really deepen and build and scale more steadily over time rather than being quick hits. But you think about the key priorities around our core business in small molecules and technologies like the Arc and the advantages that gives us in a more flexible approach to methods in geographies like China. You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety area and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area. And so I think some of the products that we're emphasizing right now in our portfolio are very much at the core of the most important trends that we're trying to drive in the marketplace. And we'll, over time, give you a little more visibility into the pipeline for the future, but I've had an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about our portfolio and working with our engineering teams to make sure that what is coming next continues to build on this momentum."

I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been, in recent quarters and years, really solid in the mid-teens and I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of the -- both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there developing generic pharmaceuticals -- producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world. As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing, and so we've done particularly well in that market and believe have -- we've built our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower, it's a huge competitive advantage for us. It's one we continue to build upon, and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market. The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become, over time, a vibrant domestic market as well. And so the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India. So India is a huge priority. It's challenging to be our third largest country in the world, after the U.S. and China, and will continue to be one of our top priorities."

Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend, and that was mostly represented by -- in our higher-end mass spectrometry space. Looking at next year, some things to consider is that we have had historically between 10% and 15% of cost of goods sold as pound denominated.

Maybe I'll start with the U.K. and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the U.K. Our U.K. business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover. So it's one of our bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced. There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also strong government and academic sector in the U.K. as well. And so that market's an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near term, don't see any impacts of Brexit. But we're very -- we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the U.K. and been there are a number of times, including to key thought leaders in government and other sectors to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the U.K. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the U.K. is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world, and I'm actually, despite all the uncertainty, confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind, as the negotiation gets underway. So again, there's some -- much of that's out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process. From the standpoint of China, again, we don't want to get too specific, other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I think that's a function of 2 or 3 things. First of all, it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of the government. We're between year 1 and year 2 of the 13th 5-year plan, and we've studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government's trying to do, particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data standards there as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine. Those are 3 of our big priorities. We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing the rapid adoption of some of our newer technologies, like the ACQUITY Arc, that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly, but also advance to more innovative up-to-date methods. And so, it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is that we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time. We're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China. We have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's at the very top of our list. So anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now, just move to conclude the call.
As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth through the first 3 quarters of the year. So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017.

And welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.  
During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the third quarter and full year 2016. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectation, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update the predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.  In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of such items as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.  Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. 
Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments division. So on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters Products & Markets and TA Instruments Products & Markets.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?"
36475,372144891,1110922,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.

Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer.  As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary. 
I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong basic comparison and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported.  Revenue performance was broad based across end markets, product lines and geographies with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth. Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.  
Taking a closer look at our major end markets. Our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters Products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows as well as in large molecule R&D-oriented applications. Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015.
Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate. Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA Product category as well as solid growth in Waters Products sold to food markets.
Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.
Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instruments sales grew 7% with positive demand for core LC and benchtop LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry-leading Empower CDS software.  We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this, we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.
On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest benchtop systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year. 
Waters total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate with balanced performance geographically, associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumable sales were up 11% with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC Columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges. Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and, at the same time, presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters support among high-utilization customers as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.
Turning to our TA Instruments products. This business was yet another highlight of the quarter with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter.  These new products are being well received by the market.
Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew at a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. 
The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS columns as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.  
In Europe, we also saw a strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it is premature to assess the longer-term effects of the U.K.'s exit from the EU. And therefore, our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.
Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China, and this is off an impressive prior year's performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales.  Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter with strong pharmaceutical sales, offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief. 
In total, our first half of 2016 was strong with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggests a continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year. We have also effectively managed our spending year-to-date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.  At the same time, we're investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we have embarked on a strategy development process that is providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I have established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our Board of Directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?"
36475,372144891,1110922,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the second quarter, our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral.

The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06. And without this positive effect, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.
On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter.  Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%. 
Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%; Europe was up 12%; Japan, up 3%; and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%.  Sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.
Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.  
Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis. This is primarily due to a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. 
In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion, and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program. 
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.
Now I'd like to discuss our full year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued growth in biopharmaceutical end markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% or 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again, looking at the full year.
Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.  
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.  
Looking at share buybacks. We plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.
Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60.
Looking at the third quarter of 2016. We are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about 0.5 of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. 
Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris."

The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis, those type of product segments, if you will. We saw a pretty reasonable growth. We saw good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan. But obviously, the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma-heavy market, was solid. Our workhorse products are, as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase. And that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece. And so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D, I would say we remain consistently solid in the QA area, and that's been a strong line for some time. And it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which as I mentioned in the prepared comments. We hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments of the pharma market and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them."

We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been 5 or 10 years ago. And that's been a strength. That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months and in the quarter the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that. And I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers. And as you know, I'm out and about a lot. And particularly as you get into some of the larger traditional pharma companies, what I see is greater diversities within their own portfolios, chemical entities as well as biologic entities.

And I think that's very much a reflection of I'd say 2 things. First of all is the new products, the DSC and then beginning to market, the TGA, even though that hasn't launched yet. We also had an easier comparison in Q2 versus Q1 in TA Instruments. But TA has been a very solid franchise for us. And while it can be a little bit lumpy from time to time as a reflection of those types of end markets, over time, TA has provided very consistent growth in profitability and returns for the company. And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise and was just again there a few weeks ago or earlier last week. And this Discovery series, thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities. So while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business. In fact, more than half of that business is outside the United States. And some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continued to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us."

As you know, Europe is pharma-heavy and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there as well as solid instrument business. And so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side. As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular. And while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the -- we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So I'd say we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience. And as it relates to the U.K., we're in a unique situation in England as well as in Europe broadly with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region. And by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade and barriers or trade agreements gets struck, what type of tariffs ensue. Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There's a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the U.K., and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really, it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control. As you know, it's a good end market for us in the U.K. Less than 5% but a good end market that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the U.K. and in Ireland as well as product costs. So in the near term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation. and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region, not just from a commercial standpoint but also from an operational standpoint."

I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side. So looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma and a little bit more conservative on the public spending and on the industrial side, although I think for TA Instruments, that will be a strong half given their new product flow. Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side. That segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic.

If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia, with both China and India performing strongly. And then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we have seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front.

Now I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we open to the second half. I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen. But there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting, and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us."

And certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today and start to think about a framework for the future. And one thing I remind everybody internally is, as well as I'll remind you externally, is that it's a process. It's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what make us unique and different and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice. And obviously, the first question, in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business, and then obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets. As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any, as you said, biding constraints, I think it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments and, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me. As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time. And over time, the company has, I think, made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined. So I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale in other big opportunities that can grow over time."

In a broad sense, I would say my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mix opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and hopefully in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D, and I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity out of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D.

I was curious about that. And then also, I think you've talked a little bit about this, but going forward, what's the opportunity for you on the consumables side in terms of proprietary products?"

I would say that the current performance is a lot more driven by the second thing you said, Amanda, in terms of kind of a gradual mix shift in our installed base towards higher utilization platforms. As you know, our ACQUITY platform, or our UPLC platform, has a higher attach rate than our legacy HPLC systems. And so as UPLC continues to gradually grow in its presence in the marketplace, that provides us with a nice opportunity on the consumables side. I think new products like the CORTECS are still quite early in their phase of adoption. And so there's not necessarily a big tailwind that we're getting from that in the immediate time. But obviously, that type of innovation with solid core technology and the efficiency gains in -- across the number of different workflows is a really attractive offering to the market, and we expect to add to our competitive advantage. Obviously, we have a large portfolio of consumables in chromatography, and as you alluded to, an increasing presence and interest in kits like the glycan kits I referred to earlier, like ProteinWorks and some other specialty applications where we think we can do even more. So we really like this part of the business. We think we're competitively differentiated on the chemistry side with a significant chemistry expertise at our core. And we're only continuing to increase the emphasis of those development efforts."

And you know in recent quarters, we have noted that with the recurring revenue growth being so strong and with the linear type of ordering in sales patterns that you see for the recurring revenue, one of the effects there has been to take that hockey-stick dynamic that we see with capital purchases that as at the end of the quarter, and maybe make it less of a shocks curve. I think that the quarters where we tend to see more of the quarter end pickup are in the first quarter when people are waiting for budgets to be released, and then in the fourth quarter when people are making sure that they use their calendar budget before the new year starts. I can tell you that last year, that fourth quarter hockey stick was just a little bit more tempered than it has been in prior years. And another dynamic is just the increasing component of our business in Asia where, just historically, this sort of ordering and selling pattern was not as pronounced as it had been in Western Europe and North America."

Gene, just from your earlier comments regarding the movement in the yen and your exposure to the pound. I'm surprised that you're not expecting an even larger positive impact from the changes in FX given your manufacturing R&D exposure in the pound that has moved in the past 4 weeks or so. So just wondering if you could -- given that you benefited from FX by $0.06 here in the quarter, the pound really didn't move until the end of your second quarter, I would've thought that the FX impact would be even larger in the second half of the year. And then I just have one quick follow-up for Chris."

So as I begin to look at the second half of the year and look at the total effects of currencies, not only the majors, but also some of the secondary currencies, I think that envisioning that we can get some place $0.05 to $0.07 during the second half of the year on FX, if everything stays relatively constant in terms of the geographic and product distribution of our business, I think that's probably a ballpark estimate that's reasonable and assumed in the guidance that we provided."

And we will take your compliment that we are generating a lot of very strong free cash flow right now. Obviously, one of the challenges we have is where that cash is located relative to the ability to use it for kind of U.S. purposes like share repurchase. I think we have a very well-established share repurchase program. We return a significant portion of that free cash flow to shareholders, I think, at the -- as a leading -- at a leading level in the industry. And so really, for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue that practice and, obviously, any adaptation to that over time would be carefully thought through and discussed. So the question of capital allocation is a fair question. It goes part and parcel with our strategic outlook. And as we get further down the line, we'll put more specifics on all that.  But thanks for the question. I appreciate it, and look forward to the continuing dialogue.
So with that, maybe, Liz, thanks. And I'll move to some closing comments to close the call. So really to conclude, as we move into the second half of the year and begin to broaden our focus to 2017 and beyond, we are encouraged, as we commented today, by our first half performance. We're encouraged by the condition of our key end markets as well as by the strength of our product positions. All that said, we do live in a dynamic world and we'll continue to balance our optimism with a business plan that can adapt to unforeseen changes in market conditions, so that we can continue to deliver reliable financial results.

We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 25, 2016. Thank you very much, and have a great day."
