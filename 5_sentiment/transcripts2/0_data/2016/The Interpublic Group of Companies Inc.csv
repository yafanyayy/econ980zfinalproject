As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report a very strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights: Organic revenue growth was 5.2% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 6.1% for the full year. 
In 2015, we grew organically in every major region of the world and across nearly all major agencies and client sectors. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 120 basis points, marking our highest Q4 margin in at least a decade. 
Full year operating margin was 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2014, which is at the high end of the range we targeted coming into the year. Operating profit increased 11% for the full year. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year was up 23% to $1.21 from $0.98 in 2014. That excludes a loss of $0.12 per share this year, largely noncash due to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses in the third and fourth quarters. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.66, excluding a loss of $0.03 per share from business dispositions. 
Over the last 2 years in a very fast-changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 12%, which is outstanding compared to our principal peers. 
During that 2-year span, we have also increased operating profit by 32% and comparable diluted EPS by 55%. All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent, the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients will drive such terrific results in the marketplace. We thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.2%. Currency had a negative 5.5% impact on revenue, while net business dispositions were negative 20 basis points. We posted notably strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pac, U.K. and LatAm. Continental Europe remain challenged although the the region did show modest organic growth in the full year. 
Our Q4 growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media, public relations. We continue to have specially strong performance from the digital services embedded across the portfolio as well as growth at digital specialists, R/GA, Huge and MRM McCann. 
At the agency level, a wide range of our portfolio contributed to growth, led by McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were tech and telecom, health care and financial services. 
New business was another highlight of the quarter. In media, we were pleased to add Johnson & Johnson's global buying and planning to the roster of 2015 media wins that includes U.S. responsibilities for J&J, Coca-Cola and CVS. 
Creative wins in the quarter included Verizon Wireless, MGM Resorts, Aldi North and Bank of America's retail business. 
As a result, our net new business was positive in Q4 as it has been through the year. 
Operating expenses were again well-managed. Underneath organic growth of 5.2% in the quarter, our organic operating increase was 3.1%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. 
For the full year, operating margin expansion of 100 basis points reflects leverage on both our salaries and related in our office and general expenses. 
During Q4, we repurchased 5 million shares, using $113 million. For the full year, we utilized $285 million for the repurchase of 14 million shares and our year-end share count eligible by dilution decreased 3% compared to 2014.  This activity builds on a sustained capital return program that we initiated in 2011. Since that time, we've returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase, and we reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by over 25%. 
In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we have announced this morning our Board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.15 per share. This marks our third consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increases of 25% or more. 
We also announced that our Board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with $159 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $459 million. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial and operational strength of IPG as well as our future prospects. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. It's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at a high level, and we remain committed to a disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value. 
As you can see in our results today, the tone of business remains solid through year-end in most major world regions, and we all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic everyday due to the pace of technological innovation and shifting consumer behavior. This represents further opportunity for our company as well as our industry. 
Given the strength as well as the overall strength of our offerings, we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth. 
There are, however, factors that require us to temper our outlook. Of course, our industry-leading results the past 2 years sets a high bar for comparable performance in 2016. Moreover, in certain markets, macro conditions present uncertainties and even headwinds. This is true most clearly in Brazil but also with respect to markets such as Continental Europe and the Middle East. 
There's is also concern for slowing in China. The currency environment remains volatile, which could have negative effects on clients spending. We've said since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, the uncertainty we're well experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution. 
Notwithstanding this environment for 2016, we are currently targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Net acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth in the year. 
It's worth noting that at current FX rates, the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses is expected to be approximately negative 2.5% for the full year. 
Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build in our record operating margin expansion. We are, therefore, targeting an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement in 2016, which would bring us to at least 12%, closer to our objective of 13% operating margin or better. 
As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective when we report back to you during our quarterly calls. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details in our results."
108616,321989989,932758,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2% and international organic growth",1904,"Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2% and international organic growth was 4.1% with all major regions, except Continental Europe, which decreased only slightly. 
For the full year, all regions were up organically. Organic growth was 6.1%. Q4 operating margin was 20.8% compared with 19.6% a year ago. 
For the full year, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 11.5% and operating profit increased 11%. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.63 and was $0.66, excluding expense of $0.03 per share for business dispositions, which is reflected pretax in our other expense line. 
Full year diluted EPS was $1.09 per share and would have been $1.21 per share, excluding business dispositions expense in Q3 and Q4, which were largely noncash. 
We purchased 14 million shares for $285 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our Board has, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.15 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue expense in detail in slides that follow. Here, it's worth noting a few below-the-line items. The $12 million of expense for the dispositions of a few nonstrategic agency offices is reflected in our other expense line, below operating income. Our effective tax rate adjusted for the dispositions was 33.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% for the full year, which compares favorably to last year's adjusted tax rate. Our tax rate has been volatile from year-to-year given our operations in over 100 countries, our utilization of loss carry forwards and the requirements of a regular adjusting valuation allowances. 
In 2015, our effective tax rate benefit from the implementation of framed strategies and from the net reversal of small tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter. We expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 37% to 39% in 2016. 
It's also worth noting that our cash tax rate in 2015 was 29%. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.2 billion compared to Q4 '14, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 5.5%, while net dispositions were negative 20 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 5.2%. 
For the full year, the strength of the U.S. dollar continue to have a significant translation impact on reported revenues and operating expenses in all international regions. Revenue growth for 2015 was therefore 1%, consisting of 6.1% organic growth and a positive 30 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 5.4%. 
It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $25 million organically in 2015 compared to 2014, which was an impact of 30 basis points in organic growth. Lower pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar, however, by lower O&G expense. 
We anticipate a similar negative pass through impact of 30 to 50 basis points in total organic growth in 2016, which is reflected in the growth targets Michael shared earlier. 
On the bottom portion of the slide, Q4 revenue growth balance between our IAN and CMG segments, which had growth of 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. 
For the full year, organic growth at IAN was a robust 6.7%. At CMG, organic growth was 3.6% for the year with the important qualifier that this is where we see a disproportionately large impact from decreasing pass-through revenue on the smaller of the 2 segments. Underlying growth at CMG was high single digit percent. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 6.2%, driven by growth in existing clients and net new business. We were led by our largest fully integrated networks, McCann and FCB as well as by Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge. We had strong performance for PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin, among client sectors, tech and telecom and health care continue to be growth leaders. 
For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 6.8% with increases across all major disciplines for sector leadership from tech and telecom and health care. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 7% organically in Q4. We continue to see solid performance from McCann and FCB and had notable growth at Jack Morton. The U.K. organic growth was 6.6% for the full year. 
In Continental Europe, the environment for growth continue to be challenging and our agencies revenue change in the quarter was negative 80 basis points. 
In our largest markets, we had moderate growth in Germany that was offset by decreases in France, Spain and Italy. 
For the full year, organic growth for Continental Europe was a positive 1.4%. 
Overall, the continent represented 9% of our 2015 revenue mix. 
In Asia Pacific, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 7.9% in Q4. That was on top of 13% growth the year ago. 
Among our largest national markets, we had solid increases to India, Australia and China. We had growth across most of our agencies, including Mediabrands, McCann, Mullen Lowe, Weber Shandwick and R/GA. 
For the year, organic growth in the region is 8.3%, paced by double-digit growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
In LatAm, we grew 5.5% organically in the quarter on top of 11% growth a year ago. 
We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, along with a slight decrease in Brazil due to continued macro headwinds.  Our growth in the regions led by McCann, Huge and R/GA.  For the year, organic growth was 4.7%. 
In our Other Markets group, revenue increased 60 basis points organically on top of 12% organic growth in Q4 '14. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. 
For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, with strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.1% for calendar 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, the organic increase in our operating expenses was 3.1% compared with 5.2% organic revenue growth. Salaries and related expense decreased to 56.2% for the fourth quarter revenue compared with 57.4% a year ago. That was mainly due to lower incentive and other performance-based expenses in the quarter. Incentive expenses were accrued at a higher-level over the first 9 months this year compared to 2014 due to strong operating performance throughout the year. 
Base payroll, benefits and tax increased as a percentage of revenue in Q4 mainly due to the impact of currency changes. 
Ops and general expenses were 23% of fourth quarter revenue this year, the same level as last year. 
For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.8% on an organic basis compared to organic revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Looking at the sources of operating leverage for the full year. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue improved 20 basis points to 63.8% from 64% in 2014. 
Underneath that, base payroll, benefits and tax expenses is 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.6% a year ago, but it is worth noting this ratio would have improved by 20 basis points if not for the decrease in our pass-through revenue, which is offset in our O&G expenses. 
Expense for temporary labor was 3.6% of revenue for the full year in 2015 compared to 3.8% a year ago. 
Incentive expenses were 3.7% of revenue for the full year compared to 3.5% in 2014, reflecting strong performance against our financial targets, almost entirely in our long-term incentive programs. 
Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2015, the same level as a year ago. Our salary -- our other salaries are related categories is 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.2% in 2014. 
Year-end headcount was approximately 49,000, an increase of 3.6%. The increases were due to higher growth areas of our portfolio, including McCann, Mediabrands, public relations and for digital talent, notably supported new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expenses for the full year. O&G was 24.7% of revenue compared to 25.6% for 2014. We had operating leverage on nearly all of our O&G categories as our real estate purchasing shared service and IT teams continue to drive significant efficiencies.  That includes 40 basis points in occupancy, 10 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 50 basis points in all other O&G, which includes the benefits of lower pass-throughs. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects with the most recent data point of 11.5%, we have come along way. There's still work to be done, and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on the impact of business dispositions on our diluted earnings per share. As shown here, our loss on sales of businesses was $12 million in Q4 and with minimal tax benefit, resulting in a loss of $0.03 per diluted share. 
For the full year, at right, the expense of our business sale is $50 million before tax with again only a small tax shield. Result was a loss of $0.12 per diluted share for the year. 
In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison is $1.21 per share for this year and $0.98 per share for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.51 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.67 billion a year ago. We returned $481 million to shareholders during the year through our share repurchase in common stock dividends. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2015 was $674 million compared with $670 million a year ago. That includes $180 million used working capital compared with $131 million a year ago. Our investing activities used $2 million to $3 million in the year, including $161 million for CapEx and $29 million for acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can choose between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $473 million in 2015, mainly $285 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $196 million in common stock dividends. 
In 2015, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $158 million. 
Slide 12 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 billion in 2007 to our current debt level of $1.76 billion at the end of 2015. 
Slide 13 shows the total of our average basic less dilutive shares overtime and at the far right, the total as of year-end 2015. This has been the area of substantial progress with average dollar shares decreasing by 125 million shares over the time period. Our starting position for 2016 is $409 million on the right. 
In summary, on Slide 14, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline and our balance sheet continues to be a source of value-creation as evidently announced by our Board today. That leads is well-positioned in entering 2016. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

It is full year report, which is why this is the time of the year where we really provide some more details, so please bear with us. I hope you'll see some of the important ins and outs in our performance for 2015. 
But from every perspective, 2015 was a very successful year with source accomplished significant milestones in terms of our performance in the marketplace as well as our financial results. 
We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our offerings with particular emphasis on our creative and digital capabilities. We further strengthened our position as the destination of choice for the industry's top talent. 
One key element of our talent strategy is a long-standing successful commitment to diversity and inclusion. We reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to diversity objectives. 
We began our formal program a decade ago. Since then, we've seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce, an environment that encourage respect and trust is key to accrete the business like ours and competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. 
The quality of our people in our work help us deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth, and we further enhanced operating margin by 100 basis points. 
We also continued to strengthen our capital structure, achieve investment-grade status from all the major credit agencies and build on our strong shareholder return programs. 
Highlights of our performance include continued progress in McCann Worldgroup and share growth at CMG as well as outstanding performance from Mediabrands in the midst of a historically unprecedented number of media count reviews. 
R/GA delivered its strongest financial and reputational year ever. FCB continued in the successful implementation of its turnaround plan. We, once again, saw dynamic growth from our digital special agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across our portfolio. 
The quality of our offerings is at its highest level in well over a decade. This was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio. We, once again, led all holding companies in AdAge A-List honors with R/GA, McCann and Deutsche on this prestigious list and UM chosen as Media Agency of the Year, a designation that we also won from Adweek. 
Of course, every marketing discipline we posted exceptional performance in the industry's most important competitions that award creativity and marketing effectiveness. Fiber Shandwick and Golin won numerous PR Agency of the Year honors. Our health care agencies dominated the medical marketing and media awards. At Cannes, R/GA was named Agency of the Year and the marketing agency brought home the Grand Prix in the film category. 
In terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG agencies performance in FC awards globally led the industry, with Mullen Lowe taking both the grand FC and winning Agency of the Year. 
Importantly, the effective as of our agencies was equally apparent and consistently strong new business performance throughout the year. 
During 2015, McCann posted strong growth across a range of its agencies and further improve this creative. Management continues to build and the level of collaboration and cross-selling within Worldgroup as well as the strong the digital and accountability offerings at MRM. 
The agency also strengthened its already powerful position in key markets such as India, China and Brazil. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relations agencies, Weber and Golin, continue to bring market share, driven by growth from their largest clients and best-in-class digital and content market capabilities, where both firms of established positions at the forefront of their field. 
Octagon and Jack Morton remain leaders in their respective disciplines. Mediabrands was also a top tier performance with very strong performance in the media reviews that dominated the headlines in 2015. 
Having already won the U.S. J&J Coke and CVS assignments, UM closed the year by prevailing in the global J&J consolidation and added a solid showing in the Sony review in the early 2016. 
The organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data capabilities are playing a key role in Mediabrands success. 
R/GA had an outstanding year, which featured strong growth as well as creative work that is recognized across all-digital media and increasingly, a traditional talent as well. The agency is also a leader in terms of innovation, not only in the agencies offerings, but also with accelerator programs where we incubate start-ups and share learnings with many other major clients. 
Positive momentum at FCB continue as the agency secured new assignments from leading advertisers such as InBev, Coca-Cola, Kia-Chrysler. At Hann, FCB had its best performance ever in the arrival of a tremendously talented new global creative leader and take the quality of the agencies product to an even greater height. 
FCB Health care offering was, once again, a top performer in its space. Mullen Lowe continue to progress. Their position as a nimble global network with a strong creative culture in contemporary hyper bundled approach is being well-received in the marketplace. The global leadership team is aligned and energized. 
We are also seeing the benefits from the integration of Profero as the group's digital partner, especially in key markets such as the U.S., U.K. and China. 
Our focus on open architecture solutions, which combined the best of our talent from across the organization was, once again, a meaningful contributor to our results. Many multiagency opportunities came into the group, domestically and internationally. The largest of these included the year's most significant holding company review in Latin America, LatAm Airlines, which we are now serving in over 20 countries as well as J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which further underscores the value that our custom-built WX unit delivers for this important client. And we continue to improve our delivery of integrated, multiagency solutions for existing multinationals. 
Overall, our strong performance in 2015 reflects a series of long-term strategic decisions backed with significant investment over time. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, the open architecture model that I just discussed as well as embedding digital experience into all our agencies. 
Our commitment to developing new skills, products and services and incorporating technology in all of our offerings has allowed us to stay highly relevant in the digital world. 
For the year, we also saw our continued progress related to the operating and financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements and profitability keep us on track to retrieving our long-term goal. 
Many initiatives are fueling the strong profitability trajectory that Frank shared with you. Among them are our performance incentives put in place that are driving continued focus on leveraging our investment in base payroll and temporary labor. 
On the real estate front, our measure of square-foot per employee decreased again in 2015 by approximately 3% to 202 square feet, down from over 240 square feet a few years ago. 
In the back-office, over 75% of global revenue is now on an SAP platform, most of which is supported by our shared services. This included 2005 editions in India, China and the U.S., with plans to add our agencies in Australia and Brazil in 2016. 
Our return of capital programs also continued to positively impact results, and we've put approximately $2.5 billion to its total shareholder returns since 2011.  The point in which we reinstituted these programs. 
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on these robust capital return programs. The latter is evident in our board's actions announced today with our dividend increase by 25% and provided for current authorization of approximately $460 million of share repurchase. 
We are well-positioned as we move into 2016. As you've heard me say before, complexity is good because the value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant to clients as they seek to navigate a dynamic media and marketing landscape. 
The general tone of the business remains solid. Yet as we've seen since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets, and we will closely monitor the impact it has on consumer sentiment. We are, therefore, approaching the year with appropriate degree of caution. Therefore for 2016, we are targeting 3% to 4% organic growth, an improvement of margin of 50 basis points and more. 
Coupled with our continued commitment to capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. 
We thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call. 
At this point, I'll open it up for questions."

If you look at how we finished the fourth quarter, the tone of our business was solid. That said, as we look into 2016,",561,"Look, I don't think there's any question that there is a pillar to be a disconnect between what's happening in the market and business. If you look at how we finished the fourth quarter, the tone of our business was solid. That said, as we look into 2016, everyone on a global basis is watching this very carefully and our concern about the future direction of the global economy. Our business is subject to changes in macroeconomics, and that's why we put a tone of caution in terms of our forecast for 2016. 
That said, we haven't seen major pullbacks by our clients. We do our budgeting on a 0 up basis. We take all of our agencies, they look at their business -- book of business, they look at what they anticipate based on conversations with our clients, they put some levels of caution in those numbers, they also put some levels of optimism in terms of to be generated revenue. It's not an exact science, which is why if you look at 2015, we started the year fairly conservative. And as we went through the year, we upped our guidance and we expanded and that our margin expectations. But the tone right now is okay and particularly if you look at 59% of our businesses in the United States and although we don't see high expectations in terms of growth, 3% to 4% growth in the United States enables us to expand margin by at least 50 basis points. And to answer your other question gives us a conversion around close to 30%, which is what we've always said. And if you expand the organic growth, that's where you see expansion of all the 50 basis points. So the tone of the business at least right now is consistent. But again, given this volatility, it's something that we have to put some element of caution out there, and I think it will be irresponsible for us not to have done that. And certainly, you're seeing that by your competitors in terms of the numbers that shown. Let me just comment, Frank mentioned it. We do build in 3% to 4% some element of our pass-through in that guidance. So if you assume the 30 to 50 basis point reduction in the pass-throughs, effectively, that organic number is 3.5 to 4.5. And let me just add that, that pass-through is a direct pass-through. It's not us taking positions with respect to digital inventory, which I'm sure will be another question. As far as the headwinds and tailwinds, we had some great wins on the media side. We did have some losses. There is a change in the tone of our business, and that is because of significant part of our business growth is coming from digital. Digital business tends to be much more project-oriented. And as a result, some projects that we were able to delivery in 2015 were not sure of repeating in 2016. So with respect to tailwinds, the tailwinds are in specific as we've said going into 2015. That said, we do have tailwinds, but I wouldn't equate them to as high a number as we had in 2015. But the other side of it given our performance on the digital side, we believe our offerings are so strong that we'll see project-based business continue in 2016."

We do stuff our NOL in the U.S, which is why the cash taxes have gone up. We still have over $1 billion of NOLs, but that's principally over in Europe, which we can't use until those earnings take effect. So we did see some benefit there. But basically, our cash taxes are in the 29% range right now. Yes, I think it's different. Look, first of all, let me talk about the U.K. I think what we have seen -- if you compare it to 2 years ago, a turnaround in the U.K. So we're forecasting it as a performance this year was 7% to 8%, and we see a solid year for the U.K. as well going into 2016. So I think that's -- and that's a big -- it's 9% of our business, and so therefore, that's encouraging for us going into 2016. I think Continental Europe, anecdotally, seems to be better, but I haven't met anyone who isn't concerned about Continental Europe. I was Davos. The conversations continue to be concerned with the financial institutions in Europe, in particular, and I think that uncertainty drives our clients to be concerned. That said, it's a global economy and there's no question that our multinational clients are looking for growth markets, India, China, Latin America, frankly United States, we're seeing good pickup in the United States. And I think that's a little bit different than it was a couple of years ago. So there's no question that this volatility in the financial markets and in the financial institutions is giving everyone a lot of angst in terms of, whether it be access to liquidity, whether affecting the capital markets. And if I were running one of those companies, I would be looking hard at our spend, which puts an additional burden on what we have to do. I think -- they're not stopping spending, they're just being very careful in terms of where they spent, and that was the burden on us to prove that what we do actually works. And if we can put together a fully integrated offering that shows how we can move the needle, it's innovative, we save some money in the process, we're effective, we held accountable for the performance of that, then I think our clients have the money to spend, and they will do that. But they do have an element of caution in that, which is why we still early in the year and a lot of things are happening. And let's face it, we have issues with oil and who knows what's going to happen with the price of oil and those kind of things. So there is caution out there. But what's amazing is our business, as I said, we're not expecting a 6% growth again, we're expecting -- we're forecasting 3% to 4%. And if we delivered 3% to 4%, we're going to expand margin by a healthy 50 basis points or better. And I think that's a reasonable way to go into 2016. I'm not trying to be a Debbie downer here, but I'm just trying to be cautious in terms of what may be ahead of us. And if we're wrong, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there."

Remember, the PR business has changed dramatically, okay? What's happening is all our different disciplines are all covering all aspects of the marketplace. Digital capability, social networking, social media, content, all of that is part of what we're seeing across-the-board in both digital and PR agencies and our traditional agencies. And as a result, Weber Shandwick, in particular, was a leader in terms of looking at their portfolio and converting to the digital and social environment. And as a result, we've seen them taking market share out there it's because of their content and new thinking in terms of PR. So we're encouraged by that.

And looking at the rest of the portfolio, our sports business, in Octagon, our experiential business, Jack Morton, very, very strong. And the CMG segment does get impacted by a decline in pass-throughs, and that's intentional. We've been trying to migrate our contracts away from being a principal, specifically, our experiential business to an agent. So when you look at on a net revenue base, our growth has been high single digits for the past 3 years. So those businesses are very, very healthy, and it's nice and our branding business of FutureBrand had, again, a very strong year. So we're very supported of that segment. We'll continue to invest."

And so when we put together open architecture, whether it's a Golin, whether it's Octagon, whether it's Weber Shandwick, we bring them into the open architecture model. So when we're sitting at the table and presenting the best of RPG to our clients, it includes a full array of our businesses so our marketing services, our traditional agency businesses, our digital capabilities and our media. They're all sitting at the table and frankly, that's what clients want to see. And the collaboration is critical to that, which is why we spend so much time on collaboration within IPG. And this open architecture model actually works. And even on -- when we just looking at media pitches, we bring in the open architecture on media. We have different disciplines, digital experiential, all of that comes to play in these pitches. And frankly, I'm a firm believer that's one of the reasons we've been successful in the new business arena because I've heard a number of clients say to me when we walk out of the room that was refreshing is that they didn't know, which individuals was from which discipline and the team really spoke as one voice, and they were focusing on clients. And then that's makes a big difference of the clients because they don't have to worry about our silos and our issues, they're just interested in servicing their clients. And if we didn't have the marketing service arm that we have at CMG and the media and the digital capabilities and the creative capabilities our agencies, we wouldn't be able to do that.

So I can't tell you how many favorable e-mails I receive for both clients as well as individuals on that move, so we're really excited about it. Marketing services, as I said, it fits very nicely into the open architecture model. I don't believe we have to own various data sources and so on when we can rent them, but that said, we did a data analytics acquisition in Israel this year. Mediabrands have their own data sources, and when they need to use that 80 or 100 different data sources. So as long as there is partnering out there where we can rent it, we think we have to do it, we have a sufficient amount of analytics and data to make our offerings competitive, if not better, and we don't have to own it. But when there are unique opportunities out there, we make some tactical investments in it. We did it in a little -- in Samba TV, we did it in Keith. So we look at it both ways. The key to this in the open architecture is having a vehicle without having to restructure our corporation to collaborate. And since we've been doing it for 10 years, we didn't need to restructure our entire company. We have high-priority objectives for all of our CEOs that require them to collaborate, both within their networks as well as outside.

That said, every once in a while, we are opportunistic. You saw we a little overweighted in the fourth quarter when we saw some price pressure on our stock. So we have the flexibility. But for analytics point, I get to use $300 million, I think that's a reasonable number for us to spend and we'll be opportunistic and see how the marketplace goes. This is part of a long-term strategy. We believe that given our leverage, obviously, bringing our ratings up one more notch would be very helpful to us in that it will give us free commercial paper program, which could help us in terms of cyclicality of our cash flows and that could free us some additional cash as well. So from an overall program point of view, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and where we are. We hope to have a commercial paper program if we get one more notch up. We have a robust return of capital on buybacks and 25% increase in dividend. It's a very nice mix between dividends and buybacks. So our overall structure in terms of return has been very well received by the investors before year-end, between Frank and myself and Jerry, we've met with most of our shareholders and this is based on the input we're getting from all of our shareholders. And as far as our leverage, we're very comfortable, and we want to be where we are heading into a market that is as volatile or potentially volatile as it is right now."

There aren't many companies that has the capabilities we have both in terms of typical advertising role, media planning, content distribution, digital expertise, insights, all of that put together and frankly, what we do actually works, and we have data, and we have also information that shows that if we can bring all of these offerings together, we can, in, fact help our clients move the needle. And it's refreshing to be able to walk into a room and put together some new ideas from a business context. And you're right, it's not just traditional advertising, it's looking in the future. We can anticipate where consumers are going to be spending their money. And based on those insights, we can help our clients realtime look at where they can allocate their dollars. And if it's not working, we can shift with them. We can create dashboards with our clients, we can help them do design work, we can do branding for them. It really turns out to be a full-service offering that we can tap into, and it gives them a degree of comfort that they're getting cutting-edge insights without having to add 12 different disciplines coming in the room working together. So I do believe -- and of course, we do consulting. I mean, some already have a consulting basis on to it. So yes, our business is changing and frankly, that's why I'm bullish on our industry. For years, they've talked about our industry being dis-intermediated, going away. We always find a way to sustain ourselves. And I think if you look at our results, you have a pretty good indication that we're capable of doing that. So yes, I thank you for that question. With that said, I think those are our last question.

As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report a very strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights: Organic revenue growth was 5.2% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 6.1% for the full year. In 2015, we grew organically in every major region of the world and across nearly all major agencies and client sectors. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 120 basis points, marking our highest Q4 margin in at least a decade. Full year operating margin was 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2014, which is at the high end of the range we targeted coming into the year. Operating profit increased 11% for the full year. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year was up 23% to $1.21 from $0.98 in 2014. That excludes a loss of $0.12 per share this year, largely noncash due to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses in the third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.66, excluding a loss of $0.03 per share from business dispositions. 
Over the last 2 years in a very fast-changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 12%, which is outstanding compared to our principal peers. During that 2-year span, we have also increased operating profit by 32% and comparable diluted EPS by 55%. All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent, the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients what drives such terrific results in the marketplace. We thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.2%. Currency had a negative 5.5% impact on revenue, while net business dispositions were negative 20 basis points. We posted notably strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pac, U.K. and LatAm. Continental Europe remain challenged, although the region did show modest organic growth for the full year. 
Our Q4 growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media, public relations. We continue to have specially strong performance from the digital services embedded across the portfolio as well as growth at digital specialists, R/GA, Huge and MRM//McCann. 
At the agency level, a wide range of our portfolio contributed to growth, led by McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were tech and telecom, health care and financial services. 
New business was another highlight of the quarter. In media, we were pleased to add Johnson & Johnson's global buying and planning to the roster of 2015 media wins that includes U.S. responsibilities for J&J, Coca-Cola and CVS. Creative wins in the quarter included Verizon Wireless, MGM Resorts, ALDI Nord and Bank of America's retail business. As a result, our net new business was positive in Q4, as it has been through the year. 
Operating expenses were again well managed. Underneath organic growth of 5.2% in the quarter, our organic operating expense increase was 3.1%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, operating margin expansion of 100 basis points reflects leverage on both our salaries and related and our office and general expenses. 
During Q4, we repurchased 5 million shares using $113 million. For the full year, we utilized $285 million for the repurchase of 14 million shares and our year-end share count eligible for dilution decreased 3% compared to 2014. This activity builds on a sustained capital return program that we initiated in 2011. Since that time, we've returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase, and we reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by over 25%. 
In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we have announced this morning our board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.15 per share. This marks our third consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increases of 25% or more. 
We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with $159 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $459 million. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial and operational strength of IPG as well as our future prospects. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. It's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at a high level, and we remain committed to a disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value. 
As you can see in our results today, the tone of the business remains solid through year-end in most major world regions, and we all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic every day due to the pace of technological innovation and shifting consumer behavior. This represents further opportunity for our company as well as our industry. Given these trends as well as the overall strength of our offerings, we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth. 
There are, however, factors that require us to temper our outlook. Of course, our industry-leading results for the past 2 years sets a high bar for comparable performance in 2016. Moreover, in certain markets, macro conditions present uncertainties and even headwinds. This is true most clearly in Brazil but also with respect to markets such as Continental Europe and the Middle East. 
There is also a concern for slowing in China. The currency environment remains volatile, which could have negative effects on clients spending. As we said since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, the uncertainty we're all experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution. 
Notwithstanding this environment, for 2016, we are currently targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Net acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth in the year. It's worth noting that at current FX rates, the currency impact to our top line as well as to our operating expenses is expected to be approximately negative 2.5% for the full year. 
Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on our record operating margin expansion. We are, therefore, targeting an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement in 2016, which would bring us to at least 12%, closer to our objective of 13% operating margin or better. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective when we report back to you during our quarterly calls. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on our results."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2% and international organic growth",1918,"Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2% and international organic growth was 4.1% with all major regions, except Continental Europe, which decreased only slightly. For the full year, all regions were up organically. Organic growth was 6.1%. 
Q4 operating margin was 20.8% compared with 19.6% a year ago. For the full year, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 11.5%, and operating profit increased 11%. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.63 and was $0.66, excluding expense of $0.03 per share, for business dispositions, which is reflected pretax in our other expense lines. 
Full year diluted EPS was $1.09 per share and would have been $1.21 per share, excluding business dispositions expense in Q3 and Q4, which were largely noncash. We purchased 14 million shares for $285 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.15 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, its' worth noting a few below-the-line items. The $12 million of expense for the dispositions of a few nonstrategic agency offices is reflected in our other expense line, below operating income. Our effective tax rate adjusted for the dispositions, was 33.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% for the full year, which compares favorably to last year's adjusted tax rate. Our tax rate has been volatile from year-to-year given our operations in over 100 countries, our utilization of loss carryforwards and the requirements of a regular adjusting valuation allowances. 
In 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from the implementation of brand new strategies and from the net reversal of small tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter. We expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 37% to 39% in 2016. It is also worth noting that our cash tax rate in 2015 was 29%. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.2 billion. Compared to Q4 '14, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 5.5%, while net dispositions were negative 20 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 5.2%. 
For the full year, the strength of the U.S. dollar continue to have a significant translation impact on reported revenues and operating expenses in all international regions. Revenue growth for 2015 was, therefore, 1%, consisting of 6.1% organic growth and a positive 30 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 5.4%. 
It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $25 million organically in 2015 compared to 2014, which was an impact of 30 basis points in organic growth. Lower pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar, however, by lower O&G expense. We anticipate a similar negative pass-through impact of 30 to 50 basis points in total organic growth in 2016, which is reflected in the growth targets Michael shared earlier. 
On the bottom portion of this slide, Q4 revenue growth balance between our IAN and CMG segments, which had growth of 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. 
For the full year, organic growth at IAN was a robust 6.7%. At CMG, organic growth was 3.6% for the year, with the important qualifier that this is where we see a disproportionately large impact from decreasing pass-through revenue on the smaller of the 2 segments. Underlying growth at CMG was high single-digit percent. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 6.2%, driven by growth from existing clients and net new business. We were led by our largest fully integrated networks, McCann and FCB as well as by Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge. We had strong performance for PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Among client sectors, tech and telecom and health care continue to be growth leaders. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 6.8% with increases across all major disciplines, with sector leadership from tech and telecom and health care. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 7% organically in Q4. We continue to see solid performance from McCann and FCB and had notable growth at Jack Morton. The U.K. organic growth was 6.6% for the full year. 
In Continental Europe, the environment for growth continue to be challenging, and our agencies' revenue change in the quarter was negative 80 basis points. In our largest markets, we had moderate growth in Germany, but that was offset by decreases in France, Spain and Italy. 
For the full year, organic growth for Continental Europe was a positive 1.4%. Overall, the continent represented 9% of our 2015 revenue mix. 
In Asia Pacific, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 7.9% in Q4. That was on top of 13% growth a year ago. Among our largest national markets, we had solid increases in India, Australia and China. We had growth across most of our agencies, including Mediabrands, McCann, Mullen Lowe, Jack Morton, Weber Shandwick and R/GA. For the year, organic growth in the region was 8.3%, paced by double-digit growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
In LatAm, we grew 5.5% organically in the quarter on top of 11% growth a year ago. We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, along with a slight decrease in Brazil due to continued macro headwinds. Our growth in the region was led by McCann, Huge and R/GA. For the year, organic growth was 4.7%. 
In our other markets group, revenue increased 60 basis points organically on top of 12% organic growth in Q4 '14. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, with strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.1% for calendar 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, the organic increase in our operating expenses was 3.1% compared with 5.2% organic revenue growth. Salaries and related expense decreased to 56.2% for the fourth quarter revenue compared with 57.4% a year ago. That was mainly due to lower incentive and other performance-based expenses in the quarter. Incentive expenses were accrued at a higher level over the first 9 months this year compared to 2014 due to strong operating performance throughout the year. Base payroll, benefits and tax increased as a percentage of revenue in Q4, mainly due to the impact of currency changes. Office and general expenses were 23% of fourth quarter revenue this year, the same level as last year. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.8% on an organic basis compared to organic revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Looking at the sources of operating leverage for the full year. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue improved 20 basis points to 63.8% from 64% in 2014. Underneath that, base payroll, benefits and tax expense was 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.6% a year ago, but it is worth noting that this ratio would have improved by 20 basis points if not for the decrease in our pass-through revenue, which is offset in our O&G expenses. Expense for temporary labor was 3.6% of revenue for the full year in 2015 compared to 3.8% a year ago. 
Incentive expenses were 3.7% of revenue for the full year compared to 3.5% in 2014, reflecting strong performance against our financial targets, almost entirely in our long-term incentive programs. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2015, the same level as a year ago. Our salary -- our other salaries and related category was 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.2% in 2014. 
Year-end headcount was approximately 49,000, an increase of 3.6%. The increases were due to higher growth areas of our portfolio, including McCann, Mediabrands, public relations and for digital talent, notably in support of new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expenses for the full year. O&G was 24.7% of revenue compared to 25.6% in 2014. We had operating leverage on nearly all of our O&G categories as our real estate, purchasing, shared service and IT teams continue to drive significant efficiencies. That includes 40 basis points on occupancy, 10 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 50 basis points on all other O&G, which includes the benefits of lower pass-throughs. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point of 11.5%, we have come a long way. There is still work to be done, and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on the impact of business dispositions on our diluted earnings per share. As shown here, our loss on sales of businesses was $12 million in Q4 and with minimal tax benefit, resulting in a loss of $0.03 per diluted share. 
For the full year, at right, the expense of our business sales was $50 million before tax with, again, only a small tax shield. Result was a loss of $0.12 per diluted share for the year. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison is $1.21 per share for this year and $0.98 per share for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 10, and the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.51 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.67 billion a year ago. We returned $481 million to shareholders during the year through our share repurchase and common stock dividends. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2015 was $674 million compared with $670 million a year ago. That includes $118 million used in working capital compared with $131 million a year ago. Our investing activities used $203 million in the year, including $161 million for CapEx and $29 million for acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $473 million in 2015, mainly $285 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $196 million in common stock dividends. In 2015, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $158 million. 
Slide 12 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 billion in 2007 to our current debt level of $1.76 billion at the end of 2015. 
Slide 13 shows the total of our average basic plus dilutive shares over time and at the far right, the total as of year-end 2015. This has been an area of substantial progress, with average total shares decreasing by 125 million shares over the time period. Our starting position for 2016 is $409 million on the right. 
In summary, on Slide 14, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation as evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2016. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our offerings with particular emphasis on our creative and digital capabilities. We further strengthened our position as the destination of choice for the industry's top talent. 
One key element of our talent strategy is a long-standing successful commitment to diversity and inclusion. We reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs. And we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to diversity objectives. 
We began our formal programs a decade ago. Since then, we've seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce. An environment that encourage respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. The quality of our people and our work help us deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth, and we further enhanced operating margin by 100 basis points. We also continued to strengthen our capital structure, achieve investment-grade status from all the major credit agencies and built on our strong shareholder return programs. 
Highlights of our performance included continued progress in McCann Worldgroup and share growth at CMG as well as outstanding performance from Mediabrands in the midst of a historically unprecedented number of media account reviews. 
R/GA delivered its strongest financial and reputational year ever. FCB continued in the successful implementation of its turnaround plan. We, once again, saw dynamic growth from our digital special agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across our portfolio. 
The quality of our offerings is at its highest level in well over a decade. This was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio. We, once again, led all holding companies in AdAge A-List honors, with R/GA, McCann and Deutsche on this prestigious list and UM chosen as Media Agency of the Year, a designation it also earned from Adweek. 
Of course, every marketing discipline, we posted exceptional performance in the industry's most important competitions that award creativity and marketing effectiveness. Weber Shandwick and Golin won numerous PR agency of the year honors. Our health care agencies dominated the medical marketing and media awards. At Cannes, R/GA was named Agency of the Year and the marketing agency brought home the Grand Prix in the film category. 
In terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG agencies performance in Effie Awards globally led the industry, with Mullen Lowe taking both the Grand Effie and winning Agency of the Year. 
Importantly, the effective of our agencies was equally apparent in consistently strong new business performance throughout the year. During 2015, McCann posted strong growth across the range of its agencies and further improved it's creative profile. Management continued to build on the level of collaboration and cross-selling within Worldgroup as well as the strong digital and accountability offerings at MRM. The agency also strengthened its already powerful position in key markets, such as India, China and Brazil. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relations agencies, Weber and Golin, continued to make -- bring market share, driven by growth from their largest clients and best-in-class digital and content market capabilities, where both firms have established positions at the forefront of their field. Octagon and Jack Morton remain leaders in their respective disciplines. 
Mediabrands was also a top-tier performer with very strong performance in the media reviews that dominated the headlines in 2015. Having already won the U.S. J&J, Coke and CVS assignments, UM closed the year by prevailing in the global J&J consolidation and added a solid showing in the Sony review in early 2016. The organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data capabilities are playing a key role in Mediabrands' success. 
R/GA had an outstanding year, which featured strong growth as well as creative work that is recognized across all digital media, and increasingly, at traditional channels as well. The agency is also a leader in terms of innovation, not only in the agency's offerings, but also with the accelerator programs, where we incubate start-ups and share learnings with many other major clients. 
Positive momentum at FCB continue as the agency secured new assignments from leading advertisers such as InBev, Coca-Cola, Fiat Chrysler. At Cannes, FCB had its best performance ever in the arrival of a tremendously talented, new global creative leader and take the quality of the agency's product to an even greater height. 
FCB's health care offering was, once again, a top performer in its space. Mullen Lowe continued to progress. Their position as a nimble global network with a strong creative culture and contemporary hyper-bundled approach is being well-received in the marketplace. The global leadership team is aligned and energized. We are also seeing the benefits from the integration of Profero as the group's digital partner, especially in key markets such as the U.S., U.K. and China. 
Our focus on open architecture solutions, which combined the best of our talent from across the organization was, once again, a meaningful contributor to our results. Many multiagency opportunities came into the group, domestically and internationally. The largest of these included the year's most significant holding company review in Latin America, LATAM Airlines, which we are now serving in over 20 countries as well as J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which further underscores the value that our custom-built Wx unit delivers to this important client. And we continue to improve our delivery of integrated, multiagency solutions for existing multinationals. 
Overall, our strong performance in 2015 reflects a series of long-term strategic decisions we backed with significant investment over time. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, the open architecture model that I just discussed as well as embedding digital experience into all our agencies. Our commitment to developing new skills, products and services and incorporating technology in all of our offerings had allowed us to stay highly relevant in the digital world. 
For the year, we also saw continued progress related to the operating and financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability keep us on track to achieving our long-term goal. Many initiatives are fueling the strong profitability trajectory that Frank shared with you. Among them are our performance incentives put in place that are driving continued focus on leveraging our investment in base payroll and temporary labor. 
On the real estate front, our measure of square-foot per employee decreased again in 2015 by approximately 3% to 202 square feet, down from over 240 square feet a few years ago. 
In the back office, over 75% of global revenue is now on an SAP platform, most of which is supported by our shared services. This included 2,005 additions in India, China and the U.S., with plans to add our agencies in Australia and Brazil in 2016. 
Our return of capital programs also continued to positively impact results, and we've put approximately $2.5 billion towards total shareholder returns since 2011, the point in which we reinstituted these programs. 
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on these robust capital return programs. The latter is evident in our board's actions announced today, with our dividend increase by 25% and provided for current authorization of approximately $460 million of share repurchase. 
We are well positioned as we move into 2016. As you've heard me say before, complexity is good because the value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant to clients as they seek to navigate a dynamic media and marketing landscape. 
The general tone of the business remains solid. Yet as we've seen since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets, and we will closely monitor the impact it has on consumer sentiment. We are, therefore, approaching the year with appropriate degree of caution. Therefore, for 2016, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth and improvement of margin of 50 basis points or more. Coupled with our continued commitment to capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. 
We thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. 
At this point, I'll open it up for questions."

If you look at how we finished the fourth quarter, the tone of our business was solid. That said, as we look into 2016, everyone on a global basis is watching this very carefully and are concerned about the future direction of the global economy. Our business is subject to changes in macroeconomics, and that's why we put a tone of caution in terms of our forecast for 2016. That said, we haven't seen major pullbacks by our clients. We do our budgeting on a 0-up basis. We take all of our agencies, they look at their business -- book of business. They look at what they anticipate, based on conversations with our clients. They put some levels of caution in those numbers. They also put some levels of optimism in terms of to-be-generated revenue. It's not an exact science, and -- which is why, if you look at 2015, we started the year fairly conservative. And as we went through the year, we upped our guidance and we expanded our margin expectations. But the tone right now is okay and particularly, if you look at 59% of our businesses in the United States, and although we don't see high expectations in terms of growth, 3% to 4% growth in the United States enables us to expand margin by at least 50 basis points. And that's, to answer your other question, gives us a conversion of around close to 30%, which is what we've always said. And if you expand the organic growth, that's where you see expansion of over the 50 basis points. So the tone of the business, at least right now, is consistent. But again, given this volatility, it's something that we have to put some element of caution out there, and I think it would be irresponsible for us not to have done that. And certainly, you're seeing that by our competitors in terms of the numbers they're showing. Let me just comment. Frank mentioned it. We do build in our 3% to 4% some element of our pass-through in that guidance. So if you assume the 30 to 50 basis point reduction in the pass-throughs, effectively, that organic number is 3.5 to 4.5. And let me just add that, that pass-through is a direct pass-through. It's not us taking positions with respect to digital inventory, which I'm sure will be another question. As far as the headwinds and tailwinds, we had some great wins on the media side. We did have some losses. There is a change in the tone of our business, and that is because a significant part of our business growth is coming from digital. Digital business tends to be much more project-oriented. And as a result, some projects that we were able to deliver in 2015, we're not sure of repeating in 2016. So with respect to tailwinds, the tailwinds aren't as specific as we've said going into 2015. That said, we do have tailwinds, but I wouldn't equate them to as high a number as we had in 2015. But the other side of it, given our performance on the digital side, we believe our offerings are so strong that we'll see project-based business continue in 2016."

We've used up our NOL in the U.S., which is why the cash taxes have gone up. We still have over $1 billion of NOL, but that's principally over in Europe, which we can't use until those earnings take effect. So we did see some benefit there. But basically, our cash taxes are in the 29% range right now. Yes, I think it's different. Now look, first of all, let me talk about the U.K. I think what we have seen, if you compare it to 2 years ago, a turnaround in the U.K. So we're forecasting -- and as our performance this year was 7% to 8%, and we see a solid year for the U.K. as well going into 2016. So I think that's a -- and that's a big -- it's 9% of our business, and so therefore, that's encouraging for us going into 2016. I think Continental Europe, anecdotally, seems to be better, but I haven't met anyone who isn't concerned about Continental Europe. I was in Davos. The conversations continue to be concerned with the financial institutions in Europe, in particular, and I think that uncertainty drives our clients to be concerned. That said, it's a global economy and there's no question that our multinational clients are looking for growth markets, India, China, Latin America. Frankly, United States, we're seeing good pickup in the United States. And I think that's a little bit different than it was a couple of years ago. So there's no question that this volatility in the financial markets and in the financial institutions is giving everyone a lot of angst in terms of, whether it be access to liquidity, whether affecting the capital markets. And if I were running one of those companies, I would be looking hard at our spend, which puts an additional burden on what we have to do. I think -- they're not stopping spending. They're just being very careful in terms of where they spend. And that puts the burden on us to prove that what we do actually works. And if we can put together a fully integrated offering that shows how we can move the needle, it's innovative, we save some money in the process, we're effective, we're held accountable for the performance of that, then I think our clients have the money to spend, and they will do that. But they do have an element of caution in that, which is why we're still early in the year and a lot of things are happening. And let's face it, we have issues with oil, and who knows what's going to happen with the price of oil and those kind of things. So there is caution out there. But what's amazing is our business -- as I said, we're not expecting a 6% growth again. We're expecting -- we're forecasting 3% to 4%. And if we deliver 3% to 4%, we can expand margin by a healthy 50 basis points or better. And I think that's a reasonable way to go into 2016. I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but I'm just trying to be cautious in terms of what may be ahead of us. And if we're wrong, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there."

Digital capability, social networking, social media, content, all of that is part of what we're seeing across the board in both digital and PR agencies and our traditional agencies. And as a result, Weber Shandwick, in particular, was a leader in terms of looking at their portfolio and converting to the digital and social environment, and as a result, we've seen them taking market share out there. It's because of their content and new thinking in terms of PR. So we're encouraged by that. We think they -- we have best-in-class offerings there, and we continue to see solid growth there. Frank?"

And you look at our performance at Weber, at Golin, at DeVries, it's clear they're gaining market share. And the critical thing is, we're going to need to continue to invest and keep to our place in the marketplace. And looking at the rest of the portfolio, our sports business at Octagon, our experiential business at Jack Morton, very, very strong. And the CMG segment does get impacted by the decline in pass-throughs, and that's intentional. We've been trying to migrate our contracts away from being a principal, specifically, in our experiential business, to an agent. So when you look at it on a net revenue basis, our growth has been high single digits for the past 3 years. So those businesses are very, very healthy, and it's nice. And our branding business at FutureBrand has had, again, a very strong year. So we're very supportive of that segment. We'll continue to invest."

By the way, when we say we talk about invest, we actually had an acquisition by Golin in China this year. And we haven't had -- we basically grow our business in China organically by hiring some really talented people, as we did in 2015.",356,"Yes, let me add. By the way, when we say we talk about invest, we actually had an acquisition by Golin in China this year. And we haven't had -- we basically grow our business in China organically by hiring some really talented people, as we did in 2015. But for Golin, we actually hired -- we bought a company that's very attractive and added to their portfolio. The other important point is, when we talk about integrated offerings, we mean it. And so when we put together open architecture, whether it's Golin, whether it's Octagon, whether it's Weber Shandwick, we bring them into the open architecture model. So when we're sitting at the table and presenting the best of IPG to our clients, it includes a full array of our businesses. So our marketing services, our traditional agency businesses, our digital capabilities and our media, they're all sitting at the table. And frankly, that's what clients want to see. And the collaboration is critical to that, which is why we spend so much time on collaboration within IPG. And this open architecture model actually works. And even on -- when we're just looking at media pitches, we bring in the open architecture on media. We have different disciplines, digital, experiential, all of that comes to play in these pitches. And frankly, I'm a firm believer that's one of the reasons we've been successful in the new business arena. Because I've heard a number of clients say to me when we walk out of the room, that was refreshing is that they didn't know, which individuals was from which discipline. And the team really spoke as one voice, and -- when they were focusing on clients. And then that's makes a big difference to the clients because they don't have to worry about our silos and our issues. They're just interested in servicing their clients. And if we didn't have the marketing service arm that we have at CMG and the media and the digital capabilities and the creative capabilities at our agencies, we wouldn't be able to do that. So I'm very comfortable with that."

I'm curious about how you think about either making or refraining from strategic shifts at the holding company level versus encouraging the individual business units to do the same. We've seen Publicis obviously stake a claim in consulting services, and WPP may be a bit more investing across ecosystem in content and media and there's some data.

First of all, as you know, Philippe is sort of an integral part of the collaboration we have at IPG. Henry's done a tremendous job in coming into Mediabrands, and the success of Mediabrands is pretty evident by the results of their performance, and he's done a great job, him and his team at UM, Initiative and all the rest of Mediabrands. Philippe's oversight role at Mediabrands is exactly that, to bring -- to make sure that we're looking at all the possibilities of collaboration and is well -- Philippe has a technology background and helping in terms of new media and new technology as well. So it was exceptionally well received in -- at Mediabrands and the people. Plus frankly, Philippe has an HR responsibility, so he knows a lot of those people very well, and they work very closely together. So I can't tell you how many favorable e-mails I received from both clients as well as individuals on that move. So we're really excited about it. Marketing services, as I said, it fits very nicely into the open architecture model. I don't believe we have to own various data sources and so on, when we can rent them. But that said, we did a data analytics acquisition in Israel this year. Mediabrands has their own data sources, and when they need to use that, they have over 80 or 100 different data sources. So as long as there's partnering out there where we can rent it, we think we have to do it. We have a sufficient amount of analytics and data to make our offerings competitive, if not better, and we don't have to own it. But when there are unique opportunities out there, we make some tactical investments in it. We did it in a little -- in Samba TV, we did it in Kiip. So we look at it both ways. The key to this in the open architecture is having a vehicle without having to restructure our corporation to collaborate. And since we've been doing it for 10 years, we didn't need to restructure our entire company. We have high-priority objectives for all of our CEOs that require them to collaborate, both within their networks as well as outside. So it's kind of interesting to see everybody jumping on this, but we started doing this 10 years ago, and it's part of our DNA. And every time there's a new thing out there in terms of -- whether it be data, whether it be content, we want to participate, and we'll do it through our partnerships, through investments or just contractual arrangements."

That said, every once in a while, we're opportunistic. You saw we were a little overweighted in the fourth quarter when we saw some price pressure on our stock. So we have the flexibility. But for analytics point, if you use $300 million, I think that's a reasonable number for us to spend, and we'll be opportunistic and see how the marketplace goes. This is part of a long-term strategy. We believe that given our leverage, obviously, bringing our ratings up one more notch would be very helpful to us in that it will give us a freer commercial paper program, which could help us in terms of cyclicality of our cash flows. And that could free up some additional cash as well. So from an overall program point of view, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and where we are. We hope to have a commercial paper program if we get one more notch up. We have a robust return of capital on buybacks, and a 25% increase in dividend is a very nice mix between dividends and buybacks. So our overall structure in terms of return has been very well-received by the investors before year-end. Between Frank and myself and Jerry, we've met with most of our shareholders, and this is based on the input we're getting from all of our shareholders. And as far as our leverage, we're very comfortable, and we want to be where we are heading into a market that is as volatile -- or potentially volatile as it is right now."

And there aren't many companies that have the capabilities we have, both in terms of typical advertising role, media planning, content distribution, digital expertise, insights, all of that put together. And frankly, what we do actually works, and we have data, and we have all sorts of information that shows that if we can bring all of these offerings together, we can, in fact, help our clients move the needle. And it's refreshing to be able to walk into a room and put together some new ideas from a business context. And you're right, it's not just traditional advertising. It's looking into the future. We can anticipate where consumers are going to be spending their money. And based on those insights, we can help our clients, real time, look at where they can allocate their dollars. And if it's not working, we can shift with them. We can create dashboards with our clients. We can help them do design work. We can do branding for them. It really turns out to be a full-service offering that we can tap into, and it gives them a degree of comfort that they're getting cutting-edge insights without having to add 12 different disciplines coming in a room, working together. So I do believe -- and of course, we do consulting. I mean, some of our agencies have a consulting basis arm to it. So yes, our business is changing and frankly, that's why I'm bullish on our industry. For years, they've talked about our industry being disintermediated, going away. We always find a way to sustain ourselves. And I think if you look at our results, you have a pretty good indication that we're capable of doing that. So yes, I thank you for that question. 
With that said, I think those are our last questions. I really thank you for your support throughout the year. We're excited about 2016, notwithstanding some caution that we've made, and I look forward to bringing it to light. Thank you very much."

As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report a very strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights: Organic revenue growth was 5.2% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 6.1% for the full year. In 2015, we grew organically in every major region of the world and across nearly all major agencies and client sectors. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 120 basis points, marking our highest Q4 margin in at least a decade. Full year operating margin was 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2014, which is at the high end of the range we targeted coming into the year. Operating profit increased 11% for the full year. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year was up 23% to $1.21 from $0.98 in 2014. That excludes a loss of $0.12 per share this year, largely noncash due to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses in the third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.66, excluding a loss of $0.03 per share from business dispositions. 
Over the last 2 years, in a very fast-changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 12%, which is outstanding compared to our principal peers. During that 2-year span, we have also increased operating profit by 32% and comparable diluted EPS by 55%. 
All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent, the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients are what drives such terrific results in the marketplace. We thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.2%. Currency had a negative 5.5% impact on revenue, while net business dispositions were a negative 20 basis points. We posted notably strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pac, U.K. and LatAm. Continental Europe remained challenged, although the region did show modest organic growth for the full year. 
Our Q4 growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media, public relations. We continue to have specially strong performance from the digital services embedded across the portfolio, as well as growth at digital specialists, R/GA, Huge and MRM//McCann. 
At the agency level, a wide range of our portfolio contributed to growth, led by McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were tech and telecom, health care and financial services. 
New business was another highlight of the quarter. In media, we were pleased to add Johnson & Johnson's global buying and planning to the roster of 2015 media wins that includes U.S. responsibilities for J&J, Coca-Cola and CVS. Creative wins in the quarter included Verizon Wireless, MGM Resorts, ALDI Nord and Bank of America's retail business. As a result, our net new business was positive in Q4, as it has been through the year. 
Operating expenses were again well managed. Underneath organic growth of 5.2% in the quarter, our organic operating expense increase was 3.1%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, operating margin expansion of 100 basis points reflects leverage on both our salaries and related and our office and general expenses. 
During Q4, we repurchased 5 million shares using $113 million. For the full year, we utilized $285 million for the repurchase of 14 million shares and our year-end share count eligible for dilution decreased 3% compared to 2014. This activity builds on a sustained capital return program that we initiated in 2011. Since that time, we've returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase, and we reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by over 25%. 
In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we have announced this morning our board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.15 per share. This marks our third consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increases of 25% or more. 
We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with $159 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $459 million. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial and operational strength of IPG, as well as our future prospects. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. It's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at a high level, and we remain committed to a disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value. 
As you can see in our results today, the tone of the business remains solid through year-end in most major world regions, and we all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic every day due to the pace of technological innovation and shifting consumer behavior. This represents further opportunity for our company as well as our industry. Given these trends, as well as the overall strength of our offerings, we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth. 
There are, however, factors that require us to temper our outlook. Of course, our industry-leading results for the past 2 years sets a high bar for comparable performance in 2016. Moreover, in certain markets, macro conditions present uncertainties and even headwinds. This is true most clearly in Brazil, but also with respect to markets such as Continental Europe and the Middle East. 
There's also a concern for slowing in China. The currency environment remains volatile, which could have negative effects on clients spending. As we've said since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, the uncertainty we're all experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution. 
Notwithstanding this environment, for 2016, we are currently targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Net acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth in the year. It's worth noting that at current FX rates, the currency impact to our top line, as well as to our operating expenses is expected to be approximately negative 2.5% for the full year. 
Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on our record operating margin expansion. We are, therefore, targeting an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement in 2016, which would bring us to at least 12%, closer to our objective of 13% operating margin or better. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective when we report back to you during our quarterly calls. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on our results."

On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2%, international organic growth was 4.1%, with all major regions, except Continental Europe, which decreased only slightly. For the full year, all regions were up organically. Organic growth was 6.1%. 
Q4 operating margin was 20.8% compared with 19.6% a year ago. For the full year, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 11.5%, and operating profit increased 11%. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.63 and was $0.66, excluding expense of $0.03 per share for business dispositions, which is reflected pretax in our other expense line. 
Full year diluted EPS was $1.09 per share and would have been $1.21 per share, excluding business dispositions expense in Q3 and Q4, which were largely noncash. We purchased 14 million shares for $285 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.15 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting a few below-the-line items. The $12 million of expense for the dispositions of a few nonstrategic agency offices is reflected in our other expense line, below operating income. 
Our effective tax rate, adjusted for the dispositions, was 33.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% for the full year, which compares favorably to last year's adjusted tax rate. Our tax rate has been volatile from year-to-year given our operations in over 100 countries, our utilization of loss carryforwards and the requirements of a regular adjusting valuation allowances. 
In 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from the implementation of planning strategies and from the net reversal of small tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter. We expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 37% to 39% in 2016. It is also worth noting that our cash tax rate in 2015 was 29%. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.2 billion. Compared to Q4 '14, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 5.5%, while net dispositions were a negative 20 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 5.2%. 
For the full year, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to have a significant translation impact on reported revenues and operating expenses in all international regions. Revenue growth for 2015 was, therefore, 1%, consisting of 6.1% organic growth and a positive 30 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 5.4%. 
It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $25 million organically in 2015 compared to 2014, which was an impact of 30 basis points in organic growth. Lower pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar, however, by lower O&G expense. We anticipate a similar negative pass-through impact of 30 to 50 basis points in total organic growth in 2016, which is reflected in the growth targets Michael shared earlier. 
On the bottom portion of this slide, Q4 revenue growth balanced between our IAN and CMG segments, which had growth of 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. 
For the full year, organic growth at IAN was a robust 6.7%. At CMG, organic growth was 3.6% for the year, with the important qualifier that this is where we see a disproportionately large impact from decreasing pass-through revenue on the smaller of the 2 segments. Underlying growth at CMG was high single-digit percent. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 6.2%, driven by growth from existing clients and net new business. We were led by our largest fully integrated networks, McCann and FCB, as well as by Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge. We had strong performance for PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Among client sectors, tech and telecom and health care continue to be growth leaders. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 6.8%, with increases across all major disciplines, with sector leadership from tech and telecom and health care. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 7% organically in Q4. We continue to see solid performance from McCann and FCB and had notable growth at Jack Morton. The U.K. organic growth was 6.6% for the full year. 
In Continental Europe, the environment for growth continued to be challenging, and our agencies' revenue change in the quarter was negative 80 basis points. In our largest markets, we had moderate growth in Germany, but that was offset by decreases in France, Spain and Italy. For the full year, organic growth for Continental Europe was a positive 1.4%. Overall, the continent represented 9% of our 2015 revenue mix. 
In Asia Pacific, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 7.9% in Q4. That was on top of 13% growth a year ago. Among our largest national markets, we had solid increases in India, Australia and China. We had growth across most of our agencies, including Mediabrands, McCann, Mullen Lowe, Jack Morton, Weber Shandwick and R/GA. For the year, organic growth in the region was 8.3%, paced by double-digit growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
In LatAm, we grew 5.5% organically in the quarter, on top of 11% growth a year ago. We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, along with a slight decrease in Brazil due to continued macro headwinds. Our growth in the region was led by McCann, Huge and R/GA. For the year, organic growth was 4.7%. 
In our other markets group, revenue increased 60 basis points organically on top of 12% organic growth in Q4 '14. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, with strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.1% for calendar 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, the organic increase in our operating expenses was 3.1% compared with 5.2% organic revenue growth. Salaries and related expense decreased to 56.2% for the fourth quarter revenue compared with 54 -- 57.4% a year ago. That was mainly due to lower incentive and other performance-based expenses in the quarter. Incentive expenses were accrued at a higher level over the first 9 months this year compared to 2014 due to strong operating performance throughout the year. Base payroll, benefits and tax increased as a percentage of revenue in Q4, mainly due to the impact of currency changes. 
Office and general expenses were 23% of fourth quarter revenue this year, the same level as last year. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.8% on an organic basis compared to organic revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Looking at the sources of operating leverage for the full year. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue improved 20 basis points to 63.8% from 64% in 2014. Underneath that, base payroll, benefits and tax expense was 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.6% a year ago, but it is worth noting that this ratio would have improved by 20 basis points if not for the decrease in our pass-through revenue, which is offset in our O&G expenses. Expense for temporary labor was 3.6% of revenue for the full year in 2015 compared to 3.8% a year ago. 
Incentive expense of 3.7% of revenue for the full year compared to 3.5% in 2014, reflecting strong performance against our financial targets, almost entirely in our long-term incentive programs. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2015, the same level as a year ago. Our salary -- our other salaries and related category was 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.2% in 2014. 
Year-end headcount was approximately 49,000, an increase of 3.6%. The increases were due to hire in growth areas of our portfolio, including McCann, Mediabrands, public relations and, for digital talent, notably in support of new business wins. 
Turning to office and general expenses for the full year. O&G was 24.7% of revenue compared to 25.6% in 2014. We had operating leverage on nearly all of our O&G categories as our real estate, purchasing, shared service and IT teams continue to drive significant efficiencies. That includes 40 basis points on occupancy, 10 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 50 basis points on all other O&G, which includes the benefits of lower pass-throughs. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point of 11.5%, we have come a long way. There is still work to be done, and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on the impact of business dispositions on our diluted earnings per share. As shown here, our loss on sales of businesses was $12 million in Q4 and with minimal tax benefit, resulting in a loss of $0.03 per diluted share. 
For the full year, at right, the expense of our business sales was $50 million before tax with, again, only a small tax shield. Result was a loss of $0.12 per diluted share for the year. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison is $1.21 per share for this year and $0.98 per share for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 10, and the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.51 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.67 billion a year ago. We returned $481 `common stock dividends. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2015 was $674 million compared with $670 million a year ago. That includes $118 million used in working capital compared with $131 million a year ago. Our investing activities used $203 million in the year, including $161 million for CapEx and $29 million for acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $473 million in 2015, mainly $285 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $196 million in common stock dividends. In 2015, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $158 million. 
Slide 12 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 billion in 2007 to our current debt level of $1.76 billion at the end of 2015. 
Slide 13 shows the total of our average basic plus dilutive shares over time and at the far right's just the total as of year-end 2015. This has been an area of substantial progress, with average total shares decreasing by 125 million shares over the time period. Our starting position for 2016 is 409 million on the right. 
In summary, on Slide 14, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation, as evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2016. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

It is a full year report, which is why this is the time of the year where we really provide some more details, so please bear with us. I hope you'll see some of",1471,"Thank you, Frank. Let me apologize for the granularity we're showing on the -- in this report. It is a full year report, which is why this is the time of the year where we really provide some more details, so please bear with us. I hope you'll see some of the important ins and outs in our performance for 2015. 
But from every perspective, 2015 was a very successful year, which saw us accomplish significant milestones in terms of our performance in the marketplace, as well as our financial results. 
We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on our creative and digital capabilities. We further strengthened our position as the destination of choice for the industry's top talent. 
One key element of our talent strategy is a long-standing successful commitment to diversity and inclusion. We reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs. And we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to diversity objectives. 
We began our formal programs a decade ago. Since then, we've seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce. An environment that encourage respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. 
The quality of our people and our work helped us deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth, and we further enhanced operating margin by 100 basis points. We also continued to strengthen our capital structure, achieve investment-grade status from all the major credit agencies and built on our strong shareholder return programs. 
Highlights of our performance included continued progress in McCann Worldgroup and share growth at CMG, as well as outstanding performance from Mediabrands in the midst of a historically unprecedented number of media account reviews. 
R/GA delivered its strongest financial and reputational year ever. FCB continued in the successful implementation of its turnaround plan. We, once again, saw dynamic growth from our digital special agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across our portfolio. 
The quality of our offerings is at its highest level in well over a decade. This was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio. We, once again, led all holding companies in AdAge A-List honors, with R/GA, McCann and Deutsche on this prestigious list and UM chosen as Media Agency of the Year, a designation it also earned from Adweek. 
Across every marketing discipline, we posted exceptional performance in the industry's most important competitions that award creativity and marketing effectiveness. Weber Shandwick and Golin won numerous PR agency of the year honors. Our health care agencies dominated the medical marketing and media awards. At Cannes, R/GA was named Agency of the Year and The Martin Agency brought home the Grand Prix in the film category. 
In terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG agencies' performance in Effie Awards globally led the industry, with Mullen Lowe taking both the Grand Effie and winning Agency of the Year. 
Importantly, the effectiveness of our agencies was equally apparent in consistently strong new business performance throughout the year. During 2015, McCann posted strong growth across the range of its agencies and further improved its creative profile. Management continued to build on the level of collaboration and cross-selling within Worldgroup, as well as the strong digital and accountability offerings at MRM. The agency also strengthened its already powerful position in key markets, such as India, China and Brazil. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relations agencies, Weber and Golin, continued to make -- rein market share, driven by growth from their largest clients and best-in-class digital and content market capabilities, where both firms have established positions at the forefront of their field. Octagon and Jack Morton remain leaders in their respective disciplines. 
Mediabrands was also a top-tier performer, with very strong performance in the media reviews that dominated the headlines in 2015. Having already won the U.S. J&J, Coke and CVS assignments, UM closed the year by prevailing in the global J&J consolidation and added a solid showing in the Sony review in early 2016. The organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data capabilities are playing a key role in Mediabrands' success. 
R/GA had an outstanding year, which featured strong growth as well as creative work that is recognized across all digital media, and increasingly, at traditional channels as well. The agency is also a leader in terms of innovation, not only in the agency's offerings, but also with Accelerator programs, where we incubate start-ups and share learnings with many other major clients. 
Positive momentum at FCB continued as the agency secured new assignments from leading advertisers such as InBev, Coca-Cola, Fiat Chrysler. At Cannes, FCB had its best performance ever in the arrival of a tremendously talented, new global creative leader to take the quality of the agency's product to an even greater height. 
FCB's health care offering was, once again, a top performer in its space. Mullen Lowe continued to progress. Their position as a nimble global network with a strong creative culture and contemporary hyper-bundled approach is being well-received in the marketplace. The global leadership team is aligned and energized. We are also seeing the benefits from the integration of Profero as the group's digital partner, especially in key markets such as the U.S., U.K. and China. 
Our focus on open architecture solutions, which combined the best of our talent from across the organization, was, once again, a meaningful contributor to our results. Many multiagency opportunities came into the group, domestically and internationally. The largest of these included the year's most significant holding company review in Latin America, LATAM Airlines, which we are now serving in over 20 countries, as well as J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which further underscores the value that our custom-built Wx unit delivers to this important client. And we continue to improve our delivery of integrated, multiagency solutions for existing multinationals. 
Overall, our strong performance in 2015 reflects a series of long-term strategic decisions which we back with significant investment over time. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, the open architecture model that I just discussed, as well as embedding digital experience into all our agencies. Our commitment to developing new skills, products and services and incorporating technology in all of our offerings has allowed us to stay highly relevant in the digital world. 
For the year, we also saw continued progress related to the operating and financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability keep us on track to achieving our long-term goal. 
Many initiatives are fueling the strong profitability trajectory that Frank shared with you. Among them are our performance incentives put in place that are driving continued focus on leveraging our investment in base payroll and temporary labor. 
On the real estate front, our measure of square-foot per employee decreased again in 2015 by approximately 3% to 202 square feet, down from over 240 square feet a few years ago. 
In the back office, over 75% of global revenue is now on an SAP platform, most of which is supported by our shared services. This included 2,005 additions in India, China and the U.S., with plans to add our agencies in Australia and Brazil in 2016. 
Our return of capital programs also continued to positively impact results, and we've put approximately $2.5 billion towards total shareholder returns since 2011, the point in which we reinstituted these programs. 
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on these robust capital return programs. The latter is evident in our board's actions announced today, with our dividend increase by 25% and provided for a current authorization of approximately $460 million of share repurchase. 
We are well positioned as we move into 2016. As you've heard me say before, complexity is good because the value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant to clients as they seek to navigate a dynamic media and marketing landscape. 
The general tone of the business remains solid. Yet, as we've seen since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets, and we will closely monitor the impact it has on consumer sentiment. We are, therefore, approaching the year with appropriate degree of caution. 
Therefore, for 2016, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth and improvement of margin of 50 basis points or more. Coupled with our continued commitment to capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. 
We thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. 
At this point, I'll open it up for questions."

If you look at how we finished the fourth quarter, the tone of our business was solid. That said, as we look into 2016, everyone on a global basis is watching this very carefully and are concerned about the future direction of the global economy. Our business is subject to changes in macroeconomics, and that's why we put a tone of caution in terms of our forecast for 2016. That said, we haven't seen major pullbacks by our clients. We do our budgeting on a 0-up basis. We take all of our agencies, they look at their business -- book of business. They look at what they anticipate, based on conversations with our clients. They put some levels of caution in those numbers. They also put some levels of optimism in terms of to-be-generated revenue. It's not an exact science, and -- which is why, if you look at 2015, we started the year fairly conservative. And as we went through the year, we upped our guidance and we expanded our margin expectations. But the tone right now is okay. And particularly, if you look at 59% of our businesses in the United States, and although we don't see high expectations in terms of growth, 3% to 4% growth in the United States enables us to expand margin by at least 50 basis points. And that's -- to answer your other question, gives us a conversion of around close to 30%, which is what we've always said. And if you expand the organic growth, that's where you see expansion of over the 50 basis points. So the tone of the business, at least right now, is consistent. But again, given this volatility, it's something that we have to put some element of caution out there, and I think it would be irresponsible for us not to have done that. And certainly, you're seeing that by our competitors in terms of the numbers they're showing. Let me just comment. Frank mentioned it. We do build in, in our 3% to 4% some element of our pass-through in that guidance. So if you assume the 30 to 50 basis point reduction in the pass-throughs, effectively, that organic number is 3.5% to 4.5%. And let me just add that, that pass-through is a direct pass-through. It's not us taking positions with respect to digital inventory, which I'm sure will be another question. As far as the headwinds and tailwinds, we had some great wins on the media side. We did have some losses. There is a change in the tone of our business, and that is because a significant part of our business growth is coming from digital, digital business tends to be much more project-oriented. And as a result, some projects that we were able to deliver in 2015, we're not sure of repeating in 2016. So with respect to tailwinds, the tailwinds aren't as specific as we've said going into 2015. That said, we do have tailwinds, but I wouldn't equate them to as high a number as we had in 2015. But the other side of it, given our performance on the digital side, we believe our offerings are so strong that we'll see project-based business continue in 2016."

I'm wondering if maybe you can time travel back to the last 2 Februaries, when you also guided the 3% to 4%, and help us think about whether there's anything different that you see today in macro uncertainty versus the last 2 years, where I think Europe was probably at front of mind. Obviously, we've got some issues in other -- in emerging markets now. I'm just wondering if you think things are worse, better or sort of similar to how your clients are talking to you about their business today versus the past years, when obviously, you delivered such a strong result. And then, you had made a comment at a recent conference that you thought media review activity could be pretty high in '16. I'm just wondering maybe you could revisit that comment and sort of fill us in a little bit. And then, Frank, I'm just wondering if maybe you could give us some cash tax guidance or help for '16. Or any comment around your NOL position at this point."

We've used up our NOL in the U.S., which is why the cash taxes have gone up. We still have over $1 billion of NOL, but that's principally over in Europe, which we can't use until those earnings take effect. So we did see some benefit there. But basically, our cash taxes are in the 29% range right now. Yes, I think it's different. Now look, first of all, let me talk about the U.K. I think what we have seen, if you compare it to 2 years ago, a turnaround in the U.K. So we're forecasting -- and as our performance this year was 7% to 8%, and we see a good, solid year for the U.K. as well going into 2016. So I think that's a -- and that's a big -- it's 9% of our business, and so therefore, that's encouraging for us going into 2016. I think Continental Europe, anecdotally, seems to be better, but I haven't met anyone who isn't concerned about Continental Europe. I was in Davos. The conversations continue to be concerned with the financial institutions in Europe, in particular, and I think that uncertainty drives our clients to be concerned. That said, it's a global economy and there's no question that our multinational clients are looking for growth markets, India, China, Latin America. Frankly, United States, we're seeing good pickup in the United States. And I think that's a little bit different than it was a couple of years ago. So there's no question that this volatility in the financial markets and in the financial institutions is giving everyone a lot of angst in terms of, whether it be access to liquidity, whether affecting the capital markets. And if I were running one of those companies, I would be looking hard at our spend, which puts an additional burden on what we have to do. I think they're not stopping spending; they're just being very careful in terms of where they spend. And that puts the burden on us to prove that what we do actually works. And if we can put together a fully integrated offering that shows how we can move the needle, it's innovative, we save some money in the process, we're effective, we're held accountable for the performance of that, then I think our clients have the money to spend, and they will do that. But they do have an element of caution in that, which is why it's still early in the year and a lot of things are happening. And let's face it, we have issues with oil, and who knows what's going to happen with the price of oil and those kind of things. So there is caution out there. But what's amazing is our business -- as I said, we're not expecting a 6% growth again. We're expecting -- we're forecasting 3% to 4%. And if we deliver 3% to 4%, we can expand margin by a healthy 50 basis points or better. And I think that's a reasonable way to go into 2016. I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but I'm just trying to be cautious in terms of what may be ahead of us. And if we're wrong, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there."

And again, as you recall, those are direct pass-throughs from revenue and expenses. I'll comment on PR, and so I'm going let Frank talk about it since it falls within his purview. Remember, the PR business has changed dramatically, okay? It -- what's happening is all our different disciplines are all covering all sort of aspects of the marketplace. Digital capability, social networking, social media, content, all of that is part of what we're seeing across the board in both digital and PR agencies and our traditional agencies. And as a result, Weber Shandwick, in particular, was a leader in terms of looking at their portfolio and converting to the digital and social environment, and as a result, we've seen them taking market share out there. It's because of their content and new thinking in terms of PR. So we're encouraged by that. We think they -- we have best-in-class offerings there, and we continue to see solid growth there. Frank?"

And you look at our performance at Weber, at Golin, at DeVries, it's clear they're gaining market share. And the critical thing is we're going to need to continue to invest and keep to our place in the marketplace. And looking at the rest of the portfolio, our sports business at Octagon, our experiential business at Jack Morton, that's very, very strong. And the CMG segment does get impacted by the decline in pass-throughs, and that's intentional. We've been trying to migrate our contracts away from being a principal, specifically, in our experiential business, to an agent. So when you look at it on a net revenue basis, our growth has been high single digits for the past 3 years. So those businesses are very, very healthy, and it's nice. And our branding business at FutureBrand's had, again, a very strong year. So we're very supportive of that segment and we'll continue to invest."

By the way, when we say we talk about invest, we actually had an acquisition by Golin in China this year. And we haven't had one -- we basically grow our businesses in China organically by hiring some really talented people, as we did in 2015. But for Golin, we actually hired -- we bought a company that's very attractive and added to their portfolio. The other important point is, when we talk about integrated offerings, we mean it. And so when we put together open architecture, whether it's Golin, whether it's Octagon, whether it's Weber Shandwick, we bring them into the open architecture model. So when we're sitting at the table and presenting the best of IPG to our clients, it includes a full array of our businesses. So our marketing services, our traditional agency businesses, our digital capabilities and our media, they're all sitting at the table. And frankly, that's what clients want to see. And the collaboration is critical to that, which is why we spend so much time on collaboration within IPG. And this open architecture model actually works. And even on -- when we're just looking at media pitches, we bring in the open architecture on media. We have different disciplines, digital, experiential, all of that comes to play in these pitches. And frankly, I'm a firm believer that's one of the reasons we've been successful in the new business arena. Because I've heard a number of clients say to me when we walked out of the room, that what was a -- it was refreshing is that they didn't know which individuals was from which discipline. And the team really spoke as one voice, and when -- they were focusing on clients. And that's makes a big difference to the clients because they don't have to worry about our silos and our issues. They're just interested in servicing their clients. And if we didn't have the marketing service arm that we have at CMG and the media and the digital capabilities and the creative capabilities at our agencies, we wouldn't be able to do that. So I'm very comfortable with that."

Henry's done a tremendous job in coming into Mediabrands, and the success for Mediabrands is pretty evident by the results of their performance, and he's done a great job, him and his team at UM, Initiative and all the rest of Mediabrands. Philippe's oversight role at Mediabrands is exactly that, to bring -- to make sure that we're looking at all the possibilities of collaboration and as well, Philippe has a technology background and helping in terms of new media and new technology as well. So it was exceptionally well received in -- at Mediabrands and the people. Plus frankly, Philippe has an HR responsibility, so he knows a lot of those people very well, and they work very closely together. So I can't tell you how many favorable e-mails I received from both clients as well as individuals on that move. So we're really excited about it. Marketing services, as I said, it fits very nicely into the open architecture model. I don't believe we have to own various data sources and so on, when we can rent them. But that said, we did a data analytics acquisition in Israel this year. Mediabrands has their own data sources, and when they need to use that, they have over 80 or 100 different data sources. So as long as there's partnering out there where we can rent it, we think we have to do it. We have a sufficient amount of analytics and data to make our offerings competitive, if not better, and we don't have to own it. But when there are unique opportunities out there, we make some tactical investments in it. We did it in a little -- in Samba TV, we did it in Kiip. So we look at it both ways. The key to this in the open architecture is having a vehicle without having to restructure our corporation to collaborate. And since we've been doing it for 10 years, we didn't need to restructure our entire company. We have high-priority objectives for all of our CEOs that require them to collaborate, both within their networks, as well as outside. So it's kind of interesting to see everybody jumping on this, but we started doing this 10 years ago, and it's part of our DNA. And every time there's a new thing out there in terms of -- whether it be data, whether it be content, we want to participate, and we'll do it through our partnerships, through investments or through just contractual arrangements."

And we have an extra $149 million on top of the authorization. We're not committed to doing all of it in 1 year. We'll have a normalized annual buyback throughout the year. That said, every once in a while, we're opportunistic. You saw we were a little overweighted in the fourth quarter when we saw some price pressure on our stock. So we have the flexibility. But for analytics point, if you use $300 million, I think that's a reasonable number for us to spend, and we'll be opportunistic and see how the marketplace goes. This is part of a long-term strategy. We believe that given our leverage, obviously, bringing our ratings up one more notch would be very helpful to us in that it'll give us a freer commercial paper program, which could help us in terms of the cyclicality of our cash flows. And that could free up some additional cash as well. So from an overall program point of view, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and where we are. We hope to have a commercial paper program if we get one more notch up. We have a robust return of capital on buybacks, and a 25% increase in dividend is a very nice mix between dividends and buybacks. So our overall structure in terms of return has been very well-received by the investors. Before year-end, between Frank and myself and Jerry, we've met with most of our shareholders, and this is based on the input we're getting from all of our shareholders. And as far as our leverage, we're very comfortable, and we want to be where we are heading into a market that is as volatile -- or potentially volatile as it is right now."

And it's refreshing to be able to walk into a room and put together some new ideas from a business context. And you're right; it's not just traditional advertising. It's looking into the future. We can't anticipate where consumers are going to be spending their money. And based on those insights, we can help our clients, real time, look at where they can allocate their dollars. And if it's not working, we can shift with them. We can create dashboards with our clients. We can help them do design work. We can do branding for them.

As usual, I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report a very strong performance for both the fourth quarter and full year. Among the financial highlights: Organic revenue growth was 5.2% in the quarter, which brought our organic growth to 6.1% for the full year. In 2015, we grew organically in every major region of the world and across nearly all major agencies and client sectors. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 120 basis points, marking our highest Q4 margin in at least a decade. Full year operating margin was 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points from 2014, which is at the high end of the range we targeted coming into the year. Operating profit increased 11% for the full year. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year was up 23% to $1.21 from $0.98 in 2014. That excludes a loss of $0.12 per share this year, largely noncash due to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses in the third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.66, excluding a loss of $0.03 per share from business dispositions. 
Over the last 2 years, in a very fast-changing and competitive industry, we have achieved total organic revenue growth of 12%, which is outstanding compared to our principal peers. During that 2-year span, we have also increased operating profit by 32% and comparable diluted EPS by 55%. 
All of our people can take pride in these accomplishments. Their talent, the great work they do every day on behalf of our clients are what drives such terrific results in the marketplace. We thank them for their hard work and dedication. 
Returning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5.2%. Currency had a negative 5.5% impact on revenue, while net business dispositions were a negative 20 basis points. We posted notably strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pac, U.K. and LatAm. Continental Europe remained challenged, although the region did show modest organic growth for the full year. 
Our Q4 growth reflects contributions from all major disciplines, including advertising, media, public relations. We continue to have specially strong performance from the digital services embedded across the portfolio, as well as growth at digital specialists, R/GA, Huge and MRM//McCann. 
At the agency level, a wide range of our portfolio contributed to growth, led by McCann, Mediabrands, FCB, Weber Shandwick, Golin, Octagon and FutureBrand. The top-performing client sectors in Q4 were tech and telecom, health care and financial services. 
New business was another highlight of the quarter. In media, we were pleased to add Johnson & Johnson's global buying and planning to the roster of 2015 media wins that includes U.S. responsibilities for J&J, Coca-Cola and CVS. Creative wins in the quarter included Verizon Wireless, MGM Resorts, ALDI Nord and Bank of America's retail business. As a result, our net new business was positive in Q4, as it has been through the year. 
Operating expenses were again well managed. Underneath organic growth of 5.2% in the quarter, our organic operating expense increase was 3.1%. The result was Q4 operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, operating margin expansion of 100 basis points reflects leverage on both our salaries and related and our office and general expenses. 
During Q4, we repurchased 5 million shares using $113 million. For the full year, we utilized $285 million for the repurchase of 14 million shares and our year-end share count eligible for dilution decreased 3% compared to 2014. This activity builds on a sustained capital return program that we initiated in 2011. Since that time, we've returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase, and we reduced our outstanding shares eligible for dilution by over 25%. 
In addition, on the strength of our operating results, we have announced this morning our board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.15 per share. This marks our third consecutive year of higher dividends with annual increases of 25% or more. 
We also announced that our board has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchase. Combined with $159 million remaining on our existing authorization as of the beginning of the year, this brings the total amount available for share repurchase to $459 million. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the financial and operational strength of IPG, as well as our future prospects. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. It's encouraging to see our agencies competing so successfully in the marketplace. We continue to convert growth to operating profit at a high level, and we remain committed to a disciplined use of capital that can further drive shareholder value. 
As you can see in our results today, the tone of the business remains solid through year-end in most major world regions, and we all know that marketing is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic every day due to the pace of technological innovation and shifting consumer behavior. This represents further opportunity for our company as well as our industry. Given these trends, as well as the overall strength of our offerings, we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid growth. 
There are, however, factors that require us to temper our outlook. Of course, our industry-leading results for the past 2 years sets a high bar for comparable performance in 2016. Moreover, in certain markets, macro conditions present uncertainties and even headwinds. This is true most clearly in Brazil, but also with respect to markets such as Continental Europe and the Middle East. 
There's also a concern for slowing in China. The currency environment remains volatile, which could have negative effects on clients spending. As we've said since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, the uncertainty we're all experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution. 
Notwithstanding this environment, for 2016, we are currently targeting 3% to 4% organic growth. Net acquisitions to date should add another 50 basis points to our growth in the year. It's worth noting that at current FX rates, the currency impact to our top line, as well as to our operating expenses is expected to be approximately negative 2.5% for the full year. 
Along with this level of growth, we expect to continue to build on our record operating margin expansion. We are, therefore, targeting an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement in 2016, which would bring us to at least 12%, closer to our objective of 13% operating margin or better. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective when we report back to you during our quarterly calls. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional details on our results."
108616,321989989,933174,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2%, international organic growth wa",1922,"Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see a summary of our results. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.2%. U.S. organic growth was 6.2%, international organic growth was 4.1%, with all major regions, except Continental Europe, which decreased only slightly. For the full year, all regions were up organically. Organic growth was 6.1%. 
Q4 operating margin was 20.8% compared with 19.6% a year ago. For the full year, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 11.5%, and operating profit increased 11%. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.63 and was $0.66, excluding expense of $0.03 per share for business dispositions, which is reflected pretax in our other expense line. 
Full year diluted EPS was $1.09 per share and would have been $1.21 per share, excluding business dispositions expense in Q3 and Q4, which were largely noncash. We purchased 14 million shares for $285 million during the year. As Michael mentioned, we announced this morning that our board has, once again, significantly increased our common share dividend to $0.15 per share quarterly and added $300 million to our share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting a few below-the-line items. The $12 million of expense for the dispositions of a few nonstrategic agency offices is reflected in our other expense line, below operating income. 
Our effective tax rate, adjusted for the dispositions, was 33.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% for the full year, which compares favorably to last year's adjusted tax rate. Our tax rate has been volatile from year-to-year given our operations in over 100 countries, our utilization of loss carryforwards and the requirements of a regular adjusting valuation allowances. 
In 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from the implementation of planning strategies and from the net reversal of small tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter. We expect our normalized effective rate will be in the range of 37% to 39% in 2016. It is also worth noting that our cash tax rate in 2015 was 29%. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.2 billion. Compared to Q4 '14, the impact of the change in exchange rates was a negative 5.5%, while net dispositions were a negative 20 basis points. The resulting organic increase was 5.2%. 
For the full year, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to have a significant translation impact on reported revenues and operating expenses in all international regions. Revenue growth for 2015 was, therefore, 1%, consisting of 6.1% organic growth and a positive 30 basis points from net acquisitions, while currency was a negative 5.4%. 
It's worth noting that our pass-through revenue decreased approximately $25 million organically in 2015 compared to 2014, which was an impact of 30 basis points in organic growth. Lower pass-through revenues are offset dollar-for-dollar, however, by lower O&G expense. We anticipate a similar negative pass-through impact of 30 to 50 basis points in total organic growth in 2016, which is reflected in the growth targets Michael shared earlier. 
On the bottom portion of this slide, Q4 revenue growth balanced between our IAN and CMG segments, which had growth of 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. 
For the full year, organic growth at IAN was a robust 6.7%. At CMG, organic growth was 3.6% for the year, with the important qualifier that this is where we see a disproportionately large impact from decreasing pass-through revenue on the smaller of the 2 segments. Underlying growth at CMG was high single-digit percent. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q4 organic growth was 6.2%, driven by growth from existing clients and net new business. We were led by our largest fully integrated networks, McCann and FCB, as well as by Mediabrands, R/GA and Huge. We had strong performance for PR agencies, Weber Shandwick and Golin. Among client sectors, tech and telecom and health care continue to be growth leaders. For the full year, U.S. organic growth was 6.8%, with increases across all major disciplines, with sector leadership from tech and telecom and health care. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 7% organically in Q4. We continue to see solid performance from McCann and FCB and had notable growth at Jack Morton. The U.K. organic growth was 6.6% for the full year. 
In Continental Europe, the environment for growth continued to be challenging, and our agencies' revenue change in the quarter was negative 80 basis points. In our largest markets, we had moderate growth in Germany, but that was offset by decreases in France, Spain and Italy. For the full year, organic growth for Continental Europe was a positive 1.4%. Overall, the continent represented 9% of our 2015 revenue mix. 
In Asia Pacific, our largest international region, organic revenue growth was 7.9% in Q4. That was on top of 13% growth a year ago. Among our largest national markets, we had solid increases in India, Australia and China. We had growth across most of our agencies, including Mediabrands, McCann, Mullen Lowe, Jack Morton, Weber Shandwick and R/GA. For the year, organic growth in the region was 8.3%, paced by double-digit growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
In LatAm, we grew 5.5% organically in the quarter, on top of 11% growth a year ago. We continue to see strong performance in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, along with a slight decrease in Brazil due to continued macro headwinds. Our growth in the region was led by McCann, Huge and R/GA. For the year, organic growth was 4.7%. 
In our other markets group, revenue increased 60 basis points organically on top of 12% organic growth in Q4 '14. This group is made up of Canada, the Middle East and Africa. For the year, organic growth was 4.8%, with strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.1% for calendar 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, the organic increase in our operating expenses was 3.1% compared with 5.2% organic revenue growth. Salaries and related expense decreased to 56.2% for the fourth quarter revenue compared with 54 -- 57.4% a year ago. That was mainly due to lower incentive and other performance-based expenses in the quarter. Incentive expenses were accrued at a higher level over the first 9 months this year compared to 2014 due to strong operating performance throughout the year. Base payroll, benefits and tax increased as a percentage of revenue in Q4, mainly due to the impact of currency changes. 
Office and general expenses were 23% of fourth quarter revenue this year, the same level as last year. For the full year, operating expenses increased 4.8% on an organic basis compared to organic revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Looking at the sources of operating leverage for the full year. Our ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue improved 20 basis points to 63.8% from 64% in 2014. Underneath that, base payroll, benefits and tax expense was 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.6% a year ago, but it is worth noting that this ratio would have improved by 20 basis points if not for the decrease in our pass-through revenue, which is offset in our O&G expenses. Expense for temporary labor was 3.6% of revenue for the full year in 2015 compared to 3.8% a year ago. 
Incentive expense of 3.7% of revenue for the full year compared to 3.5% in 2014, reflecting strong performance against our financial targets, almost entirely in our long-term incentive programs. Severance expense was 0.9% of revenue in 2015, the same level as a year ago. Our salary -- our other salaries and related category was 2.9% of revenue compared with 3.2% in 2014. 
Year-end headcount was approximately 49,000, an increase of 3.6%. The increases were due to hire in growth areas of our portfolio, including McCann, Mediabrands, public relations and, for digital talent, notably in support of new business wins. 
Turning to office and general expenses for the full year. O&G was 24.7% of revenue compared to 25.6% in 2014. We had operating leverage on nearly all of our O&G categories as our real estate, purchasing, shared service and IT teams continue to drive significant efficiencies. That includes 40 basis points on occupancy, 10 basis points on telecom, office supplies and travel and 50 basis points on all other O&G, which includes the benefits of lower pass-throughs. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. As the chart reflects, with the most recent data point of 11.5%, we have come a long way. There is still work to be done, and we remain highly focused on attaining our long-term goal. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on the impact of business dispositions on our diluted earnings per share. As shown here, our loss on sales of businesses was $12 million in Q4 and with minimal tax benefit, resulting in a loss of $0.03 per diluted share. 
For the full year, at right, the expense of our business sales was $50 million before tax with, again, only a small tax shield. Result was a loss of $0.12 per diluted share for the year. In sum, the adjusted EPS comparison is $1.21 per share for this year and $0.98 per share for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 10, and the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.51 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities, which compared to $1.67 billion a year ago. We returned $481 million to shareholders during the year through our share repurchase and common stock dividends. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations in 2015 was $674 million compared with $670 million a year ago. That includes $118 million used in working capital compared with $131 million a year ago. Our investing activities used $203 million in the year, including $161 million for CapEx and $29 million for acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong. While timing can shift between periods, we continue to target $150 million to $200 million annually for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $473 million in 2015, mainly $285 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $196 million in common stock dividends. In 2015, our net decrease in cash and marketable securities was $158 million. 
Slide 12 is the long view of our debt decreasing from $2.3 billion in 2007 to our current debt level of $1.76 billion at the end of 2015. 
Slide 13 shows the total of our average basic plus dilutive shares over time and at the far right's just the total as of year-end 2015. This has been an area of substantial progress, with average total shares decreasing by 125 million shares over the time period. Our starting position for 2016 is 409 million on the right. 
In summary, on Slide 14, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the year. Our teams executed very well, achieving strong revenue growth, while maintaining expense discipline. And our balance sheet continues to be a source of value creation, as evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned entering 2016. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."

Let me apologize for the granularity we're showing on the -- in this report. It is a full year report, which is why this is the time of the year where we really provide some more details, so please bear with us. I hope you'll see some of the important ins and outs in our performance for 2015. 
But from every perspective, 2015 was a very successful year, which saw us accomplish significant milestones in terms of our performance in the marketplace, as well as our financial results. 
We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our offerings, with particular emphasis on our creative and digital capabilities. We further strengthened our position as the destination of choice for the industry's top talent. 
One key element of our talent strategy is a long-standing successful commitment to diversity and inclusion. We reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs. And we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to diversity objectives. 
We began our formal programs a decade ago. Since then, we've seen dramatic improvements in the diversity of our workforce. An environment that encourage respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. 
The quality of our people and our work helped us deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth, and we further enhanced operating margin by 100 basis points. We also continued to strengthen our capital structure, achieve investment-grade status from all the major credit agencies and built on our strong shareholder return programs. 
Highlights of our performance included continued progress in McCann Worldgroup and share growth at CMG, as well as outstanding performance from Mediabrands in the midst of a historically unprecedented number of media account reviews. 
R/GA delivered its strongest financial and reputational year ever. FCB continued in the successful implementation of its turnaround plan. We, once again, saw dynamic growth from our digital special agencies and within the embedded digital capabilities across our portfolio. 
The quality of our offerings is at its highest level in well over a decade. This was evident in the recognition we received across the portfolio. We, once again, led all holding companies in AdAge A-List honors, with R/GA, McCann and Deutsche on this prestigious list and UM chosen as Media Agency of the Year, a designation it also earned from Adweek. 
Across every marketing discipline, we posted exceptional performance in the industry's most important competitions that award creativity and marketing effectiveness. Weber Shandwick and Golin won numerous PR agency of the year honors. Our health care agencies dominated the medical marketing and media awards. At Cannes, R/GA was named Agency of the Year and The Martin Agency brought home the Grand Prix in the film category. 
In terms of awards per dollar of revenue, IPG agencies' performance in Effie Awards globally led the industry, with Mullen Lowe taking both the Grand Effie and winning Agency of the Year. 
Importantly, the effectiveness of our agencies was equally apparent in consistently strong new business performance throughout the year. During 2015, McCann posted strong growth across the range of its agencies and further improved its creative profile. Management continued to build on the level of collaboration and cross-selling within Worldgroup, as well as the strong digital and accountability offerings at MRM. The agency also strengthened its already powerful position in key markets, such as India, China and Brazil. 
At CMG, our award-winning public relations agencies, Weber and Golin, continued to make -- rein market share, driven by growth from their largest clients and best-in-class digital and content market capabilities, where both firms have established positions at the forefront of their field. Octagon and Jack Morton remain leaders in their respective disciplines. 
Mediabrands was also a top-tier performer, with very strong performance in the media reviews that dominated the headlines in 2015. Having already won the U.S. J&J, Coke and CVS assignments, UM closed the year by prevailing in the global J&J consolidation and added a solid showing in the Sony review in early 2016. The organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data capabilities are playing a key role in Mediabrands' success. 
R/GA had an outstanding year, which featured strong growth as well as creative work that is recognized across all digital media, and increasingly, at traditional channels as well. The agency is also a leader in terms of innovation, not only in the agency's offerings, but also with Accelerator programs, where we incubate start-ups and share learnings with many other major clients. 
Positive momentum at FCB continued as the agency secured new assignments from leading advertisers such as InBev, Coca-Cola, Fiat Chrysler. At Cannes, FCB had its best performance ever in the arrival of a tremendously talented, new global creative leader to take the quality of the agency's product to an even greater height. 
FCB's health care offering was, once again, a top performer in its space. Mullen Lowe continued to progress. Their position as a nimble global network with a strong creative culture and contemporary hyper-bundled approach is being well-received in the marketplace. The global leadership team is aligned and energized. We are also seeing the benefits from the integration of Profero as the group's digital partner, especially in key markets such as the U.S., U.K. and China. 
Our focus on open architecture solutions, which combined the best of our talent from across the organization, was, once again, a meaningful contributor to our results. Many multiagency opportunities came into the group, domestically and internationally. The largest of these included the year's most significant holding company review in Latin America, LATAM Airlines, which we are now serving in over 20 countries, as well as J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which further underscores the value that our custom-built Wx unit delivers to this important client. And we continue to improve our delivery of integrated, multiagency solutions for existing multinationals. 
Overall, our strong performance in 2015 reflects a series of long-term strategic decisions which we back with significant investment over time. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, the open architecture model that I just discussed, as well as embedding digital experience into all our agencies. Our commitment to developing new skills, products and services and incorporating technology in all of our offerings has allowed us to stay highly relevant in the digital world. 
For the year, we also saw continued progress related to the operating and financial management of our company. First and foremost, significant improvements in profitability keep us on track to achieving our long-term goal. 
Many initiatives are fueling the strong profitability trajectory that Frank shared with you. Among them are our performance incentives put in place that are driving continued focus on leveraging our investment in base payroll and temporary labor. 
On the real estate front, our measure of square-foot per employee decreased again in 2015 by approximately 3% to 202 square feet, down from over 240 square feet a few years ago. 
In the back office, over 75% of global revenue is now on an SAP platform, most of which is supported by our shared services. This included 2,005 additions in India, China and the U.S., with plans to add our agencies in Australia and Brazil in 2016. 
Our return of capital programs also continued to positively impact results, and we've put approximately $2.5 billion towards total shareholder returns since 2011, the point in which we reinstituted these programs. 
We remain fully committed to further improving margins and building on these robust capital return programs. The latter is evident in our board's actions announced today, with our dividend increase by 25% and provided for a current authorization of approximately $460 million of share repurchase. 
We are well positioned as we move into 2016. As you've heard me say before, complexity is good because the value proposition of our portfolio of offerings is highly relevant to clients as they seek to navigate a dynamic media and marketing landscape. 
The general tone of the business remains solid. Yet, as we've seen since the start of the year, there is significant volatility in the financial markets, and we will closely monitor the impact it has on consumer sentiment. We are, therefore, approaching the year with appropriate degree of caution. 
Therefore, for 2016, we're targeting 3% to 4% organic growth and improvement of margin of 50 basis points or more. Coupled with our continued commitment to capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value. 
We thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. 
At this point, I'll open it up for questions."

They put some levels of caution in those numbers. They also put some levels of optimism in terms of to-be-generated revenue. It's not an exact science, and -- which is why, if you look at 2015, we started the year fairly conservative. And as we went through the year, we upped our guidance and we expanded our margin expectations. But the tone right now is okay. And particularly, if you look at 59% of our businesses in the United States, and although we don't see high expectations in terms of growth, 3% to 4% growth in the United States enables us to expand margin by at least 50 basis points. And that's -- to answer your other question, gives us a conversion of around close to 30%, which is what we've always said. And if you expand the organic growth, that's where you see expansion of over the 50 basis points. So the tone of the business, at least right now, is consistent. But again, given this volatility, it's something that we have to put some element of caution out there, and I think it would be irresponsible for us not to have done that. And certainly, you're seeing that by our competitors in terms of the numbers they're showing. Let me just comment. Frank mentioned it. We do build in, in our 3% to 4% some element of our pass-through in that guidance. So if you assume the 30 to 50 basis point reduction in the pass-throughs, effectively, that organic number is 3.5% to 4.5%. And let me just add that, that pass-through is a direct pass-through. It's not us taking positions with respect to digital inventory, which I'm sure will be another question. As far as the headwinds and tailwinds, we had some great wins on the media side. We did have some losses. There is a change in the tone of our business, and that is because a significant part of our business growth is coming from digital, digital business tends to be much more project-oriented. And as a result, some projects that we were able to deliver in 2015, we're not sure of repeating in 2016. So with respect to tailwinds, the tailwinds aren't as specific as we've said going into 2015. That said, we do have tailwinds, but I wouldn't equate them to as high a number as we had in 2015. But the other side of it, given our performance on the digital side, we believe our offerings are so strong that we'll see project-based business continue in 2016."

We've used up our NOL in the U.S., which is why the cash taxes have gone up. We still have over $1 billion of NOL, but that's principally over in Europe, which we can't use until those earnings take effect. So we did see some benefit there. But basically, our cash taxes are in the 29% range right now. Yes, I think it's different. Now look, first of all, let me talk about the U.K. I think what we have seen, if you compare it to 2 years ago, a turnaround in the U.K. So we're forecasting -- and as our performance this year was 7% to 8%, and we see a good, solid year for the U.K. as well going into 2016. So I think that's a -- and that's a big -- it's 9% of our business, and so therefore, that's encouraging for us going into 2016. I think Continental Europe, anecdotally, seems to be better, but I haven't met anyone who isn't concerned about Continental Europe. I was in Davos. The conversations continue to be concerned with the financial institutions in Europe, in particular, and I think that uncertainty drives our clients to be concerned. That said, it's a global economy and there's no question that our multinational clients are looking for growth markets, India, China, Latin America. Frankly, United States, we're seeing good pickup in the United States. And I think that's a little bit different than it was a couple of years ago. So there's no question that this volatility in the financial markets and in the financial institutions is giving everyone a lot of angst in terms of, whether it be access to liquidity, whether affecting the capital markets. And if I were running one of those companies, I would be looking hard at our spend, which puts an additional burden on what we have to do. I think they're not stopping spending; they're just being very careful in terms of where they spend. And that puts the burden on us to prove that what we do actually works. And if we can put together a fully integrated offering that shows how we can move the needle, it's innovative, we save some money in the process, we're effective, we're held accountable for the performance of that, then I think our clients have the money to spend, and they will do that. But they do have an element of caution in that, which is why it's still early in the year and a lot of things are happening. And let's face it, we have issues with oil, and who knows what's going to happen with the price of oil and those kind of things. So there is caution out there. But what's amazing is our business -- as I said, we're not expecting a 6% growth again. We're expecting -- we're forecasting 3% to 4%. And if we deliver 3% to 4%, we can expand margin by a healthy 50 basis points or better. And I think that's a reasonable way to go into 2016. I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but I'm just trying to be cautious in terms of what may be ahead of us. And if we're wrong, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we're putting out there."

Remember, the PR business has changed dramatically, okay? It -- what's happening is all our different disciplines are all covering all sort of aspects of the marketplace. Digital capability, social networking, social media, content, all of that is part of what we're seeing across the board in both digital and PR agencies and our traditional agencies. And as a result, Weber Shandwick, in particular, was a leader in terms of looking at their portfolio and converting to the digital and social environment, and as a result, we've seen them taking market share out there. It's because of their content and new thinking in terms of PR. So we're encouraged by that. We think they -- we have best-in-class offerings there, and we continue to see solid growth there. Frank?"

And looking at the rest of the portfolio, our sports business at Octagon, our experiential business at Jack Morton, that's very, very strong. And the CMG segment does get impacted by the decline in pass-throughs, and that's intentional. We've been trying to migrate our contracts away from being a principal, specifically, in our experiential business, to an agent. So when you look at it on a net revenue basis, our growth has been high single digits for the past 3 years. So those businesses are very, very healthy, and it's nice.

And so when we put together open architecture, whether it's Golin, whether it's Octagon, whether it's Weber Shandwick, we bring them into the open architecture model. So when we're sitting at the table and presenting the best of IPG to our clients, it includes a full array of our businesses. So our marketing services, our traditional agency businesses, our digital capabilities and our media, they're all sitting at the table. And frankly, that's what clients want to see. And the collaboration is critical to that, which is why we spend so much time on collaboration within IPG. And this open architecture model actually works. And even on -- when we're just looking at media pitches, we bring in the open architecture on media. We have different disciplines, digital, experiential, all of that comes to play in these pitches. And frankly, I'm a firm believer that's one of the reasons we've been successful in the new business arena. Because I've heard a number of clients say to me when we walked out of the room, that what was a -- it was refreshing is that they didn't know which individuals was from which discipline. And the team really spoke as one voice, and when -- they were focusing on clients. And that's makes a big difference to the clients because they don't have to worry about our silos and our issues. They're just interested in servicing their clients. And if we didn't have the marketing service arm that we have at CMG and the media and the digital capabilities and the creative capabilities at our agencies, we wouldn't be able to do that. So I'm very comfortable with that."

Philippe's oversight role at Mediabrands is exactly that, to bring -- to make sure that we're looking at all the possibilities of collaboration and as well, Philippe has a technology background and helping in terms of new media and new technology as well. So it was exceptionally well received in -- at Mediabrands and the people. Plus frankly, Philippe has an HR responsibility, so he knows a lot of those people very well, and they work very closely together. So I can't tell you how many favorable e-mails I received from both clients as well as individuals on that move. So we're really excited about it. Marketing services, as I said, it fits very nicely into the open architecture model. I don't believe we have to own various data sources and so on, when we can rent them. But that said, we did a data analytics acquisition in Israel this year. Mediabrands has their own data sources, and when they need to use that, they have over 80 or 100 different data sources. So as long as there's partnering out there where we can rent it, we think we have to do it. We have a sufficient amount of analytics and data to make our offerings competitive, if not better, and we don't have to own it. But when there are unique opportunities out there, we make some tactical investments in it. We did it in a little -- in Samba TV, we did it in Kiip. So we look at it both ways. The key to this in the open architecture is having a vehicle without having to restructure our corporation to collaborate. And since we've been doing it for 10 years, we didn't need to restructure our entire company. We have high-priority objectives for all of our CEOs that require them to collaborate, both within their networks, as well as outside. So it's kind of interesting to see everybody jumping on this, but we started doing this 10 years ago, and it's part of our DNA. And every time there's a new thing out there in terms of -- whether it be data, whether it be content, we want to participate, and we'll do it through our partnerships, through investments or through just contractual arrangements."

Well, we've been averaging close to $300 million buybacks per year. And we have an extra $149 million on top of the authorization. We're not committed to doing all of it in 1 year. We'll have a normalized annual buyback throughout the year. That said",303,"Yes. Well, we've been averaging close to $300 million buybacks per year. And we have an extra $149 million on top of the authorization. We're not committed to doing all of it in 1 year. We'll have a normalized annual buyback throughout the year. That said, every once in a while, we're opportunistic. You saw we were a little overweighted in the fourth quarter when we saw some price pressure on our stock. So we have the flexibility. But for analytics point, if you use $300 million, I think that's a reasonable number for us to spend, and we'll be opportunistic and see how the marketplace goes. This is part of a long-term strategy. We believe that given our leverage, obviously, bringing our ratings up one more notch would be very helpful to us in that it'll give us a freer commercial paper program, which could help us in terms of the cyclicality of our cash flows. And that could free up some additional cash as well. So from an overall program point of view, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and where we are. We hope to have a commercial paper program if we get one more notch up. We have a robust return of capital on buybacks, and a 25% increase in dividend is a very nice mix between dividends and buybacks. So our overall structure in terms of return has been very well-received by the investors. Before year-end, between Frank and myself and Jerry, we've met with most of our shareholders, and this is based on the input we're getting from all of our shareholders. And as far as our leverage, we're very comfortable, and we want to be where we are heading into a market that is as volatile -- or potentially volatile as it is right now."

Given the sense of confusion between what the financial markets are telling us and what you and your peers are telling us about ad spending, I wonder if there's something beyond traditional advertising or even traditional marketing services in what you are doing with your clients, i.e., are companies like IPG becoming more business services providers, providing technology and advertising and marketing services overall? And therefore, you become more embedded in your clients' budget processes and, therefore, you have a greater chance of sustaining more resilient spending beyond just what we've always called advertising and marketing services? Is that something that maybe is providing a sense of optimism amongst your clients on their spending?"

And there aren't many companies that have the capabilities we have, both in terms of typical advertising role, media planning, content distribution, digital expertise, insights, all of that put together. And frankly, what we do actually works, and we have data, and we have all sorts of information that shows that if we can bring all of these offerings together, we can, in fact, help our clients move the needle. And it's refreshing to be able to walk into a room and put together some new ideas from a business context. And you're right; it's not just traditional advertising. It's looking into the future. We can't anticipate where consumers are going to be spending their money. And based on those insights, we can help our clients, real time, look at where they can allocate their dollars. And if it's not working, we can shift with them. We can create dashboards with our clients. We can help them do design work. We can do branding for them. It really turns out to be a full-service offering that we can tap into, and it gives them a degree of comfort that they're getting cutting-edge insights without having to add 12 different disciplines coming in a room, working together. So I do believe -- and of course, we do consulting. I mean, some of our agencies have a consulting basis arm to it. So yes, our business is changing and frankly, that's why I'm bullish on our industry. For years, they've talked about our industry being disintermediated, going away. We always find a way to sustain ourselves. And I think if you look at our results, you have a pretty good indication that we're capable of doing that. So yes, I thank you for that question. 
With that said, I think those are our last questions. I really thank you for your support throughout the year. We're excited about 2016, notwithstanding some caution that we've made, and I look forward to bringing it to light. Thank you very much."

Thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter. 
I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by a Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Organic revenue growth was 6.7%, notably that comes on top of 5.7% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines, geographic regions and across most client sectors. This strong growth is consistent with our performance in recent years and a sign of the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. It's encouraging to see us start the year at the top of the competitive table in terms of growth. 
Acquisitions added another 30 basis points to growth in the quarter, while currency translation was a 3.1% drag on revenue. Reported revenue growth was therefore 3.9%. 
Q1 operating profit was $21 million compared with $8 million last year. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue, while total cost are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. 
That said, positive and sustained Q1 profit increases are yet another marker of continued strength and progress. 
During the quarter, we continue to combine our growth with effective expense discipline. We achieved leverage on expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax and our office in general expenses. The result was Q1 operating margin expansion of 70 basis points. 
Our growth this quarter continues to reflect contributions from nearly all of our major agencies, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. 
Our digital offerings continued their strong growth. This includes the range of embedded digital capabilities within our Integrated Agency Networks as well as our standalone digital specialist. Once again, this result underscores that our partnerships with clients are evolving as they look to transform their businesses in response to increasingly complex marketing landscape. 
Another contributor to our performance is our open architecture model, which we used to deliver solutions that are customized to client needs using the best of IPG solutions, notwithstanding silos. 
This reflects the growing importance of integrated communications services, something we've been focusing on for some time now. The quarter reflects strong growth with existing clients as well as new business wins. 
In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail sectors. 
Regionally, performance was notably strong in the U.S, where we had organic growth of 8.3% on top of 6.1% in Q1 of '15 and where we continue to see outstanding contributions across a very broad range of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. 
International organic growth was also strong at 4.3%, with all regions contributing. LatAm was especially notable at 11.6% organic growth. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 3.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 3.9%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 70 basis points. 
Cross discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority, and we continue to execute against that objective during the year. Our capital structure continue to be a source of value creation. 
As we announced in February, for the fourth consecutive year, our board increased our quarterly dividend by at least 25%. 
On our full year 2015 call, we also announced that our board had authorized another $300 million towards share repurchases. 
During the quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $54 million. 
More recently, we replaced on review for upgrade by Moody's and our outlook was upgraded to positive by S&P. 
Of course, we're pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. As mentioned earlier, our ability to put together integrated solutions that are customized to the needs of our clients has increasingly become a differentiator for us. As is our focus on delivering outstanding insights and creativity, and our commitment to maintaining and developing the top tier digital capabilities we have across our portfolios. We also remain focused on driving further margin expansion and capital returns. 
The strength of our offerings, coupled with operating discipline, is a winning combination that we will ensure that we continue to deliver for clients and shareholders alike. 
While Q1 is seasonably small for us and there is still macro uncertainty, particularly in certain international markets, performance to date has us well positioned to deliver on the high end of the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. 
As the year unfolds, we will, of course, keep you of our outlook as was the case in 2015. 
At this stage, I'd like to turn things over to Frank for some additional details on our results. And after his remarks, I'll be back to provide of update in our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview by results. Organic revenue growth was 6.7% in the first quarter, 8.3% in the U.S. and 4.3% in our international markets. 
Q1 operating profit was $20 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an increase of $13 million compared to last year. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is breakeven adjusted for items below our operating income and other income in our tax line. Reported diluted EPS was $0.01 per share. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses as well as below-the-line items in detail on the slides that follow. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.74 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3.9%. Compared to Q1 '15, the impact of the change in exchange rates was negative 3.1%, while net acquisitions added 30 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. 
As you can see, on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 7.6% in our integrated agency network segment, very strong performance. 
We had contributions from all disciplines, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB and Mediabrands. CMG grew 3.2% organically, led by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and Golin. CMG growth was approximately 4%, excluding the decrease in pass-through revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic revenue growth of 8.3% was broad-based across our agencies, led by R/GA, FCB, McCann and Huge. Leading client sectors were tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail. 
Turning into international markets, the U.K. grew 3.5% organically on top of 6.4% a year ago. We had notably strong growth at McCann, Mediabrands and R/GA. 
Continental Europe increased 1.7% organically. By country, we were led by strong results in Germany and modest growth in France and Spain. 
In Asia Pac, Q1 organic growth was 2.7%. We were led by very strong growth in China as well as by increases in Australia and India, while Japan decreased. 
In the region, we saw notable contributions by Mediabrands and R/GA. 
LatAm grew 11.6% organically, with strong performance driven by our agencies in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Brazil, however, remains soft due to macro headwinds. 
Our Other Markets group increased 7.4% organically, which includes strong growth in Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change in a trailing 12-month basis, the most recent data point is 6.3%. 
Moving on the Slide 7, our operating expenses. Underneath our reported revenue growth of 3.9%, total operating expenses increased 3.2% in the first quarter. Our ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue in Q1 was 73% this year compared with 72.5% a year ago. This comparison includes very strong Q1 operating leverage in our expense for base payroll benefits and tax.  It also reflects increase long-term incentive expense due to our consistently strong financial performance as well as greater expense for severance this year and increased expense for acquisition earn outs due to the strong performance of acquired businesses. 
Lower pass through revenue also shifted some operating leverage from SRS to O&G where lower pass through are offset by lower O&G expense. 
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 49,700, which is an increase of 1% from Q4 '15, reflecting investment higher barriers of the portfolio and to support our new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.8% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago. With leverage across most major expense components, notably our category of other O&G expense, which includes the benefits of lower pass through expenses. 
On Slide 8, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with most recent data point of 11.5%. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity and our year-on-year comparison with detail below-the-line items. 
Our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $16 million, mostly noncash related to the sale of small, nonstrategic agencies, mainly in Continental Europe. As a consequence of the classification of certain of these assets is held for sale, we had a net tax benefit of $12 million due to reversal valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Our tax provision also included an $8 million benefit from the adoption of new guidance on share-based compensation. The net effect on our reported results of the discrete items and loss on sale of business was a benefit of $0.01 per diluted share in the quarter. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the first quarter with $680 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal, and it tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $649 million compared with $781 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business generates significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. 
During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital is $690 million compared with $785 million a year ago. Investing activities used $59 million in the quarter, including $27 million of CapEx and $27 million for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $158 million, mainly for common stock dividend of $60 million and $54 million for share repurchases. 
Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter is $829 million compared with $926 million a year ago. 
On Slide 12, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represent a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

The effectiveness of our offerings was evident in our continued strong organic revenue growth. Across the group, whether in advertising, marketing services or media, our strategic creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. It's particularly important that most of our agencies are contributing to our strong results and that we're  seeing growth in all geographic regions. We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management and will remain focused on conversion so as to deliver or exceed on our margin improvement targets for the year. 
As you often heard me say, we're proud that IPG is become known as the destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent. Our senior corporate team has been together for some time. All of our talented people had brought the company through significant challenges to its current, very strong and competitive position. And we've done so with a high degree of integrity and humanity. 
Along with our focus on getting the best people with the right skills required to succeed in the digital world, we also have shown long-term commitment to improvement as it relates to diversity and inclusion. We were the first company in our sector to name a Chief Diversity Officer to establish diversity leaders across our major agencies within the group and interagency D&I business resource groups. And to directly tie annual incentive compensation for our major agency CEOs and senior executives to progress on diversity and inclusion. 
Driven by these programs, we've seen significant improvements over time for all minorities, they're close to 55% of our management positions currently held by women and approximately 20% by people of color, which we believe are industry-leading results. Nonetheless, we know there's still a great deal of work to do in this area. 
And uniquely, we stand by our record of taking swift and decisive action in enforcing accountability around D&I, particularly in those cases of behavior by senior executives that run counter to the kind of values for which we show our stand. 
For some time now, our investment in talent has been a key driver of IPG's success. When we supplement that with strategic acquisitions, they should ensure that we maintained a very high level of expertise and service delivery that we're seeing from so many of our agencies. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs, and we can continue to drive value-creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of our business. We continue to hear from major clients, a willingness to invest behind their brands. Our operators will also tell us that the environment for marketers remain sound overall despite uncertainty in certain important markets such as Brazil and Russia.  So there should clearly be sufficient opportunity for us to achieve toward the high end of our stated full year growth objectives. But it's still early, with only the smallest quarter in the books, so we believe it's appropriate to stay focused on our goals and measure in terms of expectations. The new business pipeline is sound. There continues to be a significant number of media pitches and consolidations though not quite at the same historically high-level as last year. 
Elsewhere in the group, our major integrated agencies are seeing solid activity as our marketing service agencies. We're active in all of the major opportunities that are out there other than those, in which we are conflicted. New business has been an area of strength for us in the past few years and an area in which collaboration has played a key role. We want to build on that performance. 
Highlights at the agency level include a strong quarter at McCann, which is winning business and recognition across a range of its companies and around the world. The focus on the part of the management team on creativity, cross utilization of services to major clients and enhancing the specialist digital experiential and health care marketing offerings is contributing to strong growth at the Worldgroup. GMD agencies continued its strong performance, led by public relations. Weber Shandwick and Golin consistently take market share and we added to their capabilities with acquisitions during Q1, provide health, we'll build on Weber's outstanding health care practice and Brooklyn Brothers will take Golin's digital content production to a new level of creativity. 
Late last week, we announced the acquisition of Spec to add a leading product design and innovation consultancy to the front-end of future brands offerings. 
At Mediabrands, we've been active on onboarding much of the new business won during last year at very competitive consolidation and pitch activity. 
The new year began with positive news for UN in the Sony review. As you've heard before, the organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and are playing a key role on Mediabrands' success and growth. 
During the quarter, we added to their capabilities with the mobile acquisition in the U.K. and we'll continue to focus on mobile, social performance, marketing and analytics going forward. 
At FCB, progress continues to be evident in the agency's results. In Chicago, the agency further built on its Kia Fiat Chrysler lines, while FCB Inferno won additional BMW business in Europe. 
And earlier this week, prevailed in a highly competitive U.K. pitch for npower. 
FCB Health is a consistently strong contributor and the new management team has been put in place in New York, while a dynamic new leader joined us North American President of the hacker agency, an outstanding CRM agency that's part of the FCB group. 
Mullen Lowe Group is increasingly active in new businesses with wins from Hyatt hotels, Etihad Airways and the number of other opportunities that are not public but in which they are among the finalists in significant reviews. 
The agency announced new leader for its Boston office who joins us after a long and successful stint as CMO at Converse. Mullen Lowe was also named the world's best creative agency at the Wark 100 Awards and topped a good report for 2015, Best Campaign for Social Responsibility. R/GA, Huge, and MRM posted very strong start to the year in terms of of the highly innovation work they're doing for the clients, their financial performance and the recognition they're garnering in the marketplace is significant. R/GA has been pioneering what it means to be a digital marketer since the beginning of the connected age. The company continues to be honored as one of the industry's top agencies. 
Growth at Huge has been significant and the agency recently names it first Chief Creative Officer. 
MRM remains one of the industry's top global networks, powering the digital business for many of the world's largest brands. 
As you know, we've been clear for many years that the changing dynamics of media usage and behavior, both for an integrated strategy when it comes to digital. Not to the highly siloed approach taken by some of our peers. The benefits of investing in talent and embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as we've been doing for some time continues to be evident in IPG's strong organic revenue performance. 
Of course, being able to combine these embedded digital offerings with our specialty agencies is even more powerful. And just another example how we mix and match the right capabilities and talent on all of our client engagements. We're pleased with the strong performance in Q1 with a very high caliber of our people and with the effectiveness of our capabilities. We continue to see some geographic markets where macro concerns will require monitoring. It's also work repeating that our Q1 is always our lightest this quarter. We will, of course, remain vigilant on cost and the appropriate level of margin conversion. 
Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on the high end of a full year target of organic growth of 3% to 4% and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
And as always, I thank you for your time and support, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year.

If we continue to focus on treating our existing clients as if it was a pitch, there's opportunity to meet their needs in the marketplace given the talent and resources that we have. And that will be continued focus on all of our organizations to treat our existing clients with that type of opportunity and commitment to meeting their needs. And if you add on top of that, net-net business wins from pitches, obviously, that gives you right through our results. Now coming into the year, obviously, we had some tailwinds as a result of the net new business. We see that rolling out more on the first half of the year, so let's assume there's about 150 basis points of tailwinds coming into the first half of the year. And in the back half of the year, that will slow down. So a combination of focusing on our existing clients and keeping the back to our close, winning when we are involved in pitches and focusing on our open architecture model is what makes us comfortable with our forecast going into the year."

And obviously, with these kind of results, we're not relying on one particular agency. And as you know, well, you were there from the beginning, this has been a journey in terms of repositioning our people and our organizations. And I've said this publicly and privately, I've never been more comfortable with the leadership of our organization throughout all of our agencies than I am right now. Our most recent repositioning involved putting Mullen and Lowe together to form the Mullen Lowe Group and I'm very pleased with how that's come out of the box in terms of new business wins and servicing their existing clients. So when you combine 3 global networks of Mullen Lowe, McCann and FCB on top of all the independent agencies we have in the U.S., some of them are not performing where we would like them to be. And of course, Mullen Lowe has a ways to go before they're achieving the levels of the McCann our FCB. And frankly, that's the opportunity we have at IPG. Our media offerings continue to be best-in-class, they're recognized, obviously, UN in terms of its agency, year awards , and its positive results of new business. Weber Shandwick and Golin being top of the charts in terms of winning and gaining share. And certainly, Weber winning all the recognition awards, our sports marketing and our experiential, so I'm very pleased with all of our offerings. That doesn't mean to say we can't refine that in terms of adding additional talent and go-to-market strategies and acquisitions and given our financial position, we're in a position to do that. So I'm feeling -- what we told the team this morning, we're not spiking any football. This is still a journey. We still have margin improvement that's available to us, and that's what we're focusing on. But in the meantime, I have no doubt that if there's -- there's an opportunity for us to pitch business, we will put together a world-class opportunity and team in place, and we will continue to focus on our existing client base, which is among the best in the world. So other than that, I'm pretty  feeling -- pretty comfortable about where we stand."

If you look at companies with your revenue mix out of international, you tend to see tax rates sort of the low-30s and I know you guys are driving margins and trying to drive profitability, particularly in your European agencies. I guess, if you could just think about the long-term. Do you see an opportunity for IPG to get its blended tax rate down? Because that would be a pretty meaningful EPS driver, if that opportunity was there for you and sort of the investable future. I'll just ask my second one. Your incentive comp as a percent of revenue, I think, is the highest it's been in a number of years. And I'm guessing that reflects your confidence in the year. I don't know, maybe you can spend just a minute on how you guys accrue during the year, Q1 as you said is small, but it seems to be an indication of where you see the year coming in versus what your internal budgets might have been. So those are my 2 questions."

On incentive comp, it's a little over 4% in the first quarter. And really what that is a long-term incentive plan. Given the performance that we've had in the last couple of years and since our long-term performance is based on performance operation, it's encouraging to see that, that number is higher because it's reflective of our positive results. Over the year, we're still using a 3.5% number in terms of total incentive comp. So it does hit us a little bit stronger in the first quarter. And then of course, when you compare to light revenue in the first quarter, it magnifies the percentage of its impact. So this is all part of the plan. This wasn't a surprise. We know well that we are performing well in our incentive plan. Frankly, our incentive plans are working exactly as they should be. We have short term plan that focus on both the agencies as well as overall performance and long-term incentives that look to what we need to drive, continue consistent performance across the organization. So I think just look at that as a sort of one-off in the first quarter, which is actually positive results given the performance that we've had. Actually, there's a whole complicated situation. As you know, we have $1 billion greater NOL, and that's principally in Europe. And in order for us to use that NOL, we have to generate income in those geographic areas. And we focus very -- we have a great international tax department that focuses on optimizing utilization of the NOL, which gets into, of course, agreements between countries in terms of allocations, and so on. And we try to optimize it. But when we do have write-offs in foreign jurisdictions, unless there is income that we can use those write-offs against, we don't get the benefit that we were looking for, we do release some reserves, which we saw the reversals in the first quarter. So we have a 28% to 30% cash tax rate, which we're using, which frankly is attractive versus our financial tax rate, which is 37% to 39% to 40%. So we still have a difference between cash versus book. We're very focused on utilization the cash on well. In the U.S., we used up our cash on well, so what we rely on in the U.S. is good old-fashioned U.S. tax planning. We have a great tax department that focuses on that. So I do think that our NOL is unaccounted for, asset on our balance sheet but we can't benefit until we generate profitability. And since Continental Europe, as you know, we did have positive results in Continental Europe this quarter, which is -- that's the second at least second or third quarter in a row that we've been positive, not by a lot, but it beats the losses we've been having. So that's encouraging. But I do think there's opportunities, but we're not prepared to commit to a significantly lower cash taxes as a result of it."

And we're thrilled to see the amount of leverage we get out of it, and it's an area that we've been focused on for years, and we'll continue to focus on. How do you take that fixed component of our employee base, plus by fact they're temporary labor with service clients and get more leverage out of we're seeing it. With respect to the other components of SRS Michael just commented on, on the incentive component and to the earlier question, we didn't adjust our annual incentive accrual at all in the first quarter. So we booked at a budget. So all of that increase is related to the long-term. And on the severance, we had some incremental severance in Europe, and we had some severance at a specific agency.

In terms if you're looking at the quality of our earnings in the first quarter, if you take off  the one off -- take off the one off items, obviously, the quality of our earnings is very solid and the EPS number is not really reflected of the type of performance we had in the first quarter. You always have risk in a quarter basis going forward, but I don't believe we have any significant items that we already know about that will hit in that way. The good news is we had the acquisition adjustment in terms of the performance. By the way, if w e have it going through the rest of the year, that the summer acquisitions or even performing better than we thought. So that won't be a bad thing. So I think, hopefully, we won't have the noise, if you will, on below-the-line going forward for the rest of the year. My tone and my language is still it's cautionary because there's still a lot of stuff going out there. But I did say at the end of the year when we talk about the caution that we didn't see any specific areas of caution, but there are a lot of noise. If you look at Latin America, that's a great example. Obviously, Brazil is an issue. And frankly, if you look at our organic growth in Latin America was over 11%. That's -- notwithstanding the fact that Brazil was breakeven. And there, in Latin America, we had very strong results from our digital, whether it be R/GA, whether it be Huge, whether it be our media offerings, in McCann in Latin America. So we had very positive results, notwithstanding the fact that Brazil, which is a large market for us, has significant risk in terms of what's going on there. Obviously, the government transitions there are an issue. So that causes us to be some concern in terms of what's happening there. In terms of the good news on the U.S. side is we're now 63% of our business, being in the U.S. versus the end of the year, we were at 60%. That should be an indication of the strength of our offerings in the United States across the board. PR, media, advertising, digital, experiential and sports marketing, all of them in the United States are performing well, which is one of the reasons you see a 63% number. And we don't need -- if you look at the forecast for U.S. media and media overall, we're still in the 3% to 4% ad spend in the U.S. and globally, which is another reason why we're somewhat cautious in terms of what the organic number we're putting out there. Asia Pac continues in China, India, Australia. Overall, perform -- China, we had double-digit growth. So we have very solid offerings. India was single-digit growth, but last year, we had very strong comps that we had a goal against. Australia continues to perform. Japan was slightly weak. So that causes us -- there's a lot of noise going on about China, but our results don't yet reflect this, so we have to be cautious about that. And then you go to Europe and the U.K. results were slightly off of where we were before, and that is attributable to one -- some of our onetime items that were not as strong as they work, particularly in the U.K. Continental Europe, again, it's not significant us, it's what? 8%, and so 1 or 2 items can affect that, and we're still cautious about Continental Europe. And what's going to happen with [indiscernible], we don't know. So there has to be some level of caution, but you have to look at our results and say, wait a minute, obviously our clients are spending, and we continue to see that. So that's the reason we still have some caution out there. And like I said, we're not spiking any football, but we're not just managing our existing clients. That's why it's so important to manage our existing client base. And that's our strategy as we go forward."

We have many others as well, and we have hundreds of different data sources that we use in our analytics and Samba TV was just a unique proposition, particularly on the TV side that we felt added some additional credibility and insights for us. And we continue to look at these types of tech and data insight companies to help us provide value to our clients."

What's happening on the digital side of the business, our goal is obviously have agency record in. What's encouraging is we do have longer standing relationships with our special digital agencies that is somewhat different than it used to be in the business, which is very encouraging. But still a significant portion of our digital practice is more or less on a project basis. And now, I think the definition of project-based is changing a little bit on the digital side. We have relationships with clients and their spend vary based on projects within it. We still have the clients, and so, for example, we're seeing comp -- a return of some clients that we have relationships with that may have not spent as much money last year, but we're starting to see the spend come back this year. So I characterize that as sort of project business, and I think we have to deal with that more in the environment today because digital is such a significant part of both our growth and the offerings we have with our clients. So as long as we deliver the best-in-class offerings, and we have the talent and the people, look, we've been living with a PR business that is more than 50% on somewhat on a project basis, and we continue to perform. So it doesn't scare us. I think it's an opportunity, but it is a characterization of that business that you have to be sensitive to."

I don't have the numbers, I'm not sure whether you do, but if that intuition is right, I mean, what do you think would be driving the increasing spending with you as a service provider relative to the sizes of their business because I think that might reflect somewhat on the place of the agency in the value chain over the longer-term as well as obviously some great near-term strength. And then my follow up was just any major pitches that you would call out in the market right now, either opportunities or any potential defenses which you would just have a focus on?"
108616,330038525,961705,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

Look, obviously, our client base strength are large multinational clients that have significant advertising dollars and marketing dollars. And our goal is always be to give them the best offerings we have and not just one discipline. The health of a client relationship is that we're bringing multiple services to the table, and that's truly what the integrated offering is all about. And what's encouraging is that when you look at our top 20 clients, we have multiple disciplines servicing those clients, and that's what gives rise to that type of organic growth. So you could take a bigger share of wallet from a particular client even though their spend may not be going up. If you're bringing in PR, if you're bringing in experiential, if you're bringing in media. So that represents the strength of opportunities with our existing clients, and that's why I'm so pleased with those type of results. And it is so important, therefore, to keep the back door closed in terms of servicing clients, and that's what this business is about. We have to add value to our clients, and it's not just one-off in terms of it. We have relationships with a client that have lasted 50 years and of course, those relationships go up and down like everything else, and we have to make sure that we're bringing the best ideas and talent to the table, and that's why our management teams have been doing so well, and that's why we're seeing the results that we're seeing. And that bodes well for -- frankly not just us, but our industry. Everyone thinks that we're being disintermediated with all these add tax and other services that are out there, but if we're properly servicing our clients and bringing in all the talents and insights that we can bring, we're not going to get disintermediated. In fact, we see this as an opportunity. So I think, so far, our results are reflective of that. On the pitch side, consistent to what we said before. The Army, which is McCann, they have a statutory review that we've actually extended. The last time we defended the Army was, I believe, in 2011, and it's been extended through 2017. So great work, both on the media side as well as the PR side and the advertising side. And obviously, we continue to great work to clients and since this is a normal review, we're not taking it lightly, but we believe we have a good chance of continuing. On the media side, BMW is, I think, the one pitch that's still remaining, that commenced last year and it's running into 2016 on the media side and UM has serviced the account. We've won actually some one-offs in the meantime in some foreign locations, so we're encouraged to see that. So again, that one is still out there. Fiat from Mullen Lowe is a review that was driven by procurement. So there, too, it's a mandatory procurement review. It's not that we're having trouble with a client, it's putting us at risk or -- it's a review. But every time there's a review, there's a risk. So those are the only big 3 that I believe are out there of note. There are a number of media reviews out there that what we view is upside. That means we're not defending, but we're participating in and it's public, so I can mention it. That's that 21st Century Fox and Volkswagen. Those 2-- we have -- we're participating in those reviews, and we hope to see some positive outcome from that. But again, it's all upside. And I think those are the major ones that I'll call out right now."

And frankly, they're doing a tremendous job. We have lower cost, excellent talent, very strong results, 24/7, and it would be wrong for us not to take advantage of locating those type of facilities in those type of countries. It's not outsourcing in that, it's our people that are doing it, so it's not that we're using third parties to do it or we're locating our people in those geographic regions, particularly in Latin America, we're seeing very good results with it.

I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by a Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Organic revenue growth was 6.7%. Notably, that comes on top of 5.7% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines, geographic regions and across most client sectors. This strong growth is consistent with our performance in recent years and a sign of the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. It's encouraging to see us start the year at the top of the competitive table in terms of growth. 
Acquisitions added another 30 basis points to growth in the quarter, while currency translation was a 3.1% drag on revenue. Reported revenue growth was therefore 3.9%. 
Q1 operating profit was $21 million compared with $8 million last year. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue, while total costs are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. That said, positive and sustained Q1 profit increases are yet another marker of continued strength and progress. 
During the quarter, we continued to combine our growth with effective expense discipline. We achieved leverage on our expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax and our office and general expenses. The result was Q1 operating margin expansion of 70 basis points. 
Our growth this quarter continues to reflect contributions from nearly all of our major agencies, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. 
Our digital offerings continued their strong growth. This includes the range of embedded digital capabilities within our Integrated Agency Networks as well as our stand-alone digital specialists. Once again, this result underscores that our partnerships with clients are evolving as they look to transform their businesses in response to an increasingly complex marketing landscape. 
Another contributor to our performance is our open architecture model, which we use to deliver solutions that are customized to client needs using the best of IPG solutions, notwithstanding silos. 
This reflects the growing importance of integrated communications services, something we have been focusing on for some time now. The quarter reflects strong growth with the existing clients as well as new business wins. 
In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail sectors. 
Regionally, performance was notably strong in the U.S., where we had organic growth of 8.3% on top of 6.1% in Q1 of '15 and where we continue to see outstanding contributions across a very broad range of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. 
International organic growth was also strong at 4.3%, with all regions contributing. LatAm was especially notable at 11.6% organic growth. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 3.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 3.9%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 70 basis points. 
Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority, and we continue to execute against that objective during the year. Our capital structure continue to be a source of value creation. 
As we announced in February, for the fourth consecutive year, our board increased our quarterly dividend by at least 25%. On our full year 2015 call, we also announced that our board had authorized another $300 million towards share repurchases. During the quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $54 million. 
More recently, we were placed on review for upgrade by Moody's, and our outlook was upgraded to positive by S&P. 
Of course, we're pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. As mentioned earlier, our ability to put together integrated solutions that are customized for the needs of our clients has increasingly become a differentiator for us, as is our focus on delivering outstanding insights and creativity and our commitment to maintaining and developing the top-tier digital capabilities we have across our portfolios. We also remain focused on driving further margin expansion and capital returns. 
The strength of our offerings, coupled with operating discipline, is a winning combination that we will ensure that we continue to deliver for clients and shareholders alike. 
While Q1 is seasonably small for us and there is still macro uncertainty, particularly in certain international markets, performance to date has us well positioned to deliver on the high end of the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. As the year unfolds, we will, of course, keep you apprised of our outlook, as was the case in 2015. 
At this stage, I'd like to turn things over to Frank for some additional detail on our results. And after his remarks, I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview by results. Organic revenue growth was 6.7% in the first quarter, 8.3% in the U.S. and 4.3% in our international markets. 
Q1 operating profit was $20 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an increase of $13 million compared to last year. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is breakeven, adjusted for items below our operating income and other income in our tax line. Reported diluted EPS was $0.01 per share. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses as well as below-the-line items in detail on the slides that follow. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.74 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3.9%. Compared to Q1 '15, the impact of a change in exchange rates was negative 3.1%, while net acquisitions added 30 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. 
As you can see, on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 7.6% at our Integrated Agency Networks segment, very strong performance. 
We had contributions from all disciplines, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB and Mediabrands. CMG grew 3.2% organically, led by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and Golin. CMG growth was approximately 4%, excluding a decrease in pass-through revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic revenue growth of 8.3% was broad-based across our agencies, led by R/GA, FCB, McCann and Huge. Leading client sectors were tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 3.5% organically on top of 6.4% a year ago. We had notably strong growth at McCann, Mediabrands and R/GA. 
Continental Europe increased 1.7% organically. By country, we were led by strong results in Germany and modest growth in France and Spain. 
In Asia Pac, Q1 organic growth was 2.7%. We were led by very strong growth in China as well as by increases in Australia and India, while Japan decreased. In the region, we saw notable contributions by Mediabrands and R/GA. 
LatAm grew 11.6% organically, with strong performance driven by our agencies in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Brazil, however, remained soft due to macro headwinds. 
Our Other Markets group increased 7.4% organically, which includes strong growth in Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of organic revenue change in a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. Underneath our reported revenue growth of 3.9%, total operating expenses increased 3.2% in the first quarter. Our ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue in Q1 was 73% this year compared with 72.5% a year ago. This comparison includes very strong Q1 operating leverage and our expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax. It also reflects increased long-term incentive expense due to our consistently strong financial performance as well as greater expense for severance this year and increased expense for acquisition earnouts due to the strong performance of acquired businesses. 
Lower pass-through revenue also shifted some operating leverage from SRS to O&G where lower pass-throughs are offset by lower O&G expense. 
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 49,700, which is an increase of 1% from Q4 '15, reflecting investment in higher-growth areas of the portfolio and to support our new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.8% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago, with leverage across most major expense components, notably our category of other O&G expense, which includes the benefits of lower pass-through expenses. 
On Slide 8, we share our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis, with the most recent data point of 11.5%. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity and our year-on-year comparison with detail on below-the-line items. 
Our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $16 million, mostly noncash related to the sale of small, nonstrategic agencies mainly in Continental Europe. As a consequence of the classification of certain of these assets as held for sale, we had a net tax benefit of $12 million due to reversal of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. 
Our tax provision also included an $8 million benefit from the adoption of new guidance on share-based compensation. The net effect on our reported results of the discrete items and the loss on sale of business was a benefit of $0.01 per diluted share in the quarter. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the first quarter with $680 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal, and it tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $649 million compared with $781 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business generates significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. 
During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital is $690 million compared with $785 million a year ago. Investing activities used $59 million in the quarter, including $27 million of CapEx and $27 million for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $158 million, mainly for common stock dividend of $60 million and $54 million for share repurchases. 
Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter is $829 million compared with $926 million a year ago. 
On Slide 12, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

As you've often heard me say, we're proud that IPG has become known as the destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent. Our senior corporate team has been together for some time. All of our talented people have brought the company through significant challenges to its current, very strong and competitive position. And we've done so with a high degree of integrity and humanity. 
Along with our focus on getting the best people with the right skills required to succeed in the digital world, we also have shown a long-term commitment to improvement as it relates to diversity and inclusion. We were the first company in our sector to name a chief diversity officer to establish diversity leaders across our major agencies within the group and interagency D&I business resource groups and to directly tie annual incentive compensation for our major agency CEOs and senior executives to progress on diversity and inclusion. 
Driven by these programs, we've seen significant improvements over time for all minorities, with close to 55% of our management positions currently held by women and approximately 20% by people of color, which we believe are industry-leading results. Nonetheless, we know there is still a great deal of work to do in this area. And uniquely, we stand by our record of taking swift and decisive action in enforcing accountability around D&I, particularly in those cases of behavior by senior executives that run counter to the kind of values for which we should all stand. 
For some time now, our investment in talent has been a key driver of IPG's success. When we supplement that with strategic acquisitions, they should ensure that we maintain the very high level of expertise and service delivery that we're seeing from so many of our agencies. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs, and we can continue to drive value creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of our business. We continue to hear from major clients a willingness to invest behind their brands. Our operators also tell us that the environment for marketers remain sound overall despite uncertainty in certain important markets, such as Brazil and Russia. So there should clearly be sufficient opportunity for us to achieve toward the high end of our stated full year growth objectives. 
But it's still early, with only the smallest quarter in the books. So we believe it's appropriate to stay focused on our goals and measured in terms of expectations. The new business pipeline is sound. There continues to be a significant number of media pitches and consolidations though not quite at the same historically high level as last year. 
Elsewhere in the group, our major integrated agencies are seeing solid activity, as our marketing service agencies. We're active in all of the major opportunities that are out there other than those on which we are conflicted. New business has been an area of strength for us in the past few years and an area in which collaboration has played a key role. We want to build on that performance. 
Highlights at the agency level include a strong quarter at McCann, which is winning business and recognition across a range of its companies and around the world. The focus on the part of the management team on creativity, cross-utilization of services to major clients and enhancing the specialists' digital, experiential and health care marketing offerings is contributing to strong growth at the Worldgroup. 
CMG agencies continued its strong performance, led by public relations. 
Weber Shandwick and Golin consistently take market share, and we added to their capabilities with acquisitions during Q1. ReviveHealth will build on Weber's outstanding health care practice, and Brooklyn Brothers will take Golin's digital content production to a new level of creativity. 
Late last week, we announced the acquisition of Speck to add a leading product design and innovation consultancy to the front end of FutureBrand's offerings. 
At Mediabrands, we have been active on onboarding much of the new business won during last year's very competitive consolidation and pitch activity. 
The new year began with positive news for UM in the Sony review. As you've heard before, the organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data are playing a key role on Mediabrands' success and growth. 
During the quarter, we added to their capabilities with a mobile acquisition in the U.K., and we'll continue to focus on mobile, social performance, marketing and analytics going forward. 
At FCB, progress continued to be evident in the agency's results. In Chicago, the agency further built on its Fiat Chrysler assignments, while FCB Inferno won additional BMW business in Europe and, earlier this week, prevailed in a highly competitive U.K. pitch for npower. 
FCB Health is a consistently strong contributor. And a new management team has been put in place in New York, while a dynamic new leader joined as North American president of the HackerAgency, an outstanding CRM agency that's part of the FCB Group. 
MullenLowe Group is increasingly active in new businesses, with wins from Hyatt Hotels, Etihad Airways and a number of other opportunities that are not public but in which they are among the finalists in significant reviews. The agency announced a new leader for its Boston office, who joins us after a long and successful stint as CMO at Converse. 
MullenLowe was also named the world's best creative agency at the Warc 100 awards and topped the Good Report for 2015's best campaigns for social responsibility. 
R/GA, Huge and MRM posted very strong starts to the year. In terms of the highly innovative work they are doing for clients, their financial performance and the recognition they are garnering in the marketplace is significant. R/GA has been pioneering what it means to be a digital marketer since the beginning of the connected age. The company continues to be honored as one of the industry's top agencies. 
Growth at Huge has been significant, and the agency recently named its first chief creative officer. 
MRM remains one of the industry's top global networks, powering the digital business for many of the world's largest brands. 
As you know, we've been clear for many years that the changing dynamics of media usage and behavior bode for an integrated strategy when it comes to digital, not to the highly siloed approach taken by some of our peers. The benefits of investing in talent and embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio, as we've been doing for some time, continues to be evident in IPG's strong organic revenue performance. 
Of course, being able to combine these embedded digital offerings with our specialty agencies is even more powerful and just another example of how we mix and match the right capabilities and talent on all of our client engagements. 
We're pleased with the strong performance in Q1 with a very high caliber of our people and with the effectiveness of our capabilities. We continue to see some geographic markets where macro concerns will require monitoring. It's also worth repeating that Q1 is always our lightest quarter. We will, of course, remain vigilant on costs and the appropriate level of margin conversion. 
Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on the high end of a full year target of organic growth of 3% to 4% and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
And as always, I thank you for your time and support, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year. 
With that, I will now open it up for Q&A."

I think a significant part of our results is an indication that of our top 20 clients, our organic growth was close to 12%. Now that's a significant number, and it's something that reflects what we've been saying now for many years. If we continue to focus on treating our existing clients as if it was a pitch, there's opportunity to meet their needs in the marketplace given the talent and resources that we have. And that will be continued focus on all of our organizations, to treat our existing clients with that type of opportunity and commitment to meeting their needs. And if you add on top of that net business wins from pitches, obviously, that gets right through our results. Now coming into the year, obviously, we had some tailwinds as a result of the net new business. We see that rolling out more on the first half of the year. So let's assume there's about 150 basis points of tailwinds coming into the first half of the year, and in the back half of the year, that will slow down. So a combination of focusing on our existing clients and keeping the back door closed, winning when we are involved in pitches and focusing on our open architecture model is what makes us comfortable with our forecast going into the year."

And obviously, with this kind of results, we're not relying on one particular agency. And as you know, well, you were there with us from the beginning, this has been a journey in terms of repositioning our people and our organizations. And I've said this publicly and privately, I've never been more comfortable with the leadership of our organizations throughout all of our agencies than I am right now. Our most recent repositioning involved putting Mullen and Lowe together to form the MullenLowe Group, and I'm very pleased with how that's come out of the box in terms of new business wins and servicing their existing clients. So when you combine 3 global networks of MullenLowe, McCann and FCB on top of all the independent agencies we have in the U.S., some of them are not performing where we would like them to be. And of course, MullenLowe has a ways to go before they're achieving the levels of a McCann or an FCB. And frankly, that's the opportunity we have at IPG. Our media offerings continue to be best in class. They're recognized, obviously, UM in terms of its agency, the year awards and its positive results of new business, Weber Shandwick and Golin being top of the charts in terms of winning and gaining market share and certainly Weber winning all the recognition awards, our sports marketing and our experiential. So I'm very pleased with all of our offerings. That doesn't mean to say we can't refine that in terms of adding additional talent and go-to-market strategies and acquisitions. And given our financial position, we're in a position to do that. So I'm feeling -- what we told the team this morning, we're not spiking any football. This is still a journey. We still have margin improvement that's available to us, and that's what we're focusing on. But in the meantime, I have no doubt that if there's a -- there's an opportunity for us to pitch business, we will put together a world-class opportunity and team in place, and we will continue to focus on our existing client base, which is among the best in the world. So other than that, I'm pretty feeling -- feeling pretty comfortable about where we stand."

And I know, Michael, you like to talk about taxes as much as [indiscernible] there. If you look at companies with your revenue mix, out of international, you tend to see tax rates sort of in the low 30s, and I know you guys are driving margins and trying to drive profitability, particularly in your European agencies. I guess if you could just think about the long term, do you see an opportunity for IPG to get its blended tax rate down? Because that would be a pretty meaningful EPS driver if that opportunity was there for you in sort of the investable future. And I'll just ask my second one. Your incentive comp as a percent of revenue, I think, was the highest it's been at least in a number of years. And I'm guessing that reflects your confidence in the year. I don't know, maybe you can spend just a minute on how you guys accrue during the year. Q1, as you said, is small, but it seems to be an indication of where you see the year coming in versus what your internal budgets might have been. So those are my 2 questions."

On the incentive comp, it's a little over 4% in the first quarter. And really, what that is, is our long-term incentive plan. Given the performance that we've had in the last couple of years and since our long-term performance is based on performance of operations, it's encouraging to see that, that number is higher because it's reflective of our positive results. Over the year, we're still using a 3.5% number in terms of total incentive comp. So it does hit us a little stronger in the first quarter. And then of course, when you compare it to light revenue in the first quarter, it magnifies the percentage of its impact. So this is all part of a plan. This wasn't a surprise. We know well that we're performing well in our incentive plans. Frankly, our incentive plans are working exactly as they should be. We have short-term plans that focus on both the agencies as well as overall performance and long-term incentives that look to what we need to drive, continue consistent performance across the organization. So I think just look at that as a sort of one-off in the first quarter, which was actually a positive result given the performance that we've had. Tax is a whole complicated situation. As you know, we have $1 billion greater NOL, and that's principally in Europe. And in order for us to use that NOL, we have to generate income in those geographic areas. And we focus very -- we have a great international tax department that focuses on optimizing utilization of the NOL, which gets into, of course, agreements between countries in terms of allocations and so on. And we try to optimize it. But when we do have write-offs in foreign jurisdictions, unless there is income that we can use those write-offs against, we don't get the benefit that we were looking for, we do release some reserves which we saw the reversals in the first quarter. So we have a 28% to 30% cash tax rate, which we're using, which, frankly, is attractive versus our financial tax rate, which is 37% to 39% or 40%. So we still have a difference between cash versus book, and we're very focused on utilization of the cash NOL. In the U.S., we used up our cash NOLs, so what we rely on in the U.S. is good old-fashioned U.S. tax planning. We have a great tax department that focuses on that. So I do think that our NOL is an unaccounted-for asset on our balance sheet, but we can't benefit until we generate profitability. And since Continental Europe -- as you know, we did have positive results in Continental Europe this quarter, which is -- that's the second -- I don't know, at least second or third quarter in a row that we've been positive, not by a lot, but it beats the losses we've been having. So that's encouraging. But I do think there's opportunities, but we're not prepared to commit to a significantly lower cash tax as a result of it."

How do you take that fixed component of our employee base plus by, frankly, our temporary labor with service clients and get more leverage out of it? We're seeing it.

So we booked at a budget. So all of that increase is related to the long term. And on the severance, we had some incremental severance in Europe, and we had some severance at a specific agency.

Michael, could you please elaborate a bit more on your comment on the state of the market? It seemed just last quarter, it was kind of nervous times, and financial markets were volatile, and there were a lot of macro issues, and you expressed some caution at the time. And now your comments seem to be that clients are spending steadily, and financial markets have picked up, and the early statistics [ph] have picked up. And I just wonder what your -- if we can give a bit more color on the state of client spending and client thinking in terms of investing in marketing. We've also seen some pretty good results or comments this reporting season from the likes of retailers and credit card issuers and so on, so it just seems like it feels even better now. And then just a quick housekeeping, I guess. Is there anything we need to know in terms of one-off below the line that -- I mean, it's small items, but they brought your EPS down by $0.01 in Q1. So anything ongoing, the size of the adjustment or anything else that we need to know about in the coming quarters?"

And in terms of if you're looking at the quality of our earnings in the first quarter, if you take off the one-off -- if you take out the one-off items, obviously, the quality of our earnings is very sol",710,"No. The one-off items, I think that's a fair point. And in terms of if you're looking at the quality of our earnings in the first quarter, if you take off the one-off -- if you take out the one-off items, obviously, the quality of our earnings is very solid, and the EPS number is not really reflective of the type of performance we had in the first quarter. You always have risk in a quarter basis going forward, but I don't believe we have any significant items that we already know about that will hit in that way. The good news is we had the acquisition adjustment in terms of the performance. By the way, if we have it going through the rest of the year, that means our acquisitions have been performing better than we thought. So that won't be a bad thing. So I think hopefully, we won't have the noise, if you will, on below the line going forward for the rest of the year. My tone and my language is still it's cautionary because there's still a lot of stuff going out there. And -- but I did say at the end of the year when we talked about the caution that we didn't see any specific areas of caution, but there were a lot of noise. If you look at Latin America, that's a great example. Obviously, Brazil is an issue. And frankly, if you look at -- our organic growth in Latin America was over 11%. That's -- notwithstanding the fact that Brazil was break-even. And there, in Latin America, we had very strong results from our digital, whether it be R/GA, whether it be Huge, whether it be our media offerings in McCann in Latin America. So we had very positive results, notwithstanding the fact that Brazil, which is a large market for us, has significant risk in terms of what's going on there. Obviously, the government transitions there are an issue. So that causes us to be somewhat concerned in terms of what's happening there. In terms of -- the good news on the U.S. side is we're now 63% of our business being in the U.S. versus the end of the year, we were at 60%. That should be an indication of the strength of our offerings in the United States across the board. PR, media, advertising, digital, experiential and sports marketing, all of them in the United States are performing well, which is one of the reasons you see a 63% number. And we don't need -- if you look at the forecast for U.S. media and media overall, we're still in the 3% to 4% ad spend in the U.S. and globally, which is another reason why we're somewhat cautious in terms of what the organic number we're putting out there. Asia Pac continues -- China, India, Australia are all perform -- China, we had double-digit growth. So we have very solid offerings. India with single-digit growth, but last year, we had very strong comps that we had to go against. Australia continues to perform. Japan was slightly weak. So that causes us -- there's a lot of noise going on about China, but our results don't yet reflect this, so we have to be cautious about that. And then you go to Europe. And the U.K. results were slightly off of where we were before, and that is attributable to one -- some of our onetime items that were not as strong as they were, particularly in the U.K. Continental Europe, again, it's not significant to us. It's, what, 8%? And so 1 or 2 items can affect that, and we're still cautious about Continental Europe and what's going to happen with Brexit, and we don't know. So there has to be some level of caution, but you have to look at our results and say, well, wait a minute, obviously our clients are spending, and we continue to see that. So that's the reason we still have some caution out there. And like I said, we're not spiking any football, but we're just managing our existing clients. That's why it's so important to manage our existing client base, and that's our strategy as we go forward."

Certain markets around the world are starting to get fairly expensive, and we've had growth in those markets. So we've got some pressure there, in markets like New York and London and Shanghai. But we continue to try and leverage the investments we've made to drive more efficiency, and shared services is a good example. We move more and more processing into our shared services center in Omaha. We're looking at various end market consolidations in countries. So there is more to do. We're never -- to Mike's comment about spiking football, we're going to continue to press, but I'm not sure if there's that much more runway, but we're going to continue to try. So I think salaries and leveraging salaries is critical to us. That's why we're pleased to see the progress in the BBT leverage."

We have many others as well, and we have hundreds of different data resources that we use in our analytics.

And the comment actually related to our digital business in addition to our PR business, which is obviously doing well, and that has a tendency to be more project-based, as is experiential and sports. What's happening on the digital side of the business, our goal is obviously to have the agency record in. What's encouraging is we do have longer-standing relationships with our special and digital agencies that is somewhat different than it used to be in the business, which is very encouraging. But still, a significant portion of our digital practice is more or less on a project basis. And now I think the definition of project-based is changing a little bit on the digital side. We have relationship with clients, and their spends vary based on projects within it. We still have the clients, and so for example, we're seeing a return of some clients that we have relationships with that may have not spent as much money last year, but we're starting to see the spend come back this year. So I characterize that as a sort of project business, and I think we have to deal with that more in the environment today because digital is such a significant part of both our growth and the offerings we have with our clients. So as long as we deliver the best-in-class offerings and we have the talent and the people, look, we've been living with a PR business that is more than 50% on a -- somewhat on a project basis, and we continue to perform. So it doesn't scare us. I think it's an opportunity, but it is a characterization of that business that you have to be sensitive to."

Look, obviously, our client base are large multinational clients that have significant advertising dollars and marketing dollars. And our goal is to always be -- to give them the best offerings we have and not just one discipline. The health of a client relationship is that we're bringing multiple services to the table, and that's truly what the integrated offering is all about. And what's encouraging is that when you look at our top 20 clients, we have multiple disciplines servicing those clients, and that's what gives rise to that type of organic growth. So you could take a bigger share of wallet from a particular client even though their spend not -- may not be going up if you're bringing in PR, if you're bringing in experiential, if you're bringing in media. So that represents the strength of opportunities with our existing clients. So -- and that's why I'm so pleased with those type of results. And it is so important therefore to keep the back door closed in terms of servicing clients, and that's what this business is about. We have to add value to our clients, and it's not just a one-off in terms of that. We have relationships with our clients that have lasted 50 years, and of course, those relationships go up and down like everything else. And we have to make sure that we're bringing the best ideas and talent to the table. And that's why our management teams have been doing so well, and that's why we're seeing the results that we're seeing. And that bodes well for, frankly, not just us but our industry. Everyone thinks that we're being disintermediated with all these ad tax and other services that are out there. But if we're properly servicing our clients and bringing in all of the talents and insights that we can bring, we're not going to get disintermediated. In fact, we see this as an opportunity. So I think so far, our results are reflective of that. On the pitch side, that pretty is consistent to what we said before. The Army, which is McCann, they have a statutory review that we have actually extended. The last time we defended the Army was in, I believe, 2011, and it's been extended through 2017. So great work both on the media side as well as the PR side and the advertising side. And obviously, we continue to do great work for that client. And since this is a normal review, we're not taking it lightly, but we believe we have a good chance of continuing. On the media side, BMW is the -- I think, the one pitch that's still remaining, that commenced last year, and it's running into 2016 on the media side. And UM has serviced the account. We've won actually some one-offs in the meantime in some foreign locations, so we're encouraged to see that. So again, that one is still out there. Fiat from MullenLowe is a review that was driven by procurement. So there, too, it's a mandatory procurement review. It's not that we're having trouble or the client is putting us at risk or -- it's a review. But every time there's a review, there's a risk. So those are the only big 3 that I believe are out there of note. There are a number of media reviews out there that are -- what we view as upside. We are -- that means we're not defending, but we're participating in that -- and it's public, so I can mention it. That's that 21st Century Fox and Volkswagen. Those -- we have -- we're participating in those reviews, and we hope to see some positive outcome from that. But again, it's all upside. And I think those are the major ones that I'll call out right now."

Outsourcing, you have to define outsourcing. We have a number of our agencies that use foreign sites in a low-cost environment to do 24/7 production facilities. And frankly, they're doing a tremendous job. We have lower costs, excellent talent, very strong results, 24/7, and it would be wrong for us not to take advantage of locating those type of facilities in those type of countries. It's not outsourcing in that it's our people that are doing it. So it's not that we're using third parties to do it, but we're locating our people in those geographic regions.

I'll start out by covering the highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies, to be followed by a Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Organic revenue growth was 6.7%. Notably, that comes on top of 5.7% a year ago. Our growth was driven by increases in all major disciplines, geographic regions and across most client sectors. This strong growth is consistent with our performance in recent years and a sign of the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. It's encouraging to see us start the year at the top of the competitive table in terms of growth. 
Acquisitions added another 30 basis points to growth in the quarter, while currency translation was a 3.1% drag on revenue. Reported revenue growth was therefore 3.9%. 
Q1 operating profit was $21 million compared with $8 million last year. As you all know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenue, while total costs are distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. That said, positive and sustained Q1 profit increases are yet another marker of continued strength and progress. 
During the quarter, we continued to combine our growth with effective expense discipline. We achieved leverage on our expenses for base payroll, benefits and tax and our office and general expenses. The result was Q1 operating margin expansion of 70 basis points. 
Our growth this quarter continues to reflect contributions from nearly all of our major agencies, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. 
Our digital offerings continued their strong growth. This includes the range of embedded digital capabilities within our Integrated Agency Networks as well as our stand-alone digital specialists. Once again, this result underscores that our partnerships with clients are evolving as they look to transform their businesses in response to an increasingly complex marketing landscape. 
Another contributor to our performance is our open architecture model, which we use to deliver solutions that are customized to client needs using the best of IPG solutions, notwithstanding silos. 
This reflects the growing importance of integrated communications services, something we have been focusing on for some time now. The quarter reflects strong growth with the existing clients as well as new business wins. 
In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail sectors. 
Regionally, performance was notably strong in the U.S., where we had organic growth of 8.3% on top of 6.1% in Q1 of '15 and where we continued to see outstanding contributions across a very broad range of our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. 
International organic growth was also strong at 4.3%, with all regions contributing. LatAm was especially notable at 11.6% organic growth. 
Turning to expenses and margin. Total operating expenses increased 3.2% compared with our reported revenue growth of 3.9%. As a result, Q1 operating margin improved by 70 basis points. 
Cost discipline and margin enhancement remain a top priority, and we continue to execute against that objective during the year. Our capital structure continued to be a source of value creation. 
As we announced in February, for the fourth consecutive year, our board increased our quarterly dividend by at least 25%. On our full year 2015 call, we also announced that our board had authorized another $300 million towards share repurchases. During the quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $54 million. 
More recently, we were placed on review for upgrade by Moody's, and our outlook was upgraded to positive by S&P. 
Of course, we're pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. As mentioned earlier, our ability to put together integrated solutions that are customized for the needs of our clients has increasingly become a differentiator for us, as is our focus on delivering outstanding insights and creativity and our commitment to maintaining and developing the top-tier digital capabilities we have across our portfolios. We also remain focused on driving further margin expansion and capital returns. 
The strength of our offerings, coupled with operating discipline, is a winning combination that we will ensure that we continue to deliver for clients and shareholders alike. 
While Q1 is seasonably small for us and there is still macro uncertainty, particularly in certain international markets, performance to date has us well positioned to deliver on the high end of the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. As the year unfolds, we will, of course, keep you apprised of our outlook, as was the case in 2015. 
At this stage, I'd like to turn things over to Frank for some additional detail on our results. And after his remarks, I'll be back to provide an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A."

As a reminder, I will be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview by results. Organic revenue growth was 6.7% in the first quarter, 8.3% in the U.S. and 4.3% in our international markets. 
Q1 operating profit was $20 million in our seasonally small first quarter, an increase of $13 million compared to last year. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is breakeven, adjusted for items below our operating income and other income in our tax line. Reported diluted EPS was $0.01 per share. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses as well as below-the-line items in detail on the slides that follow. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 4. Revenue was $1.74 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3.9%. Compared to Q1 '15, the impact of a change in exchange rates was negative 3.1%, while net acquisitions added 30 basis points. The resulting organic revenue increase was 6.7%. 
As you can see, on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 7.6% at our Integrated Agency Networks segment, very strong performance. 
We had contributions from all disciplines, led by McCann, R/GA, Huge, FCB and Mediabrands. CMG grew 3.2% organically, led by Weber Shandwick, Octagon and Golin. CMG growth was approximately 4%, excluding a decrease in pass-through revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. U.S. organic revenue growth of 8.3% was broad-based across our agencies, led by R/GA, FCB, McCann and Huge. Leading client sectors were tech and telecom, health care, food and beverage and retail. 
Turning to international markets. The U.K. grew 3.5% organically on top of 6.4% a year ago. We had notably strong growth at McCann, Mediabrands and R/GA. 
Continental Europe increased 1.7% organically. By country, we were led by strong results in Germany and modest growth in France and Spain. 
In Asia Pac, Q1 organic growth was 2.7%. We were led by very strong growth in China as well as by increases in Australia and India, while Japan decreased. In the region, we saw notable contributions by Mediabrands and R/GA. 
LatAm grew 11.6% organically, with strong performance driven by our agencies in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Brazil, however, remained soft due to macro headwinds. 
Our Other Markets group increased 7.4% organically, which includes strong growth in Canada. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of organic revenue change in a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 6.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. Underneath our reported revenue growth of 3.9%, total operating expenses increased 3.2% in the first quarter. Our ratio of salaries and related expense to revenue in Q1 was 73% this year compared with 72.5% a year ago. This comparison includes very strong Q1 operating leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax. It also reflects increased long-term incentive expense due to our consistently strong financial performance as well as greater expense for severance this year and increased expense for acquisition earnouts due to the strong performance of acquired businesses. 
Lower pass-through revenue also shifted some operating leverage from SRS to O&G where lower pass-throughs are offset by lower O&G expense. 
Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 49,700, which is an increase of 1% from Q4 '15, reflecting investment in higher-growth areas of the portfolio and to support our new business wins. 
Turning to ops and general expense on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.8% of Q1 revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points from a year ago, with leverage across most major expense components, notably our category of other O&G expense, which includes the benefits of lower pass-through expenses. 
On Slide 8, we share our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis, with the most recent data point of 11.5%. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity and our year-on-year comparison with detail on below-the-line items. 
Our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $16 million, mostly noncash related to the sale of small, nonstrategic agencies mainly in Continental Europe. As a consequence of the classification of certain of these assets as held for sale, we had a net tax benefit of $12 million due to reversal of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. 
Our tax provision also included an $8 million benefit from the adoption of new guidance on share-based compensation. The net effect on our reported results of the discrete items and the loss on sale of business was a benefit of $0.01 per diluted share in the quarter. 
Turning to the current portion of our balance sheet on Slide 10. We ended the first quarter with $680 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. It's worth noting that our cash level is seasonal, and it tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter. 
On Slide 11, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $649 million compared with $781 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business generates significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. 
During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital is $690 million compared with $785 million a year ago. Investing activities used $59 million in the quarter, including $27 million of CapEx and $27 million for acquisitions. 
Financing activities used $158 million, mainly for common stock dividend of $60 million and $54 million for share repurchases. 
Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter is $829 million compared with $926 million a year ago. 
On Slide 12, we showed debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, we are pleased with our revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the year. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."
108616,330038525,962001,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Frank.

The effectiveness of our offerings was evident in our continued strong organic revenue growth. Across the group, whether in advertising, marketing services or media, our strategic creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. 
It's particularly important that most of our agencies are contributing to our strong results and that we're seeing growth in all geographic regions. We continue to demonstrate disciplined cost management and will remain focused on conversion so as to deliver or exceed on our margin improvement targets for the year. 
As you've often heard me say, we're proud that IPG has become known as the destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent. Our senior corporate team has been together for some time. All of our talented people have brought the company through significant challenges to its current, very strong and competitive position. And we've done so with a high degree of integrity and humanity. 
Along with our focus on getting the best people with the right skills required to succeed in the digital world, we also have shown a long-term commitment to improvement as it relates to diversity and inclusion. We were the first company in our sector to name a chief diversity officer to establish diversity leaders across our major agencies within the group and interagency D&I business resource groups and to directly tie annual incentive compensation for our major agency CEOs and senior executives to progress on diversity and inclusion. 
Driven by these programs, we've seen significant improvements over time for all minorities, with close to 55% of our management positions currently held by women and approximately 20% by people of color, which we believe are industry-leading results. Nonetheless, we know there is still a great deal of work to do in this area. And uniquely, we stand by our record of taking swift and decisive action in enforcing accountability around D&I, particularly in those cases of behavior by senior executives that run counter to the kinds of values for which we should all stand. 
For some time now, our investment in talent has been a key driver of IPG's success. When we supplement that with strategic acquisitions, this should ensure that we maintain the very high level of expertise and service delivery that we're seeing from so many of our agencies. We also remain committed to robust capital return programs, and we can continue to drive value creation for our shareholders. 
Moving on to the tone of our business. We continue to hear from major clients a willingness to invest behind their brands. Our operators also tell us that the environment for marketers remain sound overall despite uncertainty in certain important markets, such as Brazil and Russia. So there should clearly be sufficient opportunity for us to achieve toward the high end of our stated full year growth objectives. 
But it's still early, with only the smallest quarter in the books. So we believe it's appropriate to stay focused on our goals and measured in terms of expectations. The new business pipeline is sound. There continues to be a significant number of media pitches and consolidations though not quite at the same historically high level as last year. 
Elsewhere in the group, our major integrated agencies are seeing solid activity, as our marketing service agencies. We're active in all of the major opportunities that are out there other than those on which we are conflicted. New business has been an area of strength for us in the past few years and an area in which collaboration has played a key role. We want to build on that performance. 
Highlights at the agency level include a strong quarter at McCann, which is winning business and recognition across a range of its companies and around the world. The focus on the part of the management team on creativity, cross-utilization of services to major clients and enhancing the specialists' digital, experiential and health care marketing offerings is contributing to strong growth at the Worldgroup. 
CMG agencies continued its strong performance, led by public relations. 
Weber Shandwick and Golin consistently take market share, and we added to their capabilities with acquisitions during Q1. ReviveHealth will build on Weber's outstanding health care practice, and Brooklyn Brothers will take Golin's digital content production to a new level of creativity. 
Late last week, we announced the acquisition of Speck to add a leading product design and innovation consultancy to the front end of FutureBrand's offerings. 
At Mediabrands, we have been active on onboarding much of the new business won during last year's very competitive consolidation and pitch activity. 
The new year began with positive news for UM in the Sony review. As you've heard before, the organic investments we've made in digital, programmatic and data are playing a key role on Mediabrands' success and growth. 
During the quarter, we added to their capabilities with a mobile acquisition in the U.K., and we'll continue to focus on mobile, social performance, marketing and analytics going forward. 
At FCB, progress continued to be evident in the agency's results. In Chicago, the agency further built on its Fiat Chrysler assignments, while FCB Inferno won additional BMW business in Europe and, earlier this week, prevailed in a highly competitive U.K. pitch for npower. 
FCB Health is a consistently strong contributor. And a new management team has been put in place in New York, while a dynamic new leader joined as North American president of the HackerAgency, an outstanding CRM agency that's part of the FCB Group. 
MullenLowe Group is increasingly active in new businesses, with wins from Hyatt Hotels, Etihad Airways and a number of other opportunities that are not public but in which they are among the finalists in significant reviews. The agency announced a new leader for its Boston office, who joins us after a long and successful stint as CMO at Converse. 
MullenLowe was also named the world's best creative agency at the Warc 100 awards and topped the Good Report for 2015's best campaigns for social responsibility. 
R/GA, Huge and MRM posted very strong starts to the year. In terms of the highly innovative work they are doing for clients, their financial performance and the recognition they are garnering in the marketplace is significant. R/GA has been pioneering what it means to be a digital marketer since the beginning of the connected age. The company continues to be honored as one of the industry's top agencies. 
Growth at Huge has been significant, and the agency recently named its first chief creative officer. 
MRM remains one of the industry's top global networks, powering the digital business for many of the world's largest brands. 
As you know, we've been clear for many years that the changing dynamics of media usage and behavior call for an integrated strategy when it comes to digital, not to the highly siloed approach taken by some of our peers. The benefits of investing in talent and embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio, as we've been doing for some time, continues to be evident in IPG's strong organic revenue performance. 
Of course, being able to combine these embedded digital offerings with our specialty agencies is even more powerful and just another example of how we mix and match the right capabilities and talent on all of our client engagements. 
We're pleased with the strong performance in Q1 with a very high caliber of our people and with the effectiveness of our capabilities. We continue to see some geographic markets where macro concerns will require monitoring. It's also worth repeating that Q1 is always our lightest quarter. We will, of course, remain vigilant on costs and the appropriate level of margin conversion. 
Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on the high end of a full year target of organic growth of 3% to 4% and to expand operating margin by 50 basis points or better. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
And as always, I thank you for your time and support, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year. 
With that, I will now open it up for Q&A."

Now that's a significant number, and it's something that reflects what we've been saying now for many years. If we continue to focus on treating our existing clients as if it was a pitch, there's opportunity to meet their needs in the marketplace given the talent and resources that we have. And that will be continued focus on all of our organizations, to treat our existing clients with that type of opportunity and commitment to meeting their needs. And if you add on top of that net business wins from pitches, obviously, that gets right for our results. Now coming into the year, obviously, we had some tailwinds as a result of the net new business. We see that rolling out more on the first half of the year. So let's assume there's about 150 basis points of tailwinds coming into the first half of the year, and in the back half of the year, that will slow down. So a combination of focusing on our existing clients and keeping the back door closed, winning when we are involved in pitches and focusing on our open architecture model is what makes us comfortable with our forecast going into the year."

And obviously, with these kind of results, we're not relying on one particular agency. And as you know, well, you were there with us from the beginning, this has been a journey in terms of repositioning our people and our organizations. And I've said this publicly and privately, I've never been more comfortable with the leadership of our organizations throughout all of our agencies than I am right now. Our most recent repositioning involved putting Mullen and Lowe together to form the MullenLowe Group, and I'm very pleased with how that's come out of the box in terms of new business wins and servicing their existing clients. So when you combine 3 global networks of MullenLowe, McCann and FCB on top of all the independent agencies we have in the U.S. some of them are not performing where we would like them to be. And of course, MullenLowe has a ways to go before they're achieving the levels of a McCann or an FCB. And frankly, that's the opportunity we have at IPG. Our media offerings continue to be best in class. They're recognized, obviously, UM in terms of its agency of the year awards and its positive results of new business, Weber Shandwick and Golin being top of the charts in terms of winning and gaining market share and certainly Weber winning all the recognition awards, our sports marketing and our experiential. So I'm very pleased with all of our offerings. That doesn't mean to say we can't refine that in terms of adding additional talent and go-to-market strategies and acquisitions. And given our financial position, we're in a position to do that. So I'm feeling -- what we told the team this morning, we're not spiking any football. This is still a journey. We still have margin improvement that's available to us, and that's what we're focusing on. But in the meantime, I have no doubt that if there's a -- there's an opportunity for us to pitch business, we will put together a world-class opportunity and team in place, and we will continue to focus on our existing client base, which is among the best in the world. So other than that, I'm pretty feeling -- feeling pretty comfortable about where we stand."

If you look at companies with your revenue mix, a lot of international, you tend to see tax rates sort of in the low 30s, and I know you guys are driving margins and trying to drive profitability, particularly in your European agencies. I guess if you could just think about the long term, do you see an opportunity for IPG to get its blended tax rate down? Because that would be a pretty meaningful EPS driver if that opportunity was there for you in sort of the investable future. 
And I'll just ask my second one. Your incentive comp as a percent of revenue, I think, was the highest it's been at least in a number of years. And I'm guessing that reflects your confidence in the year. I don't know, maybe you can spend just a minute on how you guys accrue during the year. Q1, as you said, is small, but it seems to be an indication of where you see the year coming in versus what your internal budgets might have been. So those are my 2 questions."

On the incentive comp, it's a little over 4% in the first quarter. And really, what that is, is our long-term incentive plan. Given the performance that we've had in the last couple of years and since our long-term performance is based on performance operations, it's encouraging to see that, that number is higher because it's reflective of our positive results. Over the year, we're still using a 3.5% number in terms of total incentive comp. So it does hit us a little stronger in the first quarter. And then of course, when you compare it to the light revenue in the first quarter, it magnifies the percentage of its impact. So this is all part of our plan. This wasn't a surprise. We know well that we're performing well in our incentive plans. Frankly, our incentive plans are working exactly as they should be. We have short-term plans that focus on both the agencies as well as overall performance and long-term incentives that look to what we need to drive continued consistent performance across the organization. So I think just look at that as a sort of one-off in the first quarter, which was actually a positive result given the performance that we've had. 
Tax is a whole complicated situation. As you know, we have $1 billion greater NOL, and that's principally in Europe. And in order for us to use that NOL, we have to generate income in those geographic areas. And we focus very -- we have a great international tax department that focuses on optimizing utilization of the NOL, which gets into, of course, agreements between countries in terms of allocations and so on. And we try to optimize it. But when we do have write-offs in foreign jurisdictions, unless there is income that we can use those write-offs against, we don't get the benefit that we were looking for. We do release some reserves which we saw the reversals in the first quarter. So we have a 28% to 30% cash tax rate, which we're using, which, frankly, is attractive versus our financial tax rate, which is 37% to 39% or 40%. So we still have a difference between cash versus book, and we're very focused on utilization of the cash NOL. In the U.S., we used up our cash NOLs, so what we rely on in the U.S. is good old-fashioned U.S. tax planning. We have a great tax department that focuses on that. So I do think that our NOL is an unaccounted-for asset on our balance sheet, but we can't benefit until we generate profitability. And since Continental Europe -- as you know, we did have positive results in Continental Europe this quarter, which is -- that's the second -- I don't know, at least second or third quarter in a row that we've been positive, not by a lot, but it beats the losses we've been having. So that's encouraging. But I do think there's opportunities, but we're not prepared to commit to a significantly lower cash tax as a result of it."

What I would say about our SRS is that the base benefit and tax, which is our -- roughly our fixed component of our salary, which we service clients with, that's our biggest areas of focus, and we're thrilled to see the amount of leverage we get out of it. And it's an area that we've been focused on for years and we'll continue to focus on. How do you take that fixed component of our employee base plus quite frankly, our temporary labor with service clients and get more leverage out of it? We're seeing it. With respect to the other components of SRS, Michael just commented on the incentive component. And to the earlier question, we didn't adjust our annual incentive accrual at all in the first quarter. So we booked it to budget. So all of that increase is related to the long term. 
And on the severance, we had some incremental severance in Europe, and we had some severance at a specific agency. And you're right, we should get some flow-through in the back half of the year."

This wasn't a partnership. This is a merger. And we have Alex heading up the global offering. So we see a tremendous opportunity in utilizing the MullenLowe go-to-market strategy on a global basis, with particular emphasis in the United States. And we're very encouraged in the way it's being received by the consultants in terms of pitch activity as well as its performance, both with the existing Mullen clients as well as the former Lowe clients. And the team has really meshed together. They understand it's a unified organization now and it's not siloed into Mullen or Lowe. And I'm very pleased with Alex and his entire team. He has added new people. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity. And Lowe -- Mullen and Lowe both have this reputation of creativity and being disruptors, if you will, in terms of their approach to client servicing. And it's a tremendous combination. Plus, give the digital media capabilities, and Lowe has Profero, which is an outstanding digital arm of Lowe that's performing exceptionally well.

And now your comments seem to be that clients are spending steadily, and financial markets have picked up, or at least equities have picked up. And I just wonder what your -- if we can give a bit more color on the state of client spending and client thinking in terms of investing in marketing. We've also seen some pretty good results or comments this reporting season from the likes of retailers and credit card issuers and so on, so it just seems like it feels even better now. 
And then just a quick housekeeping, I guess. Is there anything we need to know in terms of one-off below the line that -- I mean, it's small items, but they brought your EPS down by $0.01 in Q1. So anything ongoing, the size of the adjustment or anything else that we need to know about in the coming quarters?"

And in terms of if you're looking at the quality of our earnings in the first quarter, if you take off the one-off -- if you take out the one-off items, obviously, the quality of our earnings is very solid, and the EPS number is not really reflective of the type of performance we had in the first quarter. You always have risk in a quarter basis going forward, but I don't believe we have any significant items that we already know about that will hit in that way. The good news is we had the acquisition adjustment in terms of the performance. By the way, if we have it going through the rest of the year, that means our acquisitions have been performing better than we thought. So that won't be a bad thing. So I think hopefully, we won't have the noise, if you will, on below the line going forward for the rest of the year. 
My tone and my language is still -- it's cautionary because there's still a lot of stuff going out there. And -- but I did say at the end of the year when we talked about the caution that we didn't see any specific areas of caution, but there were a lot of noise. If you look at Latin America, that's a great example. Obviously, Brazil is an issue. And frankly, if you look at -- our organic growth in Latin America was over 11%. That's -- notwithstanding the fact that Brazil was break-even. And there, in Latin America, we had very strong results from our digital, whether it be R/GA, whether it be Huge, whether it be our media offerings in McCann in Latin America. So we had very positive results, notwithstanding the fact that Brazil, which is a large market for us, has significant risk in terms of what's going on there. Obviously, the government transitions there are an issue. So that causes us to be somewhat concerned in terms of what's happening there. In terms of -- the good news on the U.S. side is we're now 63% of our business being in the U.S. versus the end of the year, we were at 60%. That should be an indication of the strength of our offerings in the United States across the board. PR, media, advertising, digital, experiential and sports marketing, all of them in the United States are performing well, which is one of the reasons you see a 63% number. And we don't need -- if you look at the forecast for U.S. media and media overall, we're still in the 3% to 4% ad spend in the U.S. and globally, which is another reason why we're somewhat cautious in terms of what the organic number we're putting out there. Asia Pac continues, in China, India, Australia are all perform -- China, we had double-digit growth. So we have very solid offerings. India with single-digit growth, but last year, we had very strong comps that we had to go against. Australia continues to perform. Japan was slightly weak. So that causes us -- there's a lot of noise going on about China, but our results don't yet reflect this, so we have to be cautious about that. And then you go to Europe. And the U.K. results were slightly off of where we were before, and that is attributable to one -- some of our onetime items that were not as strong as they were, particularly in the U.K. Continental Europe, again, it's not significant to us. It's, what, 8%? And so 1 or 2 items can affect that, and we're still cautious about Continental Europe and what's going to happen with Brexit, and we don't know. So there has to be some level of caution, but you have to look at our results and say, well, wait a minute, obviously our clients are spending, and we continue to see that. So that's the reason we still have some caution out there. And like I said, we're not spiking any football, but we're just managing our existing clients. That's why it's so important to manage our existing client base, and that's our strategy as we go forward."

But still, a significant portion of our digital practice is more or less on a project basis. And now I think the definition of project-based is changing a little bit on the digital side. We have relationship with clients, and their spends vary based on projects within it. We still have the clients, and so for example, we're seeing a return of some clients that we have relationships with that may have not spent as much money last year, but we're starting to see the spend come back this year. So I characterize that as a sort of project business, and I think we have to deal with that more in the environment today because digital is such a significant part of both our growth and the offerings we have with our clients. So as long as we deliver the best-in-class offerings and we have the talent and the people, look, we've been living with a PR business that is more than 50% on a -- somewhat on a project basis, and we continue to perform.

I don't have the numbers, I'm not sure whether you do, but if that intuition is right, I mean, what do you think would be driving their increasing spending with you as a service provider relative to the sizes of their business? Because I think it might reflect somewhat on the place of the agency in the value chain over the longer term as well as obviously some great near-term strength. 
And then my follow-up was just, any major pitches that you would call out in the market right now, either opportunities or any potential defenses which you would just have us focus on?"

Look, obviously, our client base are large multinational clients that have significant advertising dollars and marketing dollars. And our goal is to always be -- to give them the best offerings we have and not just one discipline. The health of a client relationship is that we're bringing multiple services to the table, and that's truly what the integrated offering is all about. And what's encouraging is that when you look at our top 20 clients, we have multiple disciplines servicing those clients, and that's what gives rise to that type of organic growth. So you could take a bigger share of wallet from a particular client even though their spend not -- may not be going up if you're bringing in PR, if you're bringing in experiential, if you're bringing in media. So that represents the strength of opportunities with our existing clients. So -- and that's why I'm so pleased with those type of results. And it is so important therefore to keep the back door closed in terms of servicing clients, and that's what this business is about. We have to add value to our clients, and it's not just a one-off in terms of that. We have relationships with our clients that have lasted 50 years, and of course, those relationships go up and down like everything else. And we have to make sure that we're bringing the best ideas and talent to the table. And that's why our management teams have been doing so well, and that's why we're seeing the results that we're seeing. And that bodes well for, frankly, not just us but our industry. Everyone thinks that we're being disintermediated with all these ad techs and other services that are out there. But if we're properly servicing our clients and bringing in all of the talent and insights that we can bring, we're not going to get disintermediated. In fact, we see this as an opportunity. So I think so far, our results are reflective of that. 
On the pitch side, that pretty is consistent to what we said before. The Army, which is McCann, they have a statutory review that we have actually extended. The last time we defended the Army was in, I believe, 2011, and it's been extended through 2017. So great work both on the media side as well as the PR side and the advertising side. And obviously, we continue to do great work for that client. And since this is a normal review, we're not taking it lightly, but we believe we have a good chance of continuing. On the media side, BMW is the -- I think, the one pitch that's still remaining, that commenced last year, and it's running into 2016 on the media side. And UM has serviced the account. We've won actually some one-offs in the meantime in some foreign locations, so we're encouraged to see that. So again, that one is still out there. Fiat from MullenLowe is a review that was driven by procurement. So there, too, it's a mandatory procurement review. It's not that we're having trouble or the client is putting us at risk or -- it's a review. But every time there's a review, there's a risk. So those are the only big 3 that I believe are out there of note. There are a number of media reviews out there that are -- what we view as upside. We are -- that means we're not defending, but we're participating in that -- and it's public, so I can mention it. That's that 21st Century Fox and Volkswagen. Those -- we have -- we're participating in those reviews, and we hope to see some positive outcome from that. But again, it's all upside.

Outsourcing, you have to define outsourcing. We have a number of our agencies that use foreign sites in a low-cost environment to do 24/7 production facilities. And frankly, they're doing a tremendous job. We have lower cost, excellent talent, very strong results, 24/7, and it would be wrong for us not to take advantage of locating those type of facilities in those type of countries. It's not outsourcing in that it's our people that are doing it. So it's not that we're using third parties to do it, but we're locating our people in those geographic regions. Particularly in Latin America, we're seeing very good results with it. As far as outsourcing of non-production type people, we like New York."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business to be followed by the Q&A. 
We're pleased to report a quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.7% on top of a very strong 6.7% in Q2 '15. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, underlying Q2 organic revenue was 4%. Our acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points while FX was a negative 1.8%. As a result, our total revenue growth was 2.2%. 
We continue to see positive momentum from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be significant drivers of growth for us. We grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia Pac, and we saw growth from nearly every client sector. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $225 million and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.7%. Diluted EPS was $0.38 a share and was $0.33 adjusting for certain below-the-line items, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year's second quarter. 
For the first half of the year, organic revenue growth remained very strong at 5.1% and 5.4% excluding the impact of pass-throughs. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points and operating profit was up 10% for the 6 months, in which we also saw a similar 14% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q2. This performance continues the record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride. 
In terms of client sectors, leadership categories were tech and telecom, retail, food and beverage. U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2, a very solid result given that it came on top of 7.7% growth a year ago. We saw growth in most of our agencies led by R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. Internationally, LatAm grew 15.9% organically in Q2, an outstanding result. Organic growth was 1.2% in the U.K. where we did not see an impact for Brexit, while Continental Europe was approximately flat. In Asia Pac, our organic decrease was 3.2% but was actually flat excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues relating primarily to a major event in Hong Kong. This performance compares to Q2 2015 organic revenue growth of 11.8% in Asia Pac. In our other markets regions, organic growth was 7.3%, a result of strong increases in the Middle East and Canada. 
Turning to share repurchase. During Q2, we used $59 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we've utilized approximately $296 million for share purchases. We had $346 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. Since instituting our return to capital programs in 2011, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. To summarize, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in our digital expertise and in the world's key markets. 
At the midway point of the year, we believe we're well positioned with respect to our full year 2016 financial targets. You may recall that on our last conference call, we upgraded our growth target to the high end of our original 3% to 4% organic growth range along with 50 basis points of more of operating margin expansion. We continue to be comfortable with these targets for the full year. 
As expected, organic growth in the second quarter showed some moderation from our very strong first quarter increase. Within the quarter, we saw growth in June that was a lower rate than in April and May. It bears noting that this was in part due to the timing of revenue related to a couple of new business wins that we headed in 2015. Based on client work already underway, we are confident that we will realize this revenue during the second half of the year. As we've always stated, revenue was variable by quarter where total operating expenses are recognized more evenly across our 4 quarters. As a result, we expect to see higher rates of profit conversion on revenue growth in the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months. This would be consistent with our performance the last couple of years and it's why we feel that we're solidly on track with our objective to grow operating margin by 50 basis points or more this year. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks."

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter and was 5.1% for the 6 months. Q2 operating profit's $225 million with operating margin of 11.7%. For the 6 months, operating profit grew 9.9% and operating margin expanded 40 basis points. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.38 and was $0.33 as adjusted mainly for tax items which compared to $0.29 a year ago. That's an increase of 14%, and for the 6 months, adjusted diluted EPS also increased 14%. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 1.9% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q2 2015, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.8%. Our net acquisitions added 30 basis points of revenue. Resulting organic revenue increase was 3.7%. Organic growth was higher at 4% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues which occurred mainly in our events and direct marketing businesses. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Network, the organic increase was 3.9%. This was led by digital offers R/GA and Huge and by McCann and Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 5.6%. 
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.8% but was 5.1% excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We again have strong performance in public relations led by Weber Shandwick and in sports marketing at Octagon. For the 6 months, organic growth at CMG was 3% and 5% excluding pass-throughs. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 4.6% led by a range of agencies and disciplines including R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. In the U.K., organic growth was 1.2%, which reflects growth in McCann, R/GA and Weber Shandwick partially offset by client sharing in other parts of the portfolio. Our U.K. operators are not citing any specific impact on client spending during the quarter related to the runoff to the vote on Brexit. 
Turning to Continental Europe organic growth was 0.5% in the quarter. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets with organic increases in Italy and Spain offset by decreases in Germany and France. For the 6 months, organic growth was 1.1%. 
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q2 was 3.2% and was flat excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. This comes out 11.8% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had mid-single-digit growth in China and India while revenue decreased in Australia and Japan. For the 6 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 0.5%. In LatAm, Q2 organic growth was 15.9% with increases in nearly all of our largest national markets including Brazil, driven by increases in spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We have notably strong performance for McCan, R/GA and Huge. For the 6 months, organic growth was 13.9%. In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q2 at 7.3% driven by Canada and the Middle East. Growth was also 7.3% for the 6 months. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 5.6%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 2% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.2%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 1.8% which was the same impact we saw on our top line. Underneath our margin improvement in Q2, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.1% this year compared with 64.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by leverage on our expenses for incentives and other SRS partially offset by increased base payroll and severance as a percentage of revenue. The total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,100, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.2% of Q2 revenue compared with 24.3% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. There were a couple of moving pieces worth noting in comparison. Compared to last year, we had a very strong leverage this year at our other O&G category. Recall that a year ago, we have higher reserve expense for certain contingencies which we took in other O&G. Offsetting that, last year, we also had a one-time lease buyout credit in our occupancy line. As a result, we delever on occupancy this year. A net-net result was operating margin expansion of 20 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 6 months. 
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.6%, which is an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our year-on-year over earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 we reported in the quarter to $0.33 per share for comparability to last year. 
Starting on the upper half of this slide, our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $3.7 million, mostly noncash related to the sale of small nonstrategic agencies. Our tax provision included a benefit of $2.7 million from our adoption earlier this year of the new accounting guidance on share-based compensation. We are presenting this adjustment as long as we're preparing 2016 to '15 when it falls away next year. The more significant adjustment in the quarter is from the conclusion and settlement of a tax examination of previous tax years. That was $23 million, as you can see, and benefited our reported EPS by $0.06. Total adjustment Q2 is $0.05 per share due to rounding. 
On the lower half, we shall similar items covering the first 6 months and also include one of that reversal tax valuation allowances as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses. For the 6 months, we are adjusting from $0.40 as reported to $0.33, again as adjusted for comparability to 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $675 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end. 
Slide 11 is our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $94 million compared with $260 million a year ago. The comparison reflects the use of $128 million working capital this year compared to $42 [ph] million generated working capital year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile by quarter. Both this year and last year are within our historical range for Q2. Investing activities used $48 million mainly from acquisition and capital expenditures. Finance activities used $67 million chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $5 million. 
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.82 billion at the most recent quarter-end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, we're exiting the first half having achieved 5.1% organic growth and 40 basis points of market expansion which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We're seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is in an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Well, our Q2 results contributed to the strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the recent Cannes Festival which, as many of you know, is the industry's most prestigious creative award show. Standards is so high that fewer than 3% of entries even make it to the short list of contenders, yet we won over 200 trophies. Our agencies were responsible for 2 of the 3 most awarded campaigns in Cannes and we won 1 of only 5 coveted titanium lines. By our account, IPG was the most awarded holding company in terms of honors won with dollar of global revenue. Our long-standing commitment to integrated services through our open architecture model continues to be a strong differentiator for us because it puts the need of our clients at the center of the solutions that we craft and deliver from across IPG assets. We're also proud that IPG and our agencies remain a destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent and has been a long-term leader in the industry in terms of diversity and inclusion. 
During both the quarter and the first 6 months, we further demonstrated disciplined cost management. We will stay focused on conversion so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. We also continue to show that the work we have done over a number of years will bolster the company's financial fundamentals including a substantially strengthened balance sheet and credit ratings are significant drivers of value creation. For some time now, our results have shown that investing in talent and focusing on a culture of accountability and performance are key drivers of success. We use strategic acquisitions to supplement the very high level of expertise and service delivery for which our agencies for our holding company have become known. Increasingly, we also invest in internal programs that promote innovation such as the very successful accelerate as we operate with R/GA with a trial and partnerships with startups that takes place through Mediabrands' emerging media lab. Of course, we also remain committed to substantial return of capital to our shareholders as a way to build value. 
Moving on to the tone of the business. We've just completed our regular financial reviews with all of our operating leadership and the environment remains sound overall. While results in the quarter reflects slower growth in June, it does not appear to be a market change in client sentiment. Instead, a couple of the large wins we posted in 2015 saw some revenue being deferred into the second half with full year scopes of work that remain in line with our expectations. Given that the work is already well underway, we have a high degree of confidence in this revenue. 
Certainly, there's a high degree of volatility due to Brexit and the geopolitical tensions we're seeing play out in places such as Europe and the Middle East. Brazil is also experiencing some turmoil due to both the political situation and public health concerns. Globally, we're keeping a close eye on our event and other project businesses which are often the first to see cancellations. While it seems that the situation in the U.K. will lead to slow decision-making and may affect certain client sectors, to date, our teams on the ground report limited impact from the referendum. 
As you saw, our performance in Continental Europe was essentially flat with some markets seeing modest growth. The situation in that part of the world continues to be challenging, which could weigh on consumer sentiment and business activity. As previously indicated, we've built our plan for 2016 with very limited growth expectations for Europe and in this sense, we further benefit from our limited exposure to the region. 
Turning to the new business pipeline. There's a fair bit of overall activity. Media continues to be the most active sector followed by marketing services. These are both areas in which we've had good success in recent years. Our major global advertising-based networks are also seeing opportunities and we're seeing quite a number of integrated RFPs coming into the holding company with which we feel [indiscernible] agency teams with our open architecture approach. Other than a few situations where a client has decided to limit participation to incumbents [ph] we are active in most of the major pictures that are out there. Our performance in new business has been strong the past few years which is very gratifying. You've all head me say that I also want our agencies and our people just to focus on providing great service to existing clients and growing with them organically which we continue to see. At the agency level, highlights in the quarter included very strong performance from R/GA and Huge, which continue to be among the industry's most innovative agencies, providing the full range of digital marketing services including consulting with clients on digital business transformation, the connected space as well as storytelling across a range of new mediums and platforms. 
McCann once again posted strong performance across all disciplines, notably in its Momentum unit which won a major global sponsorship [indiscernible] from SAP and its MRM, which remains one of the leading global digital networks in the industry. The Worldgroup is also growing its relationships with recently won clients, notably record [indiscernible]. McCann saw for the strong results in a range of awards and competitions including Cannes where McCann was named network of the year and McCann New York had a stellar performance. 
MullenLowe showed strength in the quarter, notably domestically as its Royal Caribbean campaign earned attention and acclaim and the agency won JetBlue's Barclaycard. MullenLowe also had a very active on a number of integrated open architecture teams both our domestic and international, and we hope to be able to announce some wins connected with those efforts in the near term. 
At Mediabrands, results remain strong. The digital and accountable offerings within Mediabrands continue to be best-in-class and to power much of that unit's success. The performance of UM and its leadership has also been outstanding in recent years. On that front, we're pleased to confirm today that we've retained the BMW media AOR in the U.S. and Canada, another important win for UM and Mediabrands. Cannes was also a highlight for the group with a high degree of recognition for our work and the launch of the G100, a new brand assessment metric that has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace. 
Of course, on the media front, during the quarter, we saw the publication of the K2 report commissioned by the ANA. This relates to an issue that we at IPG have consistently handled in a highly proactive and transparent manner. As such, our conversations with clients relating to the report and the practices and [indiscernible] have been constructive. We continue to encourage dialogue on these matters and we stand behind our record of transparency in our contracts as well as our dealing with clients and media vendors. IPG's performance in this regard has been consistently validated by a range of third-party experts employed by our clients. We're also proud of our long-standing commitment not to take inventory media positions. These practices allow us to bring a highly informed and wholly objective perspective to our engagements so that we can consistently represent the best interest of our clients. 
Another operating unit that posted strong performance in the quarter was CMG. We benefit from exceptionally deep and experienced leadership teams at all of our units within this group. Furthermore, as capturing consumer's attention becomes more difficult and valuable in a world fragmented media, disciplines such as public relations, sports marketing, experiential campaigns and brand design will continue to increase in prominence. Notable wins in the quarter at Weber Shandwick included being named as the lead global public relations agency for General Motors' Chevrolet brand as well as the recent notable win at GSK. 
FCB also showed further progress during the second quarter. The global Clorox win was an important step for the network. FCB's health care and shopper marketing capabilities remain among the industry best, and for the second consecutive year, the agency posted its strong-than-ever performance in terms of awards won in Cannes. 
The benefits of investing in talent, embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as well as raising our game strategically and creativity continues to be evident in the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. We're pleased with the high caliber of our people and capabilities. This is what's fueled our strong organic revenue performance during the first half of 2016. Looking forward, despite increased macro uncertainty and the revenue timing that impacted our second quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver on the high end of our full year target of organic revenue of 3% to 4%. In terms of costs, we will stay diligent as the year progresses, and we remain closely focused on achieving the appropriate levels of conversion. Profit performance during the first half of this year show meaningful improvement, and we are on track to expand full year operating margin by 50 basis points or better consistent with our stated goal. 
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return which has been, and will continue to be, a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your support, and we look forward to keeping you posted as the year unfolds. 
With that, I'll open it up to questions."

It somehow seems that our client wins don't get announced while some of our competitors do. The answer to your first part of your question is, we continue to be net new business positive, which is an indication of the strength of our offerings. I did indicate a number of our recent wins in my prepared remarks, notably the recent retention of the BMW work at Mediabrands, which is a very good retention for us, obviously, in the wins at McCann and Weber with respect to Ricky Van Kieser. We do expect to announce a nice win coming up in the next couple of weeks. We hope that'll happen, which will be a global engagement, we hope, using the integrated open architecture approach. We don't like to give out tailwinds because -- let me just comment here. It's so hard in this business. When we lose clients, it's very easy for us to know the impact of when that revenue was going to be coming off. So when we talk about tailwinds and headwinds, the headwinds are easy. We don't like them but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins come in 2016. A number of them came at the end of the year. And frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is the [indiscernible] as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors in the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year. And the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration our year performance. As I said before, our clients don't know what our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting, which is why we stick an option that given the macro environment we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal which includes revenue performance and our conversion. And the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years."

Frankly, some clients don't care, and that's -- obviously our competitors who have very strong performance in those markets reflect that. But I think overall, the more there is in terms of scrutiny of these type of positions, I think it will have an impact on the business and that's been our strategy. And I've said this before, if, in the end, clients really don't care and it doesn't turn out to be a competitive advantage to us, then we'll continue to look at whether we should be doing it.

Well, look, obviously, MRM is the very strong component of the Worldgroup and IPG, and we're always looking to add talent and strength in our offerings. We see this as a big opportunity at MRM and the Worldgroup in terms of cost disciplines as well as potentially using that in the open architecture environment. So yes, we're beefing up our expertise in that particular segment and we believe that those opportunities will come as we strengthen their offerings. R/GA and Huge are very interesting examples of competency. They started out as pure-play digital agencies. And obviously, with the growth of digital, they've expanded dramatically. R/GA is a great tech story of growing globally with success in the markets that they've opened in. R/GA you can put up a shingle and all of a sudden, you have strong businesses. Their reputation is second to none in terms of their faith, and R/GA has done a great job of expanding their offerings focusing on the connected environment, and they're doing design, they're doing business transformation. So they've expanded their offering well beyond the typical digital play, if you will, and that's why we're seeing the great growth out of R/GA. Similarly, Huge has expanded. Remember, when we acquired Huge, we had 80 people in Brooklyn, New York. Now we have some 1,100, 1,200 people on a worldwide basis and they've expanded their offerings as well in terms of different offerings and their go-to-market strategy in terms of business transformation and, frankly, expanding upon just a pure-play digital offering. And if you plug those 2 agencies in our open architecture model, frankly, there's hardly many companies that compete with the strength of our global networks plugging in our digital plays to supplement their own expertise, and that's practically the whole concept of open architecture. And it's a challenge for us obviously because those individuals are focused on growing their wonderful businesses, but again, they also see opportunity partnering with some of our agencies. In fact, some of the wins that we've seen, we've seen partnering of those digital, whether it be Huge or R/GA, whether it be McCann, FCB or MullenLowe, although MullenLowe has [indiscernible] which is another digital agency that is performing extremely well on a global basis. So it's not by accident and we see our digital agency growing double digit. And of course, the embedded digital expertise we have at Weber Shandwick and the experiential marketing in all of our networks themselves have very strong digital offerings. So that's why we don't break out digital, frankly, because digital is really throughout our offerings So the concept of our open architecture is to provide the best talent we have within the expertise and bring the best to our clients, and frankly, it's working quite well. And hopefully, you'll see another win that reflects that in the next couple of weeks."

On the pass-throughs, yes, the answer's basically all of our pass-throughs have to do with our event. It has nothing to do with media ownership, which, obviously, is one of the confusing parts of pass-throughs from our competitors and us. And throughout the years, what we've been trying to do is change the contracts on these event engagements because when we act as an agent or not affects the accounting. What will happen is we will go out and outsource a lot of the people that are used in that engagement, and it's treated as a straight pass-through but the accounting has it in our revenue and in our expenses, so we back out the pass-through. So it's not something that's a surprise to us. In fact, those pass-through numbers are actually coming down because when we enter into contracts, we know that it's confusing from an accounting point of view so we try to structure the contracts to reflect it properly so that we don't find this.

We're at the camp that brings this the other way. Yes, interesting question on the U.S. Look, 62% of our business in the quarter came from the United States and there's no question that's the strength of IPG. We have very competitive offerings across all of our networks, plus let's not forget our independent agencies in the U.S. We have Deutsch, we have Hill Holliday. These are very strong marketing agency. We have very strong independent agencies in the U.S. And frankly, if there are U.K. or European companies looking to break into the U.S. market, we have more than enough competitive offerings to pick up that business, and obviously, the digital component in the U.S. is exceptionally strong. So we can really feel the great team to get that business. The other side of it is the U.S. side of the business is very competitive, particularly on the CPG side. While we did see some of our clients shift some business to us in the U.S. and as they do acquisitions in the U.S., they want to beef up the offering. So there is some of that growth in the U.S. and I view that as an opportunity. I think the fact that we have 62% of our business in the U.S. is a strong positive for us. I know as this goes through waves, if you will, in terms of we're better off in other countries, but we've been consistently very strong in the U.S., and frankly, we like that position."

And when you do that, our agencies perform better. That's the way we look at it. Of course, we do look at it that way. McCann was very strong this year in Cannes, and that's not by accident. McCann had a very strong emphasis on creativity. Rob Reilly and his team working with Harrison and the rest of -- part of the McCann Worldgroup had a very strong effort in Cannes and the results are reflective of that. McCann New York in particular, it was great to see the awards. They were winning, and of course, McCann Health of course won the health care agency here. So it is an important factor. Every year, we look at the question of risk reward in terms of spending the kind of money we do in Cannes. No one asks for the person who performs the poorest in McCann when we do [indiscernible]. So I believe we're going to continue to see a strong effort in terms of awards to reflect the creative power of it.

A lot of it was coming from the media owners, the TV owners, and a lot has to do with the upfront. Remember, last year's scatter, a lot of companies were caught flat in the scatter and they have to pay higher pricing. We saw an uptick in TV in the Upfront. And a lot of people read into that, therefore, the money going into digital is slowing and it's going back to TV. In the U.S. in terms of the spend, we see '16 sort of equal between digital and TV and, frankly at '17, we believe digital passed TV. So the growth of digital is slowing a bit because it keeps getting bigger and bigger but TV isn't going away. So our expertise is to help our clients decide where to put it. And some clients are happy with digital and they spend more in digital. Other clients are concerned about the ad fraud and visibility and are they getting the right ROIs in terms of [indiscernible] and all of the head blockers and so on and they're more comfortable with TV.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by the Q&A.
We're pleased to report a quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.7% on top of a very strong 6.7% in Q2 '15. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, underlying Q2 organic revenue was 4%. Our acquisitions have a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 1.8%. As a result, our total revenue growth was 2.2%.
We continue to see positive momentum from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be significant drivers of growth for us. We grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia Pac, and we saw a growth from nearly every client sector. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $225 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.7%. Diluted EPS was $0.38 a share and was $0.33 adjusting for certain below-the-line items, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year's second quarter.
For the first half of the year, organic revenue growth remained very strong at 5.1% and 5.4% excluding the impact of pass-throughs. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points, and operating profit was up 10% for the 6 months, in which we also saw a similar 14% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q2. This performance continues a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.
In terms of client sectors, leadership categories were tech and telecom, retail, food and beverage. U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2, a very solid result given that it came on top of 7.7% growth a year ago. We saw growth in most of our agencies, led by R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. Internationally, LatAm grew 15.9% organically in Q2, an outstanding result. Organic growth was 1.2% in the U.K. where we did not see an impact from Brexit, while Continental Europe was approximately flat. In Asia Pac, our organic decrease was 3.2%, but was actually flat excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues relating primarily to a major event in Hong Kong. This performance compares to Q2 2015 organic revenue growth of 11.8% in Asia Pac. 
In our other markets regions, organic growth was 7.3%, a result of strong increases in the Middle East and Canada.
Turning to share repurchase. During Q2, we used $59 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we've utilized approximately $296 million for share purchases. We had $346 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. Since instituting our return to capital programs in 2011, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. To summarize, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in our digital expertise and in the world key markets. 
At the midway point of the year, we believe we're well positioned with respect to our full year 2006 [ph] financial targets. You may recall that on our last conference call, we upgraded our growth target to the high end of our original 3% to 4% organic growth range along with 50 basis points of more of operating margin expansion. We continue to be comfortable with these targets for the full year.
As expected, organic growth in the second quarter showed some moderation from our very strong first quarter increase. Within the quarter, we saw a growth in June that was a lower rate than in April and May. It bears noting that this was in part due to the timing of revenue, related to a couple of new business wins that we headed in 2015. Based on client work already underway, we are confident that we will realize this revenue during the second half of the year. As we've always stated, revenue was variable by quarter, where total operating expenses are recognized more evenly across our 4 quarters. As a result, we expect to see higher rates of profit conversion on revenue growth in the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months. This would be consistent with our performance the last couple of years and it's why we feel that we're solidly on track with our objective to grow operating margin by 50 basis points or more this year.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks."

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter and was 5.1% for the 6 months. Q2 operating profit's $225 million with operating margin of 11.7%. For the 6 months, operating profit grew 9.9%, and operating margin expanded 40 basis points. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.38 and was $0.33 as adjusted, mainly for tax items, which is comparable [ph] to $0.29 a year ago. That's increase of 14%, and for the 6 months adjusted diluted EPS also increased 14%. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 1.9% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q2 2015, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.8%. Our net acquisitions added 30 basis points of revenue. Resulting organic revenue increase was 3.7%. Organic growth was higher at 4% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events and direct marketing businesses. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Network, the organic increase was 3.9%. This was led by digital offerings R/GA and Huge and by McCann and Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 5.6%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.8%, but was 5.1% excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We again have strong performance in public relations led by Weber Shandwick and in sports marketing at Octagon. For the 6 months, organic growth at CMG was 3% and 5% excluding pass-throughs.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 4.6%, led by a range of agencies and disciplines including R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. In the U.K., organic growth was 1.2%, which reflects growth in McCann, R/GA and Weber Shandwick partially offset by client sharing in other parts of the portfolio. Our U.K. operators are not citing any specific impact on client spending during the quarter related to the runup to the vote on Brexit.
Turning to Continental Europe organic growth was 0.5% in the quarter. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets, with organic increases in Italy and Spain offset by decreases in Germany and France. For the 6 months, organic growth was 1.1%.
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q2 was 3.2% and was flat excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. This comes on 11.8% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had mid-single-digit growth in China and India, while revenue decreased in Australia and Japan. For the 6 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 0.5%. In LatAm, Q2 organic growth was 15.9% with increases in nearly all of our largest national markets including Brazil, driven by increases in spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performance from McCan, R/GA and Huge. For the 6 months, organic growth was 13.9%. In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q2 at 7.3%, driven by Canada and the Middle East. Growth was also 7.3% for the 6 months.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 5.6%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 2% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.2%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 1.8%, which was the same impact we saw on our top line. Underneath our margin improvement in Q2, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.1% this year compared with 64.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by leverage on our expenses for incentives and other SRS, partially offset by increased base payroll and severance as a percentage of revenue. A total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,100, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.2% of Q2 revenue compared with 24.3% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. There were a couple of moving pieces worth noting in comparison. Compared to last year, we had a very strong leverage this year on our other O&G category. Recall that a year ago, we'd a higher reserve expense for certain contingencies which we took in other O&G. Offsetting that, last year, we also had a one-time lease buyout credit in our occupancy line. As a result, we delever on occupancy this year. A net result was an operating margin expansion of 20 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 6 months.
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.6%, which is an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago.
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our year-on-year over earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 we reported in the quarter to $0.33 per share for comparability to last year.
Starting on the upper half of this slide, our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $3.7 million, mostly noncash, related to the sale of small nonstrategic agencies. Our tax provision included a benefit of $2.7 million from our adoption earlier this year of a new accounting guidance on share-based compensation. We are presenting this adjustment as long as we are comparing 2016 to '15 when it falls away next year. The more significant adjustment in the quarter is from the conclusion and settlement of a tax examination of previous tax years. That was $23 million, as you can see, and benefited our reported EPS by $0.06. Total adjustment in Q2 is $0.05 per share due to rounding.
On the lower half, we show similar items covering the first 6 months and also include one of the reversal in tax valuation allowances as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses. For the 6 months, we are adjusting from $0.40 as reported to $0.33, again, as adjusted for comparability to 2015.
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $675 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
Slide 11 is our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $94 million compared with $260 million a year ago. The comparison reflects the use of $128 million working capital this year compared to $42 million generated working capital a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be validated by quarter. Both this year and last year are within our historical range for Q2. Investing activities used $48 million, mainly from acquisition and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $67 million, chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $5 million.
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.82 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 13, we're exiting the first half having achieved 5.1% organic growth and 40 basis points of market expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We're seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is in an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the re",1621,"Thank you, Frank. Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the recent Cannes Festival, which, as many of you know, is the industry's most prestigious creative award show. Standards are so high that fewer than 3% of entries even make it to the short list of contenders, yet we won over 200 trophies. Our agencies were responsible for 2 of the 3 most awarded campaigns in Cannes, and we won 1 of only 5 coveted Titanium Lions. By our account, IPG was the most awarded holding company in terms of honors won with dollar of global revenue. Our long-standing commitment to integrated services, through our open architecture, model continues to be a strong differentiator for us because it puts the needs of our clients at the center of the solutions that we craft and deliver from across IPG assets. We're also proud that IPG and our agencies remain a destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent and as we've been a long-term leader in the industry in terms of diversity and inclusion.
During both the quarter and the first 6 months, we further demonstrated disciplined cost management. We will stay focused on conversion so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. We also continue to show that the work we had done over a number of years will bolster the company's financial fundamentals, including a substantially strengthened balance sheet and credit ratings are significant drivers of value creation. For some time now, our results have shown that investing in talent and focusing on a culture of accountability and performance are key drivers of success. We use strategic acquisitions to supplement the very high level of expertise and service delivery for which our agencies and our holding company have become known. Increasingly, we also invest in internal programs that promote innovation, such as the very successful accelerate as we operate with R/GA, with a trial and partnerships with startups that take place through Mediabrands' emerging media lab. Of course, we also remain committed to substantial return of capital to our shareholders as a way to build value.
Moving on to the tone of the business. We've just completed our regular financial reviews with all of our operating leadership, and the environment remains sound overall. While results in the quarter reflects slower growth in June, there does not appear to be a market change in client sentiment. Instead, a couple of the large wins we posted in 2015 saw some revenue being deferred into the second half though with full year scopes of work that remain in line with our expectations. Given that the work is already well underway, we have a high degree of confidence in this revenue.
Certainly, there's a high degree of volatility due to Brexit and the geopolitical tensions we're seeing play out in places such as Europe and the Middle East. Brazil is also experiencing some turmoil, due to both the political situation and public health concerns. Globally, we're keeping a close eye on our event and other project businesses, which are often the first to see cancellations. While it seems that the situation in the U.K. will lead to slower decision-making and may affect certain client sectors, to date, our teams on the ground report limited impact from the referendum.
As you saw, our performance in Continental Europe was essentially flat with some markets seeing modest growth. The situation in that part of the world continues to be challenging, which could weigh on consumer sentiment and business activity. As previously indicated, we've built our plan for 2016 with very limited growth expectations for Europe. And in this sense, we further benefit from our limited exposure to the region.
Turning to the new business pipeline. There's a fair bit of overall activity. Media continues to be the most active sector followed by marketing services. These are both areas in which we've had good success in recent years. Our major global advertising-based networks are also seeing opportunities. And we're seeing quite a number of integrated RFPs coming into the holding company, with which we feel cross-agency teams with our open architecture approach. Other than a few situations where a client has decided to limit participation to incumbents, we are active in most of the major pictures that are out there. Our performance in new business has been strong in the past few years, which is very gratifying. You've all heard me say that I also want our agencies and our people just as focused on providing great service to existing clients and growing with them organically, which we continue to see.
At the agency level, highlights in the quarter included very strong performance from R/GA and Huge, which continue to be among the industry's most innovative agencies, providing the full range of digital marketing services, including consulting with clients on digital business transformation, the connected space as well as storytelling across a range of new mediums and platforms.
McCann once again posted strong performance across all disciplines, not only in its Momentum unit, which won a major global sponsorship [indiscernible] from SAP, and at MRM, which remains one of the leading global digital networks in the industry. The Worldgroup is also growing its relationships with recently won clients, notably Reckitt Benckiser. McCann saw further strong results in a range of awards and competitions, including Cannes, where McCann Health was named Network of the Year and McCann New York had a stellar performance.
MullenLowe showed strength in the quarter, notably domestically, as its Royal Caribbean campaign earned attention and acclaim and the agency won JetBlue's Barclaycard. MullenLowe also had a very active on a number of integrated open architecture teams, both domestic and international. And we hope to be able to announce some wins connected with those efforts in the near term.
At Mediabrands, results remain strong. The digital and accountable offerings within Mediabrands continue to be best-in-class and to power much of that unit's success. The performance of UM and its leadership has also been outstanding in recent years. On that front, we're pleased to confirm today that we've retained the BMW media AOR in the U.S. and Canada, another important win for UM and Mediabrands. Cannes was also a highlight for the group with a high degree of recognition for our work and the launch of the G100, a new brand assessment metric that has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace.
Of course, on the media front, during the quarter, we saw the publication of the K2 report commissioned by the ANA. This relates to an issue that we at IPG have consistently handled in a highly proactive and transparent manner. As such, our conversations with clients relating to the report and the practices it alleges have been constructive. We continue to encourage dialogue on these matters, and we stand behind our record of transparency in our contracts as well as our dealing with clients and media vendors. IPG's performance in this regard has been consistently validated by a range of third-party experts employed by our clients. We're also proud of a long-standing commitment not to take inventory media positions. These practices allow us to bring a highly informed and wholly objective perspective to our engagements, so that we can consistently represent the best interest of our clients.
Another operating unit that posted strong performance in the quarter was CMG. We benefit from exceptionally deep and experienced leadership teams at all of our units within this group. Furthermore, as capturing consumer's attention becomes more difficult and valuable in a world of fragmented media, disciplines such as public relations, sports marketing, experiential campaigns and brand design will continue to increase in prominence. Notable wins in the quarter at Weber Shandwick included being named as the lead global public relations agency for General Motors' Chevrolet brand as well as their recent notable win at GSK.
FCB also showed further progress during the second quarter. The global Clorox win was an important step for the network. FCB's health care and shopper marketing capabilities remain among the industry's best, and for the second consecutive year, the agency posted its stronger ever performance in terms of awards won at Cannes.
The benefits of investing in talent, embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as well as raising our game strategically and creativity continues to be evident in the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. We're pleased with a high caliber of our people and capabilities. This is what has fueled our strong organic revenue performance during the first half of 2016.
Looking forward, despite increased macro uncertainty and the revenue timing that impacted our second quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver on the high end of our full year target of organic revenue of 3% to 4%. In terms of costs, we will stay diligent as the year progresses, and we remain closely focused on achieving the appropriate levels of conversion. Profit performance during the first half of this year show meaningful improvement, and we are on track to expand full year operating margin by 50 basis points or better, consistent with our stated goal.
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your support, and we look forward to keeping you posted as the year unfolds.
With that, I'll open it up to questions."

It somehow seems that our client wins don't get announced while some of our competitors do. The answer to your first part of your question is, we continue to be net new business positive, which is an indication of the strength of our offerings. I did indicate a number of our recent wins in my prepared remarks, notably the recent retention of the BMW work at Mediabrands, which is a very good retention for us, obviously, and the wins at McCann and Weber with respect to Reckitt Benckiser. We do expect to announce a nice win coming up in the next couple of weeks. We hope that will happen, which will be a global engagement, we hope, using the integrated open architecture approach. We don't like to give out tailwinds because -- let me just comment here. It's so hard in this business. When we lose clients, it's very easy for us to know the impact of when that revenue was going to be coming off. So when we talk about tailwinds and headwinds, the headwinds are easy. We don't like them, but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that, and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins come into 2016, a number of them came at the end of the year. And frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is the [indiscernible] as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors, and the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year. And the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration a year performance. As I said before, our clients don't know what our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting, which is why we stick to an option that given the macroenvironment, we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal, which includes revenue performance and our conversion. And the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years."

Some -- frankly, some clients don't care, and that's -- obviously, our competitors, who have very strong performance in those markets, reflect that. But I think overall, the more there is in terms of scrutiny of these type of positions, I think it will have an impact on the business and that's been our strategy. And I've said this before, if, in the end, clients really don't care and it doesn't turn out to be a competitive advantage to us, then we'll continue to look at whether we should be doing it.

Well, look, obviously, MRM is a very strong component of the Worldgroup and IPG, and we're always looking to add talent and strength in our offerings. We see this as a big opportunity at MRM at the Worldgroup in terms of cost disciplines as well as potentially using that in the open architecture environment. So yes, we're beefing up our expertise in that particular segment, and we believe that those opportunities will come as we strengthen their offerings. R/GA and Huge are very interesting examples of competency. They started out as pure-play digital agencies, and obviously, with the growth of digital, they've expanded dramatically. R/GA is a great text of story of growing globally with success in the markets that they've opened in. R/GA, you can put up a shingle and, all of a sudden, you have strong businesses. Their reputation is second to none in terms of their faith. And R/GA has done a great job of expanding their offerings focusing on the connected environment. And they're doing design, they're doing business transformation. So they've expanded their offering well beyond the typical digital play, if you will, and that's why we're seeing the great growth out of R/GA. Similarly, Huge has expanded. Remember, when we acquired Huge, we had 80 people in Brooklyn, New York. Now we have some 1,100, 1,200 people on a worldwide basis. And they've expanded their offerings as well in terms of different offerings and their go-to-market strategy in terms of business transformation, and frankly, expanding upon just a pure-play digital offering. And if you plug those 2 agencies in our open architecture model, frankly, there's hardly many companies that compete with the strength of our global networks plugging in our digital plays to supplement their own expertise, and that's practically the whole concept of open architecture. And it's a challenge for us, obviously, because those individuals are focused on growing their wonderful businesses, but again, they also see opportunity partnering with some of our agencies. In fact, some of the wins that we've seen, we've seen partnering of those digital -- whether it be Huge or R/GA, whether it be McCann, FCB or MullenLowe, although MullenLowe has Profero, which is another digital agency, that is performing extremely well on a global basis. So it's not by accident and we see our digital agency growing double digit. And of course, the embedded digital expertise we have at Weber Shandwick and the experiential marketing in all of our networks themselves have very strong digital offerings. So that's why we don't break out digital, frankly, because digital is really throughout our offerings. So the concept of our open architecture is to provide the best talent we have within the expertise and bring the best to our clients, and frankly, it's working quite well. And hopefully, you'll see another win that reflects that in the next couple of weeks."

It sounded like this kind of came in June? Or is this kind of mapped more directly to what you're expecting for the quarter? And then quickly for Frank. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on working cap? Understand that this quarter was within range, but is there anything there worth calling out? And then just wanted to quickly check with you on the impending changes to the overtime rules? And whether that's fully contemplated at this point by all your agencies? And whether that's kind of a de minimis impact going forward? Or any color you could offer on that?"

It's not a significant number. And obviously, we're working towards reducing it. And we will, in fact, implement whatever we need to do to minimize the effect of it. On the pass-throughs, yes, the answer is basically all of our pass-throughs have to do with our event. It has nothing to do with media ownership, which, obviously, is one of the confusing parts of pass-throughs from our competitors and us. And throughout the years, what we've been trying to do is change the contracts on these event engagements, because whether we act as an agent or not affects the accounting. What would happen is we will go out and outsource a lot of the people that are used in that engagement, and it's treated as a straight pass-through, but the accounting has it in our revenue and in our expenses, so we back out the pass-through. So it's not something that's a surprise to us, in fact -- and those pass-through numbers are actually coming down, because when we enter into contracts, we know that it's confusing from an accounting point of view so we try to structure the contracts to reflect it properly so that we don't find this. So if you look at it on a global basis, we have 30 basis points of pass-throughs, which is why if you looked at our overall organic, we would increase that organic by 30 basis points."

And what's happening, some of our clients are just asking to look in as far as the ANA report. Of course, we have dialogues with our clients, and going over contracts, making sure our language is as tight as it has been. We had all these provisions in our contracts before, whether it be the ability to audit transparency. So clients, they'll ask questions like that, but I don't see any big upheaval in terms of reviews as a result of the ANA. I know there's one particular company out there, not a client of ours, that has broadened their outside auditors to look at this kind of stuff. I'm knocking on wood, we haven't seen any of that."

These are very strong marketing agency. We have very strong independent agencies in the U.S. And frankly, if there are U.K. or European companies looking to break into the U.S. market, we have more than enough competitive offerings to pick up that business. And obviously, the digital component in the U.S. is exceptionally strong. So we can really feel the great team to get that business. The other side of it is the U.S. side of the business is very competitive, particularly on the CPG side. While we did see some of our clients shift some business to us in the U.S. and as they do acquisitions in the U.S., they want to beef up the offering. So there is some of that growth in the U.S., and I view that as an opportunity. I think the fact that we have 62% of our business in the U.S. is a strong positive for us.

And when you do that, our agencies perform better. That's the way we look at it, of course, we're going to look at it that way. McCann was very strong this year in Cannes, and that's not by accident. McCann had a very strong emphasis on creativity. Rob Reilly and his team working with Harrison and the rest of -- part of the McCann Worldgroup had a very strong effort in Cannes and the results are reflective of that. McCann New York in particular, it was great to see the awards. They were winning, and of course, McCann Health was -- won the health care agency here. So it is an important factor. Every year, we look at the question of risk reward in terms of spending the kind of money we do in Cannes. No one asks for the person who performs the poorest in McCann when we do reviews. So I believe we're going to continue to see a strong effort in terms of awards and to reflect the creative power of it. Creativity and effectiveness is a critical component of what we do, which is why FCB and MullenLowe, all of our agencies participate in it, but we pick and choose which to work we want to put in.

A lot of it was coming from the media owners, the TV owners, and a lot has to do with the upfront.

And a lot of people read into that, therefore, the money going into digital is slowing and it's going back to TV. In the U.S., in terms of the spend, we see '16 sort of equal between digital and TV, and frankly, in '17, we believe digital will pass TV. So the growth of digital is slowing a bit because, look, it keeps getting bigger and bigger, but TV isn't going away. So our expertise is to help our clients decide where to put it. And some clients are happy with digital, and they spend more in digital. Other clients are concerned about the ad fraud and visibility, and are they getting the right ROIs in terms of bots and all of the head blockers and so on, and they're more comfortable with TV.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by the Q&A.
We're pleased to report a quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.7% on top of a very strong 6.7% in Q2 '15. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, underlying Q2 organic revenue was 4%. Our acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 1.8%. As a result, our total revenue growth was 2.2%.
We continue to see positive momentum from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be significant drivers of growth for us. We grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia Pac, and we saw a growth from nearly every client sector. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $225 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.7%. Diluted EPS was $0.38 a share and was $0.33 adjusting for certain below-the-line items, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year's second quarter.
For the first half of the year, organic revenue growth remained very strong at 5.1% and 5.4% excluding the impact of pass-throughs. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points, and operating profit was up 10% for the 6 months, in which we also saw a similar 14% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q2. This performance continues a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.
In terms of client sectors, leadership categories were tech and telecom, retail, food and beverage. U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2, a very solid result given that it came on top of 7.7% growth a year ago. We saw growth in most of our agencies, led by R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. Internationally, LatAm grew 15.9% organically in Q2, an outstanding result. Organic growth was 1.2% in the U.K. where we did not see an impact from Brexit, while Continental Europe was approximately flat. In Asia Pac, our organic decrease was 3.2%, but was actually flat excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues relating primarily to a major event in Hong Kong. This performance compares to Q2 2015 organic revenue growth of 11.8% in Asia Pac. 
In our other markets regions, organic growth was 7.3%, a result of strong increases in the Middle East and Canada.
Turning to share repurchase. During Q2, we used $59 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we've utilized approximately $296 million for share purchases. We had $346 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. Since instituting our return to capital programs in 2011, we've returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. To summarize, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in our digital expertise and in the world's key markets. 
At the midway point of the year, we believe we're well positioned with respect to our full year 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] financial targets. You may recall that on our last conference call, we upgraded our growth target to the high end of our original 3% to 4% organic growth range along with 50 basis points of more of operating margin expansion. We continue to be comfortable with these targets for the full year.
As expected, organic growth in the second quarter showed some moderation from our very strong first quarter increase. Within the quarter, we saw a growth in June that was a lower rate than in April and May. It bears noting that this was in part due to the timing of revenue, related to a couple of new business wins that we added in 2015. Based on client work already underway, we are confident that we will realize this revenue during the second half of the year. As we've always stated, revenue was variable by quarter, where total operating expenses are recognized more evenly across our 4 quarters. As a result, we expect to see higher rates of profit conversion on revenue growth in the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months. This would be consistent with our performance the last couple of years and it's why we feel that we are solidly on track with our objective to grow operating margin by 50 basis points or more this year.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks."

Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter",1404,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter and was 5.1% for the 6 months. Q2 operating profit was $225 million with operating margin of 11.7%. For the 6 months, operating profit grew 9.9%, and operating margin expanded 40 basis points. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.38 and was $0.33 as adjusted, mainly for tax items, which is comparable to $0.29 a year ago. That's increase of 14%, and for the 6 months adjusted diluted EPS also increased 14%. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 1.9% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q2 2015, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.8%. Our net acquisitions added 30 basis points of revenue. Resulting organic revenue increase was 3.7%. Organic growth was higher at 4% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events and direct marketing businesses. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Network, the organic increase was 3.9%. This was led by digital offerings R/GA and Huge and by McCann and Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 5.6%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.8%, but was 5.1% excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We again have strong performance in public relations led by Weber Shandwick and in sports marketing at Octagon. For the 6 months, organic growth at CMG was 3% and 5% excluding pass-throughs.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 4.6%, led by a range of agencies and disciplines including R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. In the U.K., organic growth was 1.2%, which reflects growth in McCann, R/GA and Weber Shandwick partially offset by client sharing in other parts of the portfolio. Our U.K. operators are not citing any specific impact on client spending during the quarter related to the runup to the vote on Brexit.
Turning to Continental Europe organic growth was 0.5% in the quarter. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets, with organic increases in Italy and Spain offset by decreases in Germany and France. For the 6 months, organic growth was 1.1%.
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q2 was 3.2% and was flat excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. This comes on 11.8% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had mid-single-digit growth in China and India, while revenue decreased in Australia and Japan. For the 6 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 0.5%. In LatAm, Q2 organic growth was 15.9% with increases in nearly all of our largest national markets including Brazil, driven by increases in spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Huge. For the 6 months, organic growth was 13.9%. In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q2 at 7.3%, driven by Canada and the Middle East. Growth was also 7.3% for the 6 months.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 5.6%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 2% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.2%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 1.8%, which was the same impact we saw on our top line. Underneath our margin improvement in Q2, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.1% this year compared with 64.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by leverage on our expenses for incentives and other SRS, partially offset by increased base payroll and severance as a percentage of revenue. A total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,100, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.2% of Q2 revenue compared with 24.3% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. There were a couple of moving pieces worth noting in comparison. Compared to last year, we had a very strong leverage this year on our other O&G category. Recall that a year ago, we'd a higher reserve expense for certain contingencies which we took in other O&G. Offsetting that, last year, we also had a one-time lease buyout credit in our occupancy line. As a result, we delever on occupancy this year. A net result was an operating margin expansion of 20 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 6 months.
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.6%, which is an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago.
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our year-on-year over earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 we reported in the quarter to $0.33 per share for comparability to last year.
Starting on the upper half of this slide, our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $3.7 million, mostly noncash, related to the sale of small nonstrategic agencies. Our tax provision included a benefit of $2.7 million from our adoption earlier this year of a new accounting guidance on share-based compensation. We are presenting this adjustment as long as we are comparing 2016 to '15, but it falls away next year. The more significant adjustment in the quarter is from the conclusion and settlement of a tax examination of previous tax years. That was $23 million, as you can see, and benefited our reported EPS by $0.06. Total adjustment in Q2 is $0.05 per share due to rounding.
On the lower half, we show similar items covering the first 6 months and also include one of the reversal in tax valuation allowances as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses. For the 6 months, we are adjusting from $0.40 as reported to $0.33, again, as adjusted for comparability to 2015.
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $675 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
Slide 11 is our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $94 million compared with $260 million a year ago. The comparison reflects the use of $128 million working capital this year compared to $42 million generated working capital a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile by quarter. Both this year and last year are within our historical range for Q2. Investing activities used $48 million, mainly from acquisition and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $67 million, chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $5 million.
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.82 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 13, we're exiting the first half having achieved 5.1% organic growth and 40 basis points of market expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We're seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is in an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."
108616,372212052,1009663,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016.

Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the recent Cannes Festival, which, as many of you know, is the industry's most prestigious creative award show. Standards are so high that fewer than 3% of entries even make it to the short list of contenders, yet we won over 200 trophies. Our agencies were responsible for 2 of the 3 most awarded campaigns in Cannes, and we won 1 of only 5 coveted Titanium Lions. By our account, IPG was the most awarded holding company in terms of honors won per dollar of global revenue. Our long-standing commitment to integrated services, through our open architecture, model continues to be a strong differentiator for us because it puts the needs of our clients at the center of the solutions that we craft and deliver from across IPG assets. We're also proud that IPG and our agencies remain a destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent and as we've been a long-term leader in the industry in terms of diversity and inclusion.
During both the quarter and the first 6 months, we further demonstrated disciplined cost management. We will stay focused on conversion so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. We also continue to show that the work we had done over a number of years will bolster the company's financial fundamentals, including a substantially strengthened balance sheet and credit ratings are significant drivers of value creation. For some time now, our results have shown that investing in talent and focusing on a culture of accountability and performance are key drivers of success. We use strategic acquisitions to supplement the very high level of expertise and service delivery for which our agencies and our holding company have become known. Increasingly, we also invest in internal programs that promote innovation, such as the very successful accelerators we operate with R/GA, with a trial and partnerships with startups that take place through Mediabrands' emerging media lab. Of course, we also remain committed to substantial return of capital to our shareholders as a way to build value.
Moving on to the tone of the business. We've just completed our regular financial reviews with all of our operating leadership, and the environment remains sound overall. While results in the quarter reflects slower growth in June, there does not appear to be a market change in client sentiment. Instead, a couple of the large wins we posted in 2015 saw some revenue being deferred into the second half though with full year scopes of work that remain in line with our expectations. Given that the work is already well underway, we have a high degree of confidence in this revenue.
Certainly, there's a high degree of volatility due to Brexit and the geopolitical tensions we're seeing play out in places such as Europe and the Middle East. Brazil is also experiencing some turmoil, due to both the political situation and public health concerns. Globally, we're keeping a close eye on our event and other project businesses, which are often the first to see cancellations. While it seems that the situation in the U.K. will lead to slower decision-making and may affect certain client sectors, to date, our teams on the ground report limited impact from the referendum.
As you saw, our performance in Continental Europe was essentially flat with some markets seeing modest growth. The situation in that part of the world continues to be challenging, which could weigh on consumer sentiment and business activity. As previously indicated, we've built our plan for 2016 with very limited growth expectations for Europe. And in this sense, we further benefit from our limited exposure to the region.
Turning to the new business pipeline. There's a fair bit of overall activity. Media continues to be the most active sector followed by marketing services. These are both areas in which we've had good success in recent years. Our major global advertising-based networks are also seeing opportunities. And we're seeing quite a number of integrated RFPs coming into the holding company, for which we field cross-agency teams with our open architecture approach. Other than a few situations where a client has decided to limit participation to incumbents, we are active in most of the major pitches that are out there. Our performance in new business has been strong in the past few years, which is very gratifying. You've all heard me say that I also want our agencies and our people just as focused on providing great service to existing clients and growing with them organically, which we continue to see.
At the agency level, highlights in the quarter included very strong performance from R/GA and Huge, which continue to be among the industry's most innovative agencies, providing the full range of digital marketing services, including consulting with clients on digital business transformation, the connected space as well as storytelling across a range of new mediums and platforms.
McCann once again posted strong performance across all disciplines, notably in its Momentum unit, which won a major global sponsorship brief from SAP, and at MRM, which remains one of the leading global digital networks in the industry. The Worldgroup is also growing its relationships with recently won clients, notably Reckitt Benckiser. McCann saw further strong results in a range of awards and competitions, including Cannes, where McCann Health was named Network of the Year and McCann New York had a stellar performance.
MullenLowe showed strength in the quarter, notably domestically, as its Royal Caribbean campaign earned attention and acclaim and the agency won JetBlue's Barclaycard. MullenLowe also had a very active on a number of integrated open architecture teams, both domestic and international. And we hope to be able to announce some wins connected with those efforts in the near term.
At Mediabrands, results remain strong. The digital and accountable offerings within Mediabrands continue to be best-in-class and to power much of that unit's success. The performance of UM and its leadership has also been outstanding in recent years. On that front, we're pleased to confirm today that we've retained the BMW media AOR in the U.S. and Canada, another important win for UM and Mediabrands. Cannes was also a highlight for the group with a high degree of recognition for our work and the launch of the G100, a new brand assessment metric that has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace.
Of course, on the media front, during the quarter, we saw the publication of the K2 report commissioned by the ANA. This relates to an issue that we at IPG have consistently handled in a highly proactive and transparent manner. As such, our conversations with clients relating to the report and the practices it alleges have been constructive. We continue to encourage dialogue on these matters, and we stand behind our record of transparency in our contracts as well as our dealing with clients and media vendors. IPG's performance in this regard has been consistently validated by a range of third-party experts employed by our clients. We're also proud of a long-standing commitment not to take inventory media positions. These practices allow us to bring a highly informed and wholly objective perspective to our engagements, so that we can consistently represent the best interest of our clients.
Another operating unit that posted strong performance in the quarter was CMG. We benefit from exceptionally deep and experienced leadership teams at all of our units within this group. Furthermore, as capturing consumer's attention becomes more difficult and valuable in a world of fragmented media, disciplines such as public relations, sports marketing, experiential campaigns and brand design will continue to increase in prominence. Notable wins in the quarter at Weber Shandwick included being named as the lead global public relations agency for General Motors' Chevrolet brand as well as their recent notable win at GSK.
FCB also showed further progress during the second quarter. The global Clorox win was an important step for the network. FCB's health care and shopper marketing capabilities remain among the industry's best, and for the second consecutive year, the agency posted its stronger ever performance in terms of awards won at Cannes.
The benefits of investing in talent, embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as well as raising our game strategically and creatively continues to be evident in the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. We're pleased with a high caliber of our people and capabilities. This is what has fueled our strong organic revenue performance during the first half of 2016.
Looking forward, despite increased macro uncertainty and the revenue timing that impacted our second quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver on the high end of our full year target of organic revenue of 3% to 4%. In terms of costs, we will stay diligent as the year progresses, and we remain closely focused on achieving the appropriate levels of conversion. Profit performance during the first half of this year showed meaningful improvement, and we are on track to expand full year operating margin by 50 basis points or better, consistent with our stated goal.
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your support, and we look forward to keeping you posted as the year unfolds.
With that, I'll open it up to questions."

It somehow seems that our client wins don't get announced while some of our competitors do. The answer to your first part of your question is, we continue to be net new business positive, which is an indication of the strength of our offerings. I did indicate a number of our recent wins in my prepared remarks, notably the recent retention of the BMW work at Mediabrands, which is a very good retention for us, obviously, and the wins at McCann and Weber with respect to Reckitt Benckiser. We do expect to announce a nice win coming up in the next couple of weeks. We hope that will happen, which will be a global engagement, we hope, using the integrated open architecture approach. We don't like to give out tailwinds because -- let me just comment here. It's so hard in this business. When we lose clients, it's very easy for us to know the impact of when that revenue is going to be coming off. So when we talk about tailwinds and headwinds, the headwinds are easy. We don't like them, but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that, and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins come into 2016, a number of them came at the end of the year. And frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is developed as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors, and the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year. And the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration a year performance. As I said before, our clients don't know what our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting, which is why we stick to our notion that given the macro environment, we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal, which includes revenue performance and our conversion. And the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years."

Some -- frankly, some clients don't care and, obviously, our competitors who have very strong performance in those markets reflect that. But I think overall, the more there is in terms of scrutiny of these type of positions, I think it will have an impact on the business and that's been our strategy. And I've said this before, if, in the end, clients really don't care and it doesn't turn out to be a competitive advantage to us, then we'll continue to look at whether we should be doing it.

Well, look, obviously, MRM is a very strong component of the Worldgroup and IPG, and we're always looking to add talent and strength in our offerings. We see it as a big opportunity at MRM at the Worldgroup in terms of cross disciplines as well as potentially using that in the open architecture environment. So yes, we're beefing up our expertise in that particular segment, and we believe that those opportunities will come as we strengthen their offerings. R/GA and Huge are very interesting examples of competency. They started out as pure-play digital agencies, and obviously, with the growth of digital, they've expanded dramatically. R/GA is a great textbook story of growing globally with success in the markets that they've opened in. R/GA, you can put up a shingle and, all of a sudden, you have strong businesses. Their reputation is second to none in terms of their space. And R/GA has done a great job of expanding their offerings focusing on the connected environment. And they're doing design, they're doing business transformation. So they've expanded their offering well beyond the typical digital play, if you will, and that's why we're seeing the great growth out of R/GA. Similarly, Huge has expanded. Remember, when we acquired Huge, we had 80 people in Brooklyn, New York. Now we have some 1,100, 1,200 people on a worldwide basis. And they've expanded their offerings as well in terms of different offerings and their go-to-market strategy in terms of business transformation, and frankly, expanding upon just a pure-play digital offering. And if you plug those 2 agencies in our open architecture model, frankly, there's hardly many companies that compete with the strength of our global networks plugging in our digital plays to supplement their own expertise, and that's practically the whole concept of open architecture. And it's a challenge for us, obviously, because those individuals are focused on growing their wonderful businesses, but again, they also see opportunity partnering with some of our agencies. In fact, some of the wins that we've seen, we've seen partnering of those digital -- whether it be Huge or R/GA with whether it be McCann, FCB or MullenLowe -- although MullenLowe has Profero, which is another digital agency, that is performing extremely well on a global basis. So it's not by accident and we see our digital agency growing double digit. And of course, the embedded digital expertise we have at Weber Shandwick and the experiential marketing in all of our networks themselves have very strong digital offerings. So that's why we don't break out digital, frankly, because digital is really throughout our offerings. So the concept of our open architecture is to provide the best talent we have within the expertise and bring the best to our clients, and frankly, it's working quite well. And hopefully, you'll see another win that reflects that in the next couple of weeks."

It has nothing to do with media ownership, which, obviously, is one of the confusing parts of pass-throughs from our competitors and us. And throughout the years, what we've been trying to do is change the contracts on these event engagements, because whether we act as an agent or not affects the accounting. What would happen is we will go out and outsource a lot of the people that are used in that engagement, and it's treated as a straight pass-through, but the accounting has it in our revenue and in our expenses, so we back out the pass-through. So it's not something that's a surprise to us, in fact -- and those pass-through numbers are actually coming down, because when we enter into contracts, we know that it's confusing from an accounting point of view so we try to structure the contracts to reflect it properly so that we don't find this.

And when you do that, our agencies perform better. That's the way we look at it, of course, we're going to look at it that way. McCann was very strong this year in Cannes, and that's not by accident. McCann had a very strong emphasis on creativity. Rob Reilly and his team working with Harris and the rest of -- part of the McCann Worldgroup had a very strong effort in Cannes and the results are reflective of that. McCann New York in particular, it was great to see the awards they were winning, and of course, McCann Health was -- won the health care agency of the year. So it is an important factor. Every year, we look at the question of risk reward in terms of spending the kind of money we do in Cannes. No one asks for the person who performed the poorest in Cannes when we do reviews. So I believe we're going to continue to see a strong effort in terms of awards and to reflect the creative power of it.

A lot of it was coming from the media owners, the TV owners, and a lot had to do with the upfront. Remember, last year's scatter, a lot of companies were caught flat in the scatter and had to pay higher pricing. So we saw an uptick on TV in the Upfront. And a lot of people read into that, therefore, the money going into digital is slowing and it's going back to TV. Our -- in the U.S., in terms of the spend, we see '16 sort of equal between digital and TV, and frankly, in '17, we believe digital will pass TV. So the growth of digital is slowing a bit because, look, it keeps getting bigger and bigger, but TV isn't going away. So our expertise is to help our clients decide where to put it. And some clients are happy with digital, and they spend more in digital. Other clients are concerned about the ad fraud and visibility, and are they getting the right ROIs in terms of bots and all of the ad blockers and so on, and they're more comfortable with TV. It's a question of what gives the clients the best ROI, and frankly, that's what we get paid to do, in terms of help our clients understand it. So -- and we continue to see that as the opportunity for our business.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by the Q&A.
We're pleased to report a quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.7% on top of a very strong 6.7% in Q2 '15. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues, underlying Q2 organic revenue was 4%. Our acquisitions had a positive impact of 30 basis points, while FX was a negative 1.8%. As a result, our total revenue growth was 2.2%.
We continue to see positive momentum from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be significant drivers of growth for us. We grew organically in every world region with the exception of Asia Pac, and we saw a growth from nearly every client sector. Our operating profit in the quarter increased to $225 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.7%. Diluted EPS was $0.38 a share and was $0.33 adjusting for certain below-the-line items, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year's second quarter.
For the first half of the year, organic revenue growth remained very strong at 5.1% and 5.4% excluding the impact of pass-throughs. Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points, and operating profit was up 10% for the 6 months, in which we also saw a similar 14% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q2. This performance continues a record of accomplishments in which our people can take great pride.
In terms of client sectors, leadership categories were tech and telecom, retail, food and beverage. U.S. organic growth was 4.6% in Q2, a very solid result given that it came on top of 7.7% growth a year ago. We saw growth in most of our agencies, led by R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. Internationally, LatAm grew 15.9% organically in Q2, an outstanding result. Organic growth was 1.2% in the U.K. where we did not see an impact from Brexit, while Continental Europe was approximately flat. In Asia Pac, our organic decrease was 3.2%, but was actually flat excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenues relating primarily to a major event in Hong Kong. This performance compares to Q2 2015 organic revenue growth of 11.8% in Asia Pac. 
In our other markets regions, organic growth was 7.3%, a result of strong increases in the Middle East and Canada.
Turning to share repurchase. During Q2, we used $59 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares, while over the trailing 12 months we've utilized approximately $296 million for share purchases. We had $346 million remaining on our authorization at the end of the quarter. Since instituting our return to capital programs in 2011, we've returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. To summarize, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in our digital expertise and in the world's key markets. 
At the midway point of the year, we believe we're well positioned with respect to our full year 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] financial targets. You may recall that on our last conference call, we upgraded our growth target to the high end of our original 3% to 4% organic growth range along with 50 basis points of more of operating margin expansion. We continue to be comfortable with these targets for the full year.
As expected, organic growth in the second quarter showed some moderation from our very strong first quarter increase. Within the quarter, we saw a growth in June that was a lower rate than in April and May. It bears noting that this was in part due to the timing of revenue, related to a couple of new business wins that we added in 2015. Based on client work already underway, we are confident that we will realize this revenue during the second half of the year. As we've always stated, revenue was variable by quarter, where total operating expenses are recognized more evenly across our 4 quarters. As a result, we expect to see higher rates of profit conversion on revenue growth in the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months. This would be consistent with our performance the last couple of years and it's why we feel that we are solidly on track with our objective to grow operating margin by 50 basis points or more this year.
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results, and I'll join you after his remarks."

Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter",1404,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael touched upon. Organic growth was 3.7% in the second quarter and was 5.1% for the 6 months. Q2 operating profit was $225 million with operating margin of 11.7%. For the 6 months, operating profit grew 9.9%, and operating margin expanded 40 basis points. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.38 and was $0.33 as adjusted, mainly for tax items, which is comparable to $0.29 a year ago. That's increase of 14%, and for the 6 months adjusted diluted EPS also increased 14%. Q2 average fully diluted shares decreased 1.9% from last year due to our share repurchase program.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Slide 4 has more detail on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2.2%. Compared to Q2 2015, the impact of the changing currency exchange rates was a negative 1.8%. Our net acquisitions added 30 basis points of revenue. Resulting organic revenue increase was 3.7%. Organic growth was higher at 4% when excluding the decrease in our pass-through revenues, which occurred mainly in our events and direct marketing businesses. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, at our Integrated Agency Network, the organic increase was 3.9%. This was led by digital offerings R/GA and Huge and by McCann and Mediabrands. IAN's first half organic growth was 5.6%.
At our CMG segment, organic growth was 2.8%, but was 5.1% excluding the decrease in pass-throughs that have no profit impact. We again have strong performance in public relations led by Weber Shandwick and in sports marketing at Octagon. For the 6 months, organic growth at CMG was 3% and 5% excluding pass-throughs.
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q2 organic growth was 4.6%, led by a range of agencies and disciplines including R/GA and Huge as well as McCann, MullenLowe, Mediabrands and Weber Shandwick. In the U.K., organic growth was 1.2%, which reflects growth in McCann, R/GA and Weber Shandwick partially offset by client sharing in other parts of the portfolio. Our U.K. operators are not citing any specific impact on client spending during the quarter related to the runup to the vote on Brexit.
Turning to Continental Europe organic growth was 0.5% in the quarter. We continue to see mixed performance in our largest markets, with organic increases in Italy and Spain offset by decreases in Germany and France. For the 6 months, organic growth was 1.1%.
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q2 was 3.2% and was flat excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. This comes on 11.8% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had mid-single-digit growth in China and India, while revenue decreased in Australia and Japan. For the 6 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 0.5%. In LatAm, Q2 organic growth was 15.9% with increases in nearly all of our largest national markets including Brazil, driven by increases in spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Huge. For the 6 months, organic growth was 13.9%. In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q2 at 7.3%, driven by Canada and the Middle East. Growth was also 7.3% for the 6 months.
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. Most recent data point is 5.6%.
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 2% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 2.2%. The FX impact to operating expenses was a negative 1.8%, which was the same impact we saw on our top line. Underneath our margin improvement in Q2, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 64.1% this year compared with 64.2% a year ago. The comparison is driven by leverage on our expenses for incentives and other SRS, partially offset by increased base payroll and severance as a percentage of revenue. A total headcount at quarter-end was approximately 50,100, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR.
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 24.2% of Q2 revenue compared with 24.3% a year ago, an improvement of 10 basis points. There were a couple of moving pieces worth noting in comparison. Compared to last year, we had a very strong leverage this year on our other O&G category. Recall that a year ago, we'd a higher reserve expense for certain contingencies which we took in other O&G. Offsetting that, last year, we also had a one-time lease buyout credit in our occupancy line. As a result, we delever on occupancy this year. A net result was an operating margin expansion of 20 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 6 months.
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.6%, which is an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago.
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our year-on-year over earnings per share comparison. This is the adjustment to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 we reported in the quarter to $0.33 per share for comparability to last year.
Starting on the upper half of this slide, our reported pretax results includes a below-the-line loss of $3.7 million, mostly noncash, related to the sale of small nonstrategic agencies. Our tax provision included a benefit of $2.7 million from our adoption earlier this year of a new accounting guidance on share-based compensation. We are presenting this adjustment as long as we are comparing 2016 to '15, but it falls away next year. The more significant adjustment in the quarter is from the conclusion and settlement of a tax examination of previous tax years. That was $23 million, as you can see, and benefited our reported EPS by $0.06. Total adjustment in Q2 is $0.05 per share due to rounding.
On the lower half, we show similar items covering the first 6 months and also include one of the reversal in tax valuation allowances as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses. For the 6 months, we are adjusting from $0.40 as reported to $0.33, again, as adjusted for comparability to 2015.
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $675 million in cash and short-term marketable securities. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peak at year-end.
Slide 11 is our second quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $94 million compared with $260 million a year ago. The comparison reflects the use of $128 million working capital this year compared to $42 million generated working capital a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile by quarter. Both this year and last year are within our historical range for Q2. Investing activities used $48 million, mainly from acquisition and capital expenditures. Financing activities used $67 million, chiefly for share repurchase, our common stock dividend and payments related to previous acquisitions, somewhat offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $5 million.
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.82 billion at the most recent quarter-end.
In summary, on Slide 13, we're exiting the first half having achieved 5.1% organic growth and 40 basis points of market expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. We're seeing growth in areas where we have focused our investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is in an important area that we continue to deploy for value going forward.
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Well, our Q2 results contributed to a strong first half that positions us to achieve our financial objectives for 2016. Across the group, our strategic, creative and digital capabilities are highly competitive. This was evident at the recent Cannes Festival, which, as many of you know, is the industry's most prestigious creative award show. Standards are so high that fewer than 3% of entries even make it to the short list of contenders, yet we won over 200 trophies. Our agencies were responsible for 2 of the 3 most awarded campaigns in Cannes, and we won 1 of only 5 coveted Titanium Lions. By our account, IPG was the most awarded holding company in terms of honors won per dollar of global revenue. Our long-standing commitment to integrated services, through our open architecture, model continues to be a strong differentiator for us because it puts the needs of our clients at the center of the solutions that we craft and deliver from across IPG assets. We're also proud that IPG and our agencies remain a destination of choice for so much of the industry's top talent and as we've been a long-term leader in the industry in terms of diversity and inclusion.
During both the quarter and the first 6 months, we further demonstrated disciplined cost management. We will stay focused on conversion so as to ensure that we can deliver on our margin improvement target for the year. We also continue to show that the work we had done over a number of years will bolster the company's financial fundamentals, including a substantially strengthened balance sheet and credit ratings are significant drivers of value creation. For some time now, our results have shown that investing in talent and focusing on a culture of accountability and performance are key drivers of success. We use strategic acquisitions to supplement the very high level of expertise and service delivery for which our agencies and our holding company have become known. Increasingly, we also invest in internal programs that promote innovation, such as the very successful accelerators we operate with R/GA, with a trial and partnerships with startups that take place through Mediabrands' emerging media lab. Of course, we also remain committed to substantial return of capital to our shareholders as a way to build value.
Moving on to the tone of the business. We've just completed our regular financial reviews with all of our operating leadership, and the environment remains sound overall. While results in the quarter reflects slower growth in June, there does not appear to be a market change in client sentiment. Instead, a couple of the large wins we posted in 2015 saw some revenue being deferred into the second half though with full year scopes of work that remain in line with our expectations. Given that the work is already well underway, we have a high degree of confidence in this revenue.
Certainly, there's a high degree of volatility due to Brexit and the geopolitical tensions we're seeing play out in places such as Europe and the Middle East. Brazil is also experiencing some turmoil, due to both the political situation and public health concerns. Globally, we're keeping a close eye on our event and other project businesses, which are often the first to see cancellations. While it seems that the situation in the U.K. will lead to slower decision-making and may affect certain client sectors, to date, our teams on the ground report limited impact from the referendum.
As you saw, our performance in Continental Europe was essentially flat with some markets seeing modest growth. The situation in that part of the world continues to be challenging, which could weigh on consumer sentiment and business activity. As previously indicated, we've built our plan for 2016 with very limited growth expectations for Europe. And in this sense, we further benefit from our limited exposure to the region.
Turning to the new business pipeline. There's a fair bit of overall activity. Media continues to be the most active sector followed by marketing services. These are both areas in which we've had good success in recent years. Our major global advertising-based networks are also seeing opportunities. And we're seeing quite a number of integrated RFPs coming into the holding company, for which we field cross-agency teams with our open architecture approach. Other than a few situations where a client has decided to limit participation to incumbents, we are active in most of the major pitches that are out there. Our performance in new business has been strong in the past few years, which is very gratifying. You've all heard me say that I also want our agencies and our people just as focused on providing great service to existing clients and growing with them organically, which we continue to see.
At the agency level, highlights in the quarter included very strong performance from R/GA and Huge, which continue to be among the industry's most innovative agencies, providing the full range of digital marketing services, including consulting with clients on digital business transformation, the connected space as well as storytelling across a range of new mediums and platforms.
McCann once again posted strong performance across all disciplines, notably in its Momentum unit, which won a major global sponsorship brief from SAP, and at MRM, which remains one of the leading global digital networks in the industry. The Worldgroup is also growing its relationships with recently won clients, notably Reckitt Benckiser. McCann saw further strong results in a range of awards and competitions, including Cannes, where McCann Health was named Network of the Year and McCann New York had a stellar performance.
MullenLowe showed strength in the quarter, notably domestically, as its Royal Caribbean campaign earned attention and acclaim and the agency won JetBlue's Barclaycard. MullenLowe also had a very active on a number of integrated open architecture teams, both domestic and international. And we hope to be able to announce some wins connected with those efforts in the near term.
At Mediabrands, results remain strong. The digital and accountable offerings within Mediabrands continue to be best-in-class and to power much of that unit's success. The performance of UM and its leadership has also been outstanding in recent years. On that front, we're pleased to confirm today that we've retained the BMW media AOR in the U.S. and Canada, another important win for UM and Mediabrands. Cannes was also a highlight for the group with a high degree of recognition for our work and the launch of the G100, a new brand assessment metric that has gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace.
Of course, on the media front, during the quarter, we saw the publication of the K2 report commissioned by the ANA. This relates to an issue that we at IPG have consistently handled in a highly proactive and transparent manner. As such, our conversations with clients relating to the report and the practices it alleges have been constructive. We continue to encourage dialogue on these matters, and we stand behind our record of transparency in our contracts as well as our dealing with clients and media vendors. IPG's performance in this regard has been consistently validated by a range of third-party experts employed by our clients. We're also proud of a long-standing commitment not to take inventory media positions. These practices allow us to bring a highly informed and wholly objective perspective to our engagements, so that we can consistently represent the best interest of our clients.
Another operating unit that posted strong performance in the quarter was CMG. We benefit from exceptionally deep and experienced leadership teams at all of our units within this group. Furthermore, as capturing consumer's attention becomes more difficult and valuable in a world of fragmented media, disciplines such as public relations, sports marketing, experiential campaigns and brand design will continue to increase in prominence. Notable wins in the quarter at Weber Shandwick included being named as the lead global public relations agency for General Motors' Chevrolet brand as well as their recent notable win at GSK.
FCB also showed further progress during the second quarter. The global Clorox win was an important step for the network. FCB's health care and shopper marketing capabilities remain among the industry's best, and for the second consecutive year, the agency posted its stronger ever performance in terms of awards won at Cannes.
The benefits of investing in talent, embedding digital expertise throughout our portfolio as well as raising our game strategically and creatively continues to be evident in the strength of our offerings across the portfolio. We're pleased with a high caliber of our people and capabilities. This is what has fueled our strong organic revenue performance during the first half of 2016.
Looking forward, despite increased macro uncertainty and the revenue timing that impacted our second quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver on the high end of our full year target of organic revenue of 3% to 4%. In terms of costs, we will stay diligent as the year progresses, and we remain closely focused on achieving the appropriate levels of conversion. Profit performance during the first half of this year showed meaningful improvement, and we are on track to expand full year operating margin by 50 basis points or better, consistent with our stated goal.
Combined with our company's financial strength and commitment to capital return, which has been and will continue to be a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your support, and we look forward to keeping you posted as the year unfolds.
With that, I'll open it up to questions."

We don't like to give out tailwinds because -- let me just comment here. It's so hard in this business.

We don't like them, but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that, and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins come into 2016, a number of them came at the end of the year. And frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is developed as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors, and the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year. And the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration a year performance. As I said before, our clients don't know what our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting, which is why we stick to our notion that given the macro environment, we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal, which includes revenue performance and our conversion. And the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years."

Some -- frankly, some clients don't care and, obviously, our competitors who have very strong performance in those markets reflect that. But I think overall, the more there is in terms of scrutiny of these type of positions, I think it will have an impact on the business and that's been our strategy.

Well, look, obviously, MRM is a very strong component of the Worldgroup and IPG, and we're always looking to add talent and strength in our offerings. We see it as a big opportunity at MRM at the Worldgroup in terms of cross disciplines as well as potentially using that in the open architecture environment. So yes, we're beefing up our expertise in that particular segment, and we believe that those opportunities will come as we strengthen their offerings. R/GA and Huge are very interesting examples of competency. They started out as pure-play digital agencies, and obviously, with the growth of digital, they've expanded dramatically. R/GA is a great textbook story of growing globally with success in the markets that they've opened in. R/GA, you can put up a shingle and, all of a sudden, you have strong businesses. Their reputation is second to none in terms of their space. And R/GA has done a great job of expanding their offerings focusing on the connected environment. And they're doing design, they're doing business transformation. So they've expanded their offering well beyond the typical digital play, if you will, and that's why we're seeing the great growth out of R/GA. Similarly, Huge has expanded. Remember, when we acquired Huge, we had 80 people in Brooklyn, New York. Now we have some 1,100, 1,200 people on a worldwide basis. And they've expanded their offerings as well in terms of different offerings and their go-to-market strategy in terms of business transformation, and frankly, expanding upon just a pure-play digital offering. And if you plug those 2 agencies in our open architecture model, frankly, there's hardly many companies that compete with the strength of our global networks plugging in our digital plays to supplement their own expertise, and that's practically the whole concept of open architecture. And it's a challenge for us, obviously, because those individuals are focused on growing their wonderful businesses, but again, they also see opportunity partnering with some of our agencies. In fact, some of the wins that we've seen, we've seen partnering of those digital -- whether it be Huge or R/GA with whether it be McCann, FCB or MullenLowe -- although MullenLowe has Profero, which is another digital agency, that is performing extremely well on a global basis. So it's not by accident and we see our digital agency growing double digit. And of course, the embedded digital expertise we have at Weber Shandwick and the experiential marketing in all of our networks themselves have very strong digital offerings. So that's why we don't break out digital, frankly, because digital is really throughout our offerings. So the concept of our open architecture is to provide the best talent we have within the expertise and bring the best to our clients, and frankly, it's working quite well. And hopefully, you'll see another win that reflects that in the next couple of weeks."

It has nothing to do with media ownership, which, obviously, is one of the confusing parts of pass-throughs from our competitors and us. And throughout the years, what we've been trying to do is change the contracts on these event engagements, because whether we act as an agent or not affects the accounting. What would happen is we will go out and outsource a lot of the people that are used in that engagement, and it's treated as a straight pass-through, but the accounting has it in our revenue and in our expenses, so we back out the pass-through. So it's not something that's a surprise to us, in fact -- and those pass-through numbers are actually coming down, because when we enter into contracts, we know that it's confusing from an accounting point of view so we try to structure the contracts to reflect it properly so that we don't find this.

So if you just throw a lot of money in Cannes, you can win more awards than anyone else. So we think a good way of looking at it is comparing awards per revenue. And when you do that, our agencies perform better. That's the way we look at it, of course, we're going to look at it that way. McCann was very strong this year in Cannes, and that's not by accident. McCann had a very strong emphasis on creativity. Rob Reilly and his team working with Harris and the rest of -- part of the McCann Worldgroup had a very strong effort in Cannes and the results are reflective of that. McCann New York in particular, it was great to see the awards they were winning, and of course, McCann Health was -- won the health care agency of the year. So it is an important factor. Every year, we look at the question of risk reward in terms of spending the kind of money we do in Cannes. No one asks for the person who performed the poorest in Cannes when we do reviews. So I believe we're going to continue to see a strong effort in terms of awards and to reflect the creative power of it. Creativity and effectiveness is a critical component of what we do, which is why FCB and MullenLowe, all of our agencies participate in it, but we pick and choose which to work we want to put in.

A lot of it was coming from the media owners, the TV owners, and a lot had to do with the upfront. Remember, last year's scatter, a lot of companies were caught flat in the scatter and had to pay higher pricing. So we saw an uptick on TV in the Upfront. And a lot of people read into that, therefore, the money going into digital is slowing and it's going back to TV. Our -- in the U.S., in terms of the spend, we see '16 sort of equal between digital and TV, and frankly, in '17, we believe digital will pass TV. So the growth of digital is slowing a bit because, look, it keeps getting bigger and bigger, but TV isn't going away. So our expertise is to help our clients decide where to put it. And some clients are happy with digital, and they spend more in digital. Other clients are concerned about the ad fraud and visibility, and are they getting the right ROIs in terms of bots and all of the ad blockers and so on, and they're more comfortable with TV. It's a question of what gives the clients the best ROI, and frankly, that's what we get paid to do, in terms of help our clients understand it.

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our third quarter organic revenue growth was 4.3% on top of a very strong 7.1% in Q3 '15. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 40 basis points while FX was a negative 1.7%. As a result, total revenue growth was 3%. 
We continue to see positive momentum in the quarter from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be very significant drivers of growth for us. 
As you remember, as of some years ago, we committed to organically building digital talent and expertise within every agency across our organization so as to effectively migrate to new competencies and serve the evolving needs of marketers. Our results demonstrate that this strategy continues to pay off. 
In terms of geography, we grew organically in every world region, with the exception of Asia Pac. Our international organic growth was 8.1%, driven by Continental Europe, the U.K. and LatAm. U.S. organic growth was 1.8% for the 3 months against extremely strong comparables in the quarter for 2 consecutive years. 
Globally, we continue to see growth from nearly every client industry and were led by the tech and telecom and food and beverage sectors. 
Turning to Q3 operating expenses and margin. Operating expenses increased 2.5% compared with reported revenue growth of 3%. And as a result, operating margin expanded 50 basis points from last year's third quarter to 10.8%, reflecting leverage on our salaries and related expenses. 
For the first 9 months of the year, organic growth was 4.8%. This was very well balanced with 4.8% growth in the U.S. and 4.9% internationally. It's worth noting that the charge in pass-through services added 90 basis points to our organic growth in the quarter and added 10 basis points through 9 months. 
Operating profit year-to-date is up 9%, and operating margin in the same period expanded 40 basis points, reaching the level of 11.7% for the trailing 12-month period, which is the highest level our company has achieved in well over a decade. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year through the third quarter compared to $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. 
Turning to our update on share repurchases. During Q3, we used $81 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized approximately $193 million repurchasing 8.5 million common shares. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%.  At the end of the third quarter, we had $265 million remaining on our current authorization. 
Overall, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies around the world and across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines. The strength and growth of digital activity is also notable. We continue to manage expenses effectively in order to deliver on our margin objectives, which has been a key priority for us. As we head into our always important fourth quarter, economic and political conditions continue to present macro uncertainties.  Nonetheless, the overall tone of business remains solid. 
We've also posted another good year in the new business front. And while the tailwinds from recent wins were relatively slight this past quarter due to timing, we expect the impact to be more evident in Q4. 
We have previously increased our full year 2016 organic growth target to the high end of 3% to 4% range that we shared with you coming into the year. In light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our organic growth target to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions, we have historically seen on our growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel that we remain well positioned to achieve 50 basis points or more of operating margin expansion for the full year '16. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for the additional detail of our results and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A. Frank?"

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touched upon. Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter and 4.8% for the first 9 months. Q3 operating profit was $207 million with operating margin of 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. For the 9 months, operating margin expanded 40 basis points and operating profit grew 9%.  Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.32 a share and was $0.31 adjusted for certain below-the-line items in the quarter. This compares to last year's diluted EPS of $0.27.  For the 9 months, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year compared with $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. Average fully diluted shares in Q3 decreased by 1.8% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3 you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting that our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which compares favorably to our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 '15 of 36%.  As you have seen in the past, we have volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect that our full year 2016 adjusted effective rate will be at the lower end of 37% to 39% range that we indicated earlier in the year. 
Slide 4 has more detail on our average -- on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Compared to Q3 '15, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a negative 1.7%.  Our net acquisitions added 40 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.3%. 
It's worth noting that net increase in pass-through revenue in the quarter mainly in our events business in the U.K. benefited organic growth by 90 basis points. For the 9 months, our change in pass-through revenue only increased organic revenue by 10 basis points. 
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3%. This was led by strong growth at McCann, R/GA and Huge. IAN's organic growth over the first 9 months was 4.7%. 
At our CMG segment, a marketing services specialist, organic growth was 9.4%. We again had strong performance at Weber Shandwick as well as our events business, Jack Morton, and our sports marketing at Octagon. Organic growth was 5.6% at CMG, excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenues.  For the 9 months, organic growth was 5.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was 1.8% on top of 7.1% in Q3 '15 and 7.9% in 2014. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue, organic revenue growth was 2%.  It is worth noting that acquisitions in the U.S. added another 60 basis points in the quarter. Leading client sectors were food and beverage and tech and telecom as well as our other sector of diverse clients.  Slower U.S. growth compared to the first half of this year was due to a less robust tailwind from the timing of account wins and to a particularly strong comp in the health care sector. 
In the U.K., organic growth was 16.4% and was 4.8% excluding the positive impact from higher pass-through revenues at our event specialist, Jack Morton. With continuing strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Octagon as well as Jack Morton, U.K. acquisitions add 3.9% to our growth in the quarter. By client sector, we were led by tech and telecom and health care.  It's worth noting that our U.K. operators are not citing a specific impact on client spending related to Brexit. 
Turning to Continental Europe. Organic growth was 8.3% in the quarter, a strong result driven by new business wins in the region. We had notable increases in the retail and food and beverage sectors led by Mediabrands and McCann in Germany and Spain among our largest markets. 
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q3 was 1.4%. This comes on top of 7.2% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had high single-digit growth in India, while revenues decreased in Australia and China. For the 9 months, our organic revenue decreased the [ph] region was 80 basis points. 
In LatAm, Q3 organic growth was a strong 17.8% on top of 14.4% growth a year ago with increases in all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Growth was driven by higher spend by existing clients and by new client wins.  We had notably strong performances from McCann, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Octagon and FutureBrand. For the 9 months, organic growth was 15.4%. 
In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q3 at 5.6%, driven by new business wins and by performance in Canada led by Mediabrands and Huge. Organic growth was 6.7% for the 9 months. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 4.9%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.5% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 3%. FX reduced our percentage of operating margin by 10 basis points in the quarter compared to last year but was neutral for the margin for 9 months. 
Underneath our margin improvement of 50 basis points in Q3, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 63.9% this year compared with 64.4% a year ago. The improvement was driven by year-on-year operating leverage on 2 categories: Our expense for incentives and for our category of other salaries and related expenses. This was partially offset by increased base payroll and temporary health as a percentage of revenue. 
Our total headcount at quarter end was approximately 50,400, an increase of 3.4% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of our growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with the same level a year ago. We leveraged our expenses for travel, supplies and telecom as well as for professional fees. That was offset by increased pass-through expenses as a percentage of revenue in our other O&G category.  The net result was operating margin expansion of 50 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 9 months. 
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.7%, which is an improvement of 60 basis points from a year ago. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our EPS adjustment in the quarter. We had a below-the-line gain of $3.9 million in other income, primarily due to the sale of a small nonstrategic business outside the U.S. Net benefit to our diluted EPS was $0.01. As you can see, the impact of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation was de minimis in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.31. 
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $895 million in cash and short term marketable securities, which is comparable to the level last year. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peek at year-end. 
Slide 11 is our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $520 million compared with $282 million a year ago. The comparison reflects increased cash generated from working capital this year, $318 million compared to $155 million a year ago.  As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile quarter by quarter. 
Investing activities used $65 million mainly for CapEx. Financing activities used $234 million chiefly for share repurchases and our common stock dividend as well as to decrease short-term borrowings.  Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $219 million. 
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, through 9 months, we have achieved 4.8% organic growth and 40 basis points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. 
We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused on investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Behind this strength are 2 very key strategic decisions that we took some time ago. The first was to invest in talent and foster a culture that makes us a top choice for talent in every marketing discipline and capability. Given how important compelling content is for any media, entertainment or communications company in the current environment, having the most outstanding creative strategic and digital talent has never been more vital for success, and we are well positioned in this regard. 
Now the talent priority that has long been key for us is our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a driver of business performance. An environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. We have reinforced this focus through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to achieve diversity objectives.  While Interpublic has made a great deal of progress and we take pride in that, as an industry, we still have a ways to go in this journey. 
The second major strategic decision is our approach to digital. Unlike some of our competitors, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our agencies. This investment in people with new skill sets in developing new products and services and in incubating new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. 
We want to be the first place clients turn to for help and guidance as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. We know that there are some questions out there about what technology convergence will mean to our industry going forward. We may all be facing new kinds of competitors. As more comes, IT and consulting come together. However, it's worth noting that to date, the emergence of technology-enabled marketing has created meaningful opportunity for the agency holding companies. This has definitely been the case for IPG given our skill set focused on digital, our media-agnostic view of channel allocation and a long-standing commitment to open architecture, where we've been an industry leader with this approach to delivering the best customized talent and solutions that can provide the integration of marketing functions our clients are increasingly asking for. 
What is not commonly understood is how much resource IPG already has in place across the group when it comes to data expertise, data analytics and proprietary tools that we can bring to bear in order to create accountable marketing campaigns that drive marketplace results. Data and analytics is an area we will continue to focus and invest behind so as to ensure that we can create even more targeted, dynamic and effective work on behalf of our clients. 
Moving on to operational results. It's clear that during the quarter and for the year-to-date, in addition to solid growth, we've continued to be very disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver our margin improvement target for the year. 
We also remain committed to the kind of robust capital return programs that we've put in place in recent years, which have been driving significant shareholder value creation. 
At the agency level, McCann Worldgroup's performance in the quarter was strong. Their creative product continue to earn high levels of industry recognition, and they're growing well in a number of their major clients.  Notable wins came from Reckitt Benckiser and Chick-fil-A as well as Qualcomm this past October.  We're seeing a high degree of collaboration among McCann advertising, MRM, Momentum and their strong health care offerings. 
Mediabrands, once again, made significant contributions to our profitability. UM has been building out its teams to deliver for recent global wins. Leading-edge capabilities like Cadreon and Ansible are also being introduced into a range of new international markets, and we added to the reprised SEO offering with an attractive acquisition based out of the U.K. that will serve as a regional center of excellence.  
Mediabrands also recently recruited strong new leaders for EMEA and Asia Pac regions.  Furthermore, in the quarter, they retained BMW North America and extended Coca-Cola in the Middle East. 
As mentioned last quarter, we have a long-standing record of transparency in our dealings with marketers and media vendors. We are proud of the role we play as wholly objective and media-agnostic advisers to our clients. 
At CMG, we saw a continued outstanding work out of Weber Shandwick. Some of you will have previously heard of point [ph] out that is the full range of Weber's digital capabilities from strategy through analytics all the way to content creation, where in a standalone company, it would be one of the largest social media agencies in the world. 
Octagon and Jack Morton were also strong performers in the quarter. 
MullenLowe continue to make headway in terms of integrating the network and promoted new leaders for its New York and London agencies, both our executives who came to the company through the acquisition of digital agency, Profero, which made important contributions to Q3 performance. MullenLowe also benefited from its bundled media offering, Mediahub, which continues to partner closely with Mediabrands as it did in the recent global win of Western Union. 
FCB is producing visible and successful new advertising work for clients, including AB InBev and a number of Chrysler brands, with work for new global client, Clorox, soon to follow.  The agency further bolstered its leadership with a significant creative hire. She will lead the creative group in the flagship Chicago office. 
FCB RED, the agency shopper marketing unit, is a market leader as our operations in a number of key emerging markets, including India, Brazil and South Africa. 
As you know, we have a range of full services domestic agencies, including Deutsche, Hill Holliday and the Martin Agency and Carmichael Lynch, which can serve clients independently or partner with other IPG units in the customized integrated offerings that we refer to as open architecture.  As mentioned earlier, this is a concept that we've been working to refine for some time. It has fueled many of our largest wins in recent years, including, recently, Harley-Davidson this quarter. And it's something you're now hearing more about from a number of our competitors. 
An additional highlight in the quarter was the performance of R/GA and Huge. These are among the industry's best digital networks. The strategic work they do for clients on digital transformation rival that of any consultancy. And the range of services they provide from UX and design to strategy, digital storytelling, data visualization and more is unrivaled in our industry.  Starting from a single agency in New York, both R/GA and Huge are evolving into powerful multi-office networks. In the case of R/GA, there are now 14 locations on 4 continents.  During the quarter, they posted major wins with Siemens and Mercedes-Benz. 
Huge has grown to 7 office -- U.S. offices and an equal number internationally, working with major clients, including Google, HBO and Under Armour. 
Looking forward, as mentioned in my opening remarks, the tone of the business remains solid. The new business pipeline is strong overall, and we are new -- [ph] business positive for year-to-date.  As indicated previously, tailwinds from recent wins with will be more prevalent in Q4 than they were in Q3, which we are sharing with you today. 
Investments in talent, supplemented by a measured and strategic approach to acquisitions, should ensure that the level of professional offerings remain highly competitive. And that's vital for us to capitalize on the level of complexity and even confusion that exists in today's marketing landscape. Despite the macro uncertainty that's out there due to political and economic factors at play around the globe, we're highly focused on delivering against our top and bottom line targets for the year. 
As stated at the outset, in light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our full year organic growth target from our previous 3% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions we have historically seen in our growth in the fourth quarter, we also believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our target of expanding 2016 operating margin by 50 basis points or more. 
Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital return, which has been a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we thank you for your support. We're intent on closing out the year strongly, and we look forward to posting you on our results at our next call. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I pushed on it because a couple of your peers also highlighted weakness in the U.S. organic growth. And when they reported earlier this week, some cited some election noise. I guess, any more color you can give on the underlying trend of the U.S. market will be great."

Let me just say, for the 9 months, our growth was 4.8% in the U.S., which still is a solid performance given where -- our forecast for the full year and what the industry is saying in terms of the macro growth of our industry. And yes, you pointed out correctly that in the third quarter, we're a little bit light in the U.S. compared to what we've been delivering. We've grown organically 15% in the last 2 years in the U.S. And obviously, as we grow, it gets a little bit more difficult. That said, the tailwinds that we refer to, we've indicated were light in the third quarter, the coming in the fourth quarter. I can't say -- again, it's a function of the fourth quarter. A lot of our revenue comes in, a lot of our operating margin comes in in the fourth quarter. I'd like to tell you that all of that tailwind comes in the U.S. and we're back to levels of organic growth that you've seen, but I can't say that. We do think there will be improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, but I think the health care item that Frank pointed out, we had a tough comp in that health care side, and we did have a little bit slowing down, in particular, in one of our agencies in terms of health care, and that contributed to it. But again, I'm very comfortable with a performance we have in the U.S. It continues to be a key driver for us going forward. What I like about our U.S. performance for the year is that it's across all of our agencies. We see MullenLowe, we see McCann, Mediabrands, CMG, our independent agencies, all of our agencies are strong in the U.S. and I believe, we will continue to see improvement in those markets."

We continue to have strong performance across the CMG portfolio as well as our agencies in the U.K. So we're pleased. R/GA, in particular, is very strong in the U.K. Management there and the offerings we see in R/GA is particularly strong and growing nicely. So we don't -- and as far as Brexit goes, as we said, we haven't seen any impact on Brexit yet. Obviously, sometime down the road, we'll see some impact, but we haven't seen it.
Continental Europe is a different story in that as you know, it's 8% of our revenue, at least for the 9 months. And new wins and client spend in that particular region has a nice affect, which is what you're seeing in this quarter with the results for Continental Europe. We said for out of full year basis, we've always said, we see 1% up or 1% down, it's encouraging that we seeing that kind of improvement. We saw good flow through in terms of new business at McCann as well as Mediabrands as they on-boarded some new client wins that we have in those markets, particularly in Germany and Spain. So we're excited to see some improvement in the Continental Europe again, we're not raising a flag of total victory in Continental Europe. They still have many challenges, but our client mix, if you will, is producing those kind of results."

Not, the least of which is these goals and cycles, and we're heading into the third of a third year of cycles and clients have 3-year contracts and has an order of business practice as they put a number of their businesses in review every 2 or 3 years. So I expect to see, I'll call that normal, it's not normal what it used to be, but it seems to be normal what's happening in our industry."

Look, data analytics is an important product. We historically -- we've done strategic acquisitions. We see most of our growth coming organically, for example, in Cadreon, we've seen -- we've expanded it internationally. We've coordinated their offerings among all resources and agencies within U.S. and we will continue to do that. So I think the bulk of the growth will come organically. However, we are looking at strategic acquisitions in that space. We also are looking at a more coordinated basis in terms of our database, if you will, in terms of a DMP. And that will be a key focus for us in 2017. To make sure that all the agencies within IPG have a consistent offering and utilizing the unique capabilities we have at Mediabrands. That's -- I see that as an important growth vehicle for us. Clients are looking for. That's the area where we're seeing a lot of competitors, if you will, trying to get you have inroads in our clients. So that's where -- and I talked about investment in data analytics, and we're going to be stepping up our efforts in those parts. And frankly, if we don't have it organically, and we don't have those capabilities internally, we will look to add on. Look, with Mediabrands, we added 2 very nice agencies this past year. One in the SEO space and one in the mobile space. Those are growth vehicles for us. Mobile, clearly, it's going to be a key driver for business going forward. Our Ansible offering, we've consolidated a number of businesses with the new acquisitions to make sure that we have full integrated mobile offering across our various brands. So this is the value of a holding company across all of our networks, and we continue to focus Mediabrands as the key source of providing those unique competencies utilizing these kinds of data."

We're constantly looking at that. So to the extent we can squeeze more out of O&G to help support those investments in talent and still meet our margin objectives, that's a good answer. But with that said, Michael mentioned 50% of our profits in the fourth quarter right, so I would imagine that our salary line is a contributor of leverage in the fourth quarter and as we move to '17 and '17 as well."

Let me start. 10 years ago, we started open architecture, okay? And it was our belief that clients -- in a client-centric environment, that we should be focusing on the needs of the clients, not our particular silos. And when we look at open architecture, the issue is do we, in essence, mold all of our agencies together and say by the way, here's the best people and irrespective of the silo. And obviously, there were complications, there were cultural issues, there are different go-to-market strategies and frankly, that served as well in the marketplace. We don't believe that we need to restructure our entire company to make open architecture work. We've been doing open architecture for 10 years. And frankly, some of our most profitable and growing clients utilize an open architecture model. And the reason it works is because we've made it part of the DNA of our organization. People within the ""silos"" know that if we they don't have the capabilities within their agencies, they can raise their hand, and we can bring in an expertise that will work closely with them on a collaborative basis and meet the needs of our clients. You don't need to restructure the entire company to do that. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we hold our agencies responsible for collaborative work. So when we do compensation and incentive compensation, we look at the degree of open architecture and collaboration. And on many of the engagements, there are multiple agencies serving one client, and they don't have to worry about whose silo they belong to because frankly, we do that. We work closely with agencies, and we determine what the proper allocation. Clients shouldn't be involved in it. We think that's a better way of doing this because when you have one single purpose agency doing this, we have a number of those, but most of the time, when you have a single-purpose agency, it's harder to recruit talent, it's harder to keep talent, it's harder to get a sustainability of the quality of the people within those agencies. And open architecture is serving us very well. We get the highest grades of our reviews when we have open architecture models because the clients realize that we're putting them first. And by the way, our definition of open architecture includes third party providers. So if our client come to us and say, we like you to work with XYZ in addition to your resources, sometimes we work better with third parties unfortunately than our own. But that's part of the model. If you collaborated everyone and put them all into 1 silo, you will never get that, okay? So I think the notion of providing all the resources IPG has to a client is the correct one, which is why frankly, we started it 10 years ago. But I don't believe you have to restructure the company to do that. You lose a lot of the culture, you lose a lot of the accountability, and you lose the focus that our core agencies have within those particular agencies."

So yes, we constantly looking at that and ensure that this positions that we've made are consistent. We're getting rid of nonproducing agencies that don't cost, that are costing us money and aren't getting any value. So that's what we've been doing. On the question of Cadreon and Mediabrands and whether we're decentralizing, it doesn't make sense to invest all of that money in one particular offering and not have it available for all the other agencies. When I first came to this business, I used to walk around, travel to our different agencies, and they were all real out what they believe is best-in-class offerings and particular, on the media side. And we we're spending a lot of money and a lot of things that we didn't have to duplicate if everyone be able to raise their hand and work closely with the competencies for example Mediabrands, whether the UM, initiative or Mediabrands as the holding company, if you will, of media. And I think that's the right way to do it. And we've done that terrific job on that. For example, if you look at MullenLowe and Mediabrands and Mediahub at MullenLowe working with Mediabrands on the Western Union pitch. I mean, that was a great example of competencies within an agency as well as tapping into particular resources we have in Mediabrands. The same thing is Harley-Davidson. The same thing in all of our open architecture wins. So I think that is the most efficient way to use our expertise and the most efficient way to meet the needs of our clients. And more of our agencies are realizing that they can do it that way, they get a better offering, and it's much more efficient and clients realize that they're looking out on their behalf instead of their own silo. Rather than that, I don't feel strongly about it, Brian."

New clients tend to have less margin than more mature clients, and that's a fact in our business. So what I'm tempering a little bit the expectation frankly, that as we onboard all those new business that we have, it's coming in very high margins and the margin number of expectations should be a lot higher than frankly, as this business matures as we go through it. That said, we do have some revenue coming into the fourth quarter that we've already incurred a significant amount of expenses. And obviously, that revenue comes with a higher margin. So this is not an exact science. The timing of how we get our revenue and how our expenses is fluid, if you will, because we have to manage to make sure we have the right people onboarding new business, as Frank said, but we also have the realize that expectations of new clients takes a period of time for it to mature. It just doesn't happen overnight, which is why even when we started the year everyone said, why are you being so conservative in terms of your organic growth and margin. And the answer to that is, staffing and onboarding new clients and macroeconomic all come into play at onetime.  It's a tricky thing to model, and that's why we like to look at this on a full year basis as opposed to quarter-to-quarter. So we manage it as best as we can, but if 50% of our [indiscernible] comes into the fourth quarter, we can't with a high degree of accuracy tell exactly where that's going to come."

In fact, that's one of the agencies we pull out when we have our piece that call for shopper marketing expertise because they do it so well. The more broader question on the convergence is really how we had to look at the transformation of our industry. I do believe we are seeing new competitors entering our business, and they are bringing with them CRM expertise. They're basically system integrators. And because they're already in our clients, they view it as an opportunity to bring in CRM expertise as well as creative, which is another reason why I think when we compete against those, the fact that we have standalone agencies with strong creative talent, it's very hard for these other parties to compete against whether McCann or an FCB or MullenLowe or our independent agencies the firepower we can bring in for creative work. There's no way that these new competitors if, if you will, come compete with that. And the results showed that. Even though these outliers, they were coming into our business are trying to get there, I think if you look across all the holding companies, we've been pretty successful when it comes to those integrated offerings that we provide versus what they're providing. That said, we had to watch it very carefully. And clearly, they're going to be coming out pretty strongly, so we have to be well suited. And I believe, the open architecture integrated offering is a very compelling argument against them trying to get into our business."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our third quarter organic revenue growth was 4.3% on top of a very strong 7.1% in Q3 '15. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 40 basis points while FX was a negative 1.7%. As a result, total revenue growth was 3%. 
We continue to see positive momentum in the quarter from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be very significant drivers of growth for us. 
As you remember, as of some years ago, we committed to organically building digital talent and expertise within every agency across our organization so as to effectively migrate to new competencies and serve the evolving needs of marketers. Our results demonstrate that this strategy continues to pay off. 
In terms of geography, we grew organically in every world region, with the exception of Asia Pac. Our international organic growth was 8.1%, driven by Continental Europe, the U.K. and LatAm. U.S. organic growth was 1.8% for the 3 months against extremely strong comparables in the quarter for 2 consecutive years. 
Globally, we continue to see growth from nearly every client industry and were led by the tech and telecom and food and beverage sectors. 
Turning to Q3 operating expenses and margin. Operating expenses increased 2.5% compared with reported revenue growth of 3%. And as a result, operating margin expanded 50 basis points from last year's third quarter to 10.8%, reflecting leverage on our salaries and related expenses. 
For the first 9 months of the year, organic growth was 4.8%. This was very well balanced with 4.8% growth in the U.S. and 4.9% internationally. It's worth noting that the charge in pass-through services added 90 basis points to our organic growth in the quarter and added 10 basis points through 9 months. 
Operating profit year-to-date is up 9%, and operating margin in the same period expanded 40 basis points, reaching the level of 11.7% for the trailing 12-month period, which is the highest level our company has achieved in well over a decade. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year through the third quarter compared to $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. 
Turning to our update on share repurchases. During Q3, we used $81 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized approximately $193 million repurchasing 8.5 million common shares. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. At the end of the third quarter, we had $265 million remaining on our current authorization. 
Overall, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies around the world and across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines. The strength and growth of digital activity is also notable. We continue to manage expenses effectively in order to deliver on our margin objectives, which has been a key priority for us. As we head into our always important fourth quarter, economic and political conditions continue to present macro uncertainties. Nonetheless, the overall tone of business remains solid. 
We've also posted another good year in the new business front. And while the tailwinds from recent wins were relatively slight this past quarter due to timing, we expect the impact to be more evident in Q4. 
We have previously increased our full year 2016 organic growth target to the high end of 3% to 4% range that we shared with you coming into the year. In light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our organic growth target to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions, we have historically seen on our growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel that we remain well positioned to achieve 50 basis points or more of operating margin expansion for the full year '16. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for the additional detail of our results and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A. Frank?"

Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the",1481,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning. As a reminder, I'll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. 
On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touched upon. Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter and 4.8% for the first 9 months. Q3 operating profit was $207 million with operating margin of 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. For the 9 months, operating margin expanded 40 basis points and operating profit grew 9%. Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.32 a share and was $0.31 adjusted for certain below-the-line items in the quarter. This compares to last year's diluted EPS of $0.27. For the 9 months, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year compared with $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. Average fully diluted shares in Q3 decreased by 1.8% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3 you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting that our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which compares favorably to our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 '15 of 36%. As you have seen in the past, we have volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect that our full year 2016 adjusted effective rate will be at the lower end of 37% to 39% range that we indicated earlier in the year. 
Slide 4 has more detail on our average -- on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Compared to Q3 '15, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was a negative 1.7%. Our net acquisitions added 40 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.3%. 
It's worth noting that net increase in pass-through revenue in the quarter mainly in our events business in the U.K. benefited organic growth by 90 basis points. For the 9 months, our change in pass-through revenue only increased organic revenue by 10 basis points. 
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3%. This was led by strong growth at McCann, R/GA and Huge. IAN's organic growth over the first 9 months was 4.7%. 
At our CMG segment, a marketing services specialist, organic growth was 9.4%. We again had strong performance at Weber Shandwick as well as our events business, Jack Morton, and our sports marketing at Octagon. Organic growth was 5.6% at CMG, excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenues. For the 9 months, organic growth was 5.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was 1.8% on top of 7.1% in Q3 '15 and 7.9% in 2014. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue, organic revenue growth was 2%. It is worth noting that acquisitions in the U.S. added another 60 basis points in the quarter. Leading client sectors were food and beverage and tech and telecom as well as our other sector of diverse clients. Slower U.S. growth compared to the first half of this year was due to a less robust tailwind from the timing of account wins and to a particularly strong comp in the health care sector. 
In the U.K., organic growth was 16.4% and was 4.8% excluding the positive impact from higher pass-through revenues at our event specialist, Jack Morton. With continuing strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Octagon as well as Jack Morton, U.K. acquisitions add 3.9% to our growth in the quarter. By client sector, we were led by tech and telecom and health care. It's worth noting that our U.K. operators are not citing a specific impact on client spending related to Brexit. 
Turning to Continental Europe. Organic growth was 8.3% in the quarter, a strong result driven by new business wins in the region. We had notable increases in the retail and food and beverage sectors led by Mediabrands and McCann in Germany and Spain among our largest markets. 
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q3 was 1.4%. This comes on top of 7.2% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had high single-digit growth in India, while revenues decreased in Australia and China. For the 9 months, our organic revenue decreased. The region was 80 basis points. 
In LatAm, Q3 organic growth was a strong 17.8% on top of 14.4% growth a year ago with increases in all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Growth was driven by higher spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performances from McCann, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Octagon and FutureBrand. For the 9 months, organic growth was 15.4%. 
In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q3 at 5.6%, driven by new business wins and by performance in Canada led by Mediabrands and Huge. Organic growth was 6.7% for the 9 months. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 4.9%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.5% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 3%. FX reduced our percentage of operating margin by 10 basis points in the quarter compared to last year but was neutral for the margin for 9 months. 
Underneath our margin improvement of 50 basis points in Q3, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 63.9% this year compared with 64.4% a year ago. The improvement was driven by year-on-year operating leverage on 2 categories: Our expense for incentives and for our category of other salaries and related expenses. This was partially offset by increased base payroll and temporary health as a percentage of revenue. 
Our total headcount at quarter end was approximately 50,400, an increase of 3.4% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of our growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with the same level a year ago. We leveraged our expenses for travel, supplies and telecom as well as for professional fees. That was offset by increased pass-through expenses as a percentage of revenue in our other O&G category. The net result was operating margin expansion of 50 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 9 months. 
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.7%, which is an improvement of 60 basis points from a year ago. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our EPS adjustment in the quarter. We had a below-the-line gain of $3.9 million in other income, primarily due to the sale of a small nonstrategic business outside the U.S. Net benefit to our diluted EPS was $0.01. As you can see, the impact of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation was de minimis in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.31. 
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $895 million in cash and short term marketable securities, which is comparable to the level last year. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peek at year-end. 
Slide 11 is our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $520 million compared with $282 million a year ago. The comparison reflects increased cash generated from working capital this year, $318 million compared to $155 million a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile quarter by quarter. 
Investing activities used $65 million mainly for CapEx. Financing activities used $234 million chiefly for share repurchases and our common stock dividend as well as to decrease short-term borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $219 million. 
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, through 9 months, we have achieved 4.8% organic growth and 40 basis points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. 
We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused on investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."
108616,403884547,1058693,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. Ther",1547,"Thank you, Frank. Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. There was very good balance among our agencies, geographic regions and most of all, client categories. 
Behind this strength are 2 very key strategic decisions that we took some time ago. The first was to invest in talent and foster a culture that makes us a top choice for talent in every marketing discipline and capability. Given how important compelling content is for any media, entertainment or communications company in the current environment, having the most outstanding creative strategic and digital talent has never been more vital for success, and we are well positioned in this regard. 
Now the talent priority that has long been key for us is our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a driver of business performance. An environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. We have reinforced this focus through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to achieve diversity objectives. While Interpublic has made a great deal of progress and we take pride in that, as an industry, we still have a ways to go in this journey. 
The second major strategic decision is our approach to digital. Unlike some of our competitors, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our agencies. This investment in people with new skill sets in developing new products and services and in incubating new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. 
We want to be the first place clients turn to for help and guidance as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. We know that there are some questions out there about what technology convergence will mean to our industry going forward. We may all be facing new kinds of competitors. As more comes, IT and consulting come together. However, it's worth noting that to date, the emergence of technology-enabled marketing has created meaningful opportunity for the agency holding companies. This has definitely been the case for IPG given our skill set focused on digital, our media-agnostic view of channel allocation and a long-standing commitment to open architecture, where we've been an industry leader with this approach to delivering the best customized talent and solutions that can provide the integration of marketing functions our clients are increasingly asking for. 
What is not commonly understood is how much resource IPG already has in place across the group when it comes to data expertise, data analytics and proprietary tools that we can bring to bear in order to create accountable marketing campaigns that drive marketplace results. Data and analytics is an area we will continue to focus and invest behind so as to ensure that we can create even more targeted, dynamic and effective work on behalf of our clients. 
Moving on to operational results. It's clear that during the quarter and for the year-to-date, in addition to solid growth, we've continued to be very disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver our margin improvement target for the year. 
We also remain committed to the kind of robust capital return programs that we've put in place in recent years, which have been driving significant shareholder value creation. 
At the agency level, McCann Worldgroup's performance in the quarter was strong. Their creative product continue to earn high levels of industry recognition, and they're growing well in a number of their major clients. Notable wins came from Reckitt Benckiser and Chick-fil-A as well as Qualcomm this past October. We're seeing a high degree of collaboration among McCann advertising, MRM, Momentum and their strong health care offerings. 
Mediabrands, once again, made significant contributions to our profitability. UM has been building out its teams to deliver for recent global wins. Leading-edge capabilities like Cadreon and Ansible are also being introduced into a range of new international markets, and we added to the reprised SEO offering with an attractive acquisition based out of the U.K. that will serve as a regional center of excellence. 
Mediabrands also recently recruited strong new leaders for EMEA and Asia Pac regions. Furthermore, in the quarter, they retained BMW North America and extended Coca-Cola in the Middle East. 
As mentioned last quarter, we have a long-standing record of transparency in our dealings with marketers and media vendors. We are proud of the role we play as wholly objective and media-agnostic advisers to our clients. 
At CMG, we saw a continued outstanding work out of Weber Shandwick. Some of you will have previously heard, it was pointed out, that is the full range of Weber's digital capabilities from strategy through analytics all the way to content creation, where in a standalone company, it would be one of the largest social media agencies in the world. 
Octagon and Jack Morton were also strong performers in the quarter. 
MullenLowe continue to make headway in terms of integrating the network and promoted new leaders for its New York and London agencies, both our executives who came to the company through the acquisition of digital agency, Profero, which made important contributions to Q3 performance. MullenLowe also benefited from its bundled media offering, Mediahub, which continues to partner closely with Mediabrands as it did in the recent global win of Western Union. 
FCB is producing visible and successful new advertising work for clients, including AB InBev and a number of Chrysler brands, with work for new global client, Clorox, soon to follow. The agency further bolstered its leadership with a significant creative hire. She will lead the creative group in the flagship Chicago office. 
FCB RED, the agency shopper marketing unit, is a market leader as our operations in a number of key emerging markets, including India, Brazil and South Africa. 
As you know, we have a range of full services domestic agencies, including Deutsche, Hill Holliday and the Martin Agency and Carmichael Lynch, which can serve clients independently or partner with other IPG units in the customized integrated offerings that we refer to as open architecture. As mentioned earlier, this is a concept that we've been working to refine for some time. It has fueled many of our largest wins in recent years, including, recently, Harley-Davidson this quarter. And it's something you're now hearing more about from a number of our competitors. 
An additional highlight in the quarter was the performance of R/GA and Huge. These are among the industry's best digital networks. The strategic work they do for clients on digital transformation rival that of any consultancy. And the range of services they provide from UX and design to strategy, digital storytelling, data visualization and more is unrivaled in our industry. Starting from a single agency in New York, both R/GA and Huge are evolving into powerful multi-office networks. In the case of R/GA, there are now 14 locations on 4 continents. During the quarter, they posted major wins with Siemens and Mercedes-Benz. 
Huge has grown to 7 office -- U.S. offices and an equal number internationally, working with major clients, including Google, HBO and Under Armour. 
Looking forward, as mentioned in my opening remarks, the tone of the business remains solid. The new business pipeline is strong overall, and we are new -- business positive for year-to-date. As indicated previously, tailwinds from recent wins with will be more prevalent in Q4 than they were in Q3, which we are sharing with you today. 
Investments in talent, supplemented by a measured and strategic approach to acquisitions, should ensure that the level of professional offerings remain highly competitive. And that's vital for us to capitalize on the level of complexity and even confusion that exists in today's marketing landscape. Despite the macro uncertainty that's out there due to political and economic factors at play around the globe, we're highly focused on delivering against our top and bottom line targets for the year. 
As stated at the outset, in light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our full year organic growth target from our previous 3% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions we have historically seen in our growth in the fourth quarter, we also believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our target of expanding 2016 operating margin by 50 basis points or more. 
Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital return, which has been a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we thank you for your support. We're intent on closing out the year strongly, and we look forward to posting you on our results at our next call. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Given the tailwinds are supposed to pick up in Q4, is there an unusually difficult comp in Q4? I guess, how should we think about sort of the underlying growth rate of the U.S.? I pushed on it because a couple of your peers also highlighted weakness in the U.S. organic growth. And when they reported earlier this week, some cited some election noise.

And yes, you pointed out correctly that in the third quarter, we're a little bit light in the U.S. compared to the -- what we've been delivering. We've grown organically 15% in the last 2 years in the U.S. And obviously, as we grow, it gets a little more difficult. That said, the tailwinds that we refer to, we've indicated, were light in the third quarter. They're coming in, in the fourth quarter. I can't say -- again, it's a function of the fourth quarter. A lot of our revenue comes in, a lot of our operating margin comes in, in the fourth quarter. I'd like to tell you that all of that tailwind comes in at the U.S. and we're back to levels of organic growth that you've seen, but I can't say that. We do think there'll be improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But I think the health care item that Frank pointed out, we had a tough comp in the health care side, and we did have a little bit slowing down, in particular, in one of our agencies in terms of health care, and that contributed to it. But again, I'm very comfortable with the performance we have in the U.S. It continues to be a key driver for us going forward. What I like about our U.S. performance for the year is that it's across all of our agencies. We see MullenLowe, we see McCann, Mediabrands, CMG, our independent agencies. All of our agencies are strong in the U.S., and I believe we will continue to see improvement in those markets."

We said for -- on a full year basis, we've always said we'd see 1% up or 1% down. It's encouraging that we're seeing that kind of improvement. We saw a good flow-through in terms of new business at McCann as well as Mediabrands as they onboarded some new client wins that we had in those markets, particularly in Germany and Spain.

We've coordinated their offerings among all resources and agencies within U.S., and we will continue to do that. So I think the bulk of the growth will come organically. However, we are looking at strategic acquisitions in that space. We also are looking at a more coordinated basis in terms of our database, if you will, in terms of a DMP. And that will be a key focus for us in 2017, to make sure that all the agencies within IPG have a consistent offering and utilizing the unique capabilities we have at Mediabrands. That's -- I see that as an important growth vehicle for us. Clients are looking for it. That's the area where we're seeing a lot of competitors, if you will, trying to get -- have inroads in our clients. So that's where -- and I talk about investment in data and analytics, and we're going to be stepping up our efforts in those parts. And frankly, if we don't have it organically and we don't have those capabilities internally, we will look to add on. So look, with Mediabrands, we added 2 very nice agencies this past year, one in the SEO space and one in the mobile space. Those are growth vehicles for us. Mobile, clearly, is going to be a key driver for business going forward. Our Ansible offering, we consolidated a number of businesses with the new acquisitions to make sure that we have full integrated mobile offering across our various brands.

Let me start. 10 years ago, we started open architecture, okay? And it was our belief that clients -- in a client-centric environment that we should be focusing on the needs of the clients, not our particular silos. And when we looked at open architecture, the issue is do we, in essence, mold all of our agencies together and say, by the way, here's our best people and irrespective of where the silo is. And obviously, there are conflict issues. There are cultural issues. There are different go-to-market strategies. And frankly, that serves us well in the marketplace. We don't believe that we need to restructure our entire company to make open architecture work. We've been doing open architecture for 10 years. And frankly, some of our most profitable and growing clients utilize an open architecture model. And the reason it works is because we've made it part of the DNA of our organization. People within the ""silos"" know that if they don't have the capabilities within their agencies, they can raise their hand, and we can bring in an expertise that will work closely with them on a collaborative basis and meet the needs of our clients. You don't need to restructure the entire company to do that. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we hold our agencies responsible for collaborative work. So when we do compensation and incentive compensation, we look at the degree of open architecture and collaboration. And on many of engagements, there are multiple agencies serving one client. And they don't have to worry about whose silo it belongs in because, frankly, we do that. We work closely with the agencies, and we determine what's the proper allocation. Clients shouldn't be involved in it. We think that's a better way of doing this because when you have one single-purpose agency doing this -- we have a number of those. But most of the time, when you have a single-purpose agency, it's harder to recruit talent, it's harder to keep talent, it's harder to get a sustainability of the quality of the people within those agencies. And open architecture is serving us very well. We get the highest grades of our reviews when we have open architecture models because the clients realize that we're putting them first. And by the way, our definition of open architecture includes third-party providers. So if our clients come to us and say, ""We like you to work with XYZ in addition to your resources,"" sometimes we work better with third parties, unfortunately, than our own. But that's part of the model. If you collaborated everyone and put them all into one silo, you will never get that, okay? So I think the notion of providing all the resources IPG has to a client is the correct one, which is why, frankly, we started it 10 years ago. But I don't believe you have to restructure the company to do that. You'll lose a lot of the culture. You'll lose a lot of the accountability, and you'll lose the focus that our core agencies have within those particular agencies."

So yes, we're constantly looking at that, ensure -- to ensure the dispositions that we've made are consistent with getting rid of nonproducing agencies that don't cost -- that are costing us money and aren't adding any value. So that's what we've been doing. On the question of Cadreon and Mediabrands and whether we're decentralizing, it doesn't make sense to invest all of that money in one particular offering and not have it available for all the other agencies. When I first came to this business, I used to walk around -- I traveled to our different agencies, and they would all wheel out what they believed is best-in-class offerings, in particular, on the media side. And we were spending a lot of money and a lot of things that we didn't have to duplicate if everyone were able to raise their hand and work closely with the competencies in, for example, Mediabrands, whether it be UM initiative or Mediabrands as the holding company, if you will, of media. And I think that's the right way to do it. And we've done that -- a terrific job on that. For example, if you look at MullenLowe and Mediabrands and Mediahub at MullenLowe working with Mediabrands on the Western Union pitch. I mean, that was a great example of competencies within an agency as well as tapping into particular resources we have in Mediabrands. The same thing is Harley-Davidson. The same thing in all of our open architecture wins. So I think that is the most efficient way to use our expertise and the most efficient way to meet the needs of our clients. And more and more of our agencies are realizing that if they can do it that way, they get a better offering, and it's much more efficient and clients realize that they're looking out for their behalf instead of their own silo. Other than that, I don't feel strongly about it, Brian."

New clients tend to have less margin than more mature clients, and that's a fact in our business. And so what -- I'm tempering a little bit the expectation, frankly, that as we onboard all this new business that we have, it's coming in at very high margins and the margin number of expectations should be a lot higher than, frankly, as this business matures as we go through it. That said, we do have some revenue coming in, in the fourth quarter that we've already incurred a significant amount of expenses. And obviously, that revenue comes with a higher margin. So this is not an exact science. The timing of how we get our revenue and how our expenses is fluid, if you will, because we have to manage to make sure we have the right people onboarding new business, as Frank said. But we also have to realize that expectations of new clients takes a period of time for it to mature. It just doesn't happen overnight, which is why even when we started the year, everyone said, ""Well, why are you being so conservative in terms of your organic growth and margin?"" And the answer to that is staffing and onboarding new clients and macroeconomics all coming into play at onetime. It's a tricky thing to model, and that's why we like to look at this on a full year basis as opposed to quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So we manage it as best we can. But as -- if 50% of our margin comes, in, in the fourth quarter, we can't with a high degree of accuracy tell exactly where that's going to come."

My question was on shopper marketing more broadly across IPG as it's an area that one of your peers has cited as a bit of a challenging one recently. It sounds like it's a bit more of a positive story for you. Could you maybe remind us the size of that discipline across all of IPG, your short- and near-term views on it? And in particular, maybe the difference between how it performs domestically in emerging markets and maybe how it's evolving towards digital. And then one other just high-level question. You also commented on the continued convergence of the consultants and systems integrators. Just anything that you're seeing that's changing there, in particular, seeing some of those competitors maybe starting to look at creative or media as opposed to sort of strategy and technology work, that would be great."

Shopper marketing, it's important to -- FCB to have a great competency in it. I would say it's not big overall. I don't -- I wouldn't say it's a major part of our business at IPG as a whole. That said, there are opportunities for those agencies that offer it on a very effective basis, and we will continue to invest behind it when we see opportunities. But I wouldn't call it out as one of the major growth vehicles around the world, if you will. But it is very important to FCB, and they do a great job at it. In fact, that's one of the agencies we pull out when we have our piece that call for shopper marketing expertise because they do it so well. The more broader question on the convergence is really how we have to look at the transformation of our industry. I do believe we are seeing new competitors entering our business, and they are bringing with them CRM expertise. They're basically system integrators. And because they're already in our clients, they view it as an opportunity to bring in CRM expertise as well as creative, which is another reason why I think when we compete against those, the fact that we have standalone agencies with strong creative talent, it's very hard for these other parties to compete against, whether McCann or an FCB or MullenLowe or our independent agencies, the firepower we can bring in on creative work. There's no way that these new competitors, if you will, can compete with that. So -- and the results show that. Even though these outliers that were coming into our business are trying to get there, I think if you look across all the holding companies, we've been pretty successful when it comes to those integrated offerings that we provide versus what they're providing. That said, we have to watch it very carefully. And clearly, they're going to be coming at it pretty strongly, so we have to be well suited. And I believe the open architecture integrated offering is a very compelling argument against them trying to get into our business."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our third quarter organic revenue growth was 4.3% on top of a very strong 7.1% in Q3 '15. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 40 basis points while FX was a negative 1.7%. As a result, total revenue growth was 3%. 
We continue to see positive momentum in the quarter from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be very significant drivers of growth for us. 
As you'll remember, as of some years ago, we committed to organically building digital talent and expertise within every agency across our organization so as to effectively migrate to new competencies and serve the evolving needs of marketers. Our results demonstrate that this strategy continues to pay off. 
In terms of geography, we grew organically in every world region, with the exception of Asia Pac. Our international organic growth was 8.1%, driven by Continental Europe, the U.K. and LatAm. U.S. organic growth was 1.8% for the 3 months against extremely strong comparables in the quarter for 2 consecutive years. 
Globally, we continue to see growth from nearly every client industry and were led by the tech and telecom and food and beverage sectors. 
Turning to Q3 operating expenses and margin. Operating expenses increased 2.5% compared with reported revenue growth of 3%. And as a result, operating margin expanded 50 basis points from last year's third quarter to 10.8%, reflecting leverage on our salaries and related expenses. 
For the first 9 months of the year, organic growth was 4.8%. This was very well balanced with 4.8% growth in the U.S. and 4.9% internationally. It's worth noting that the charge in pass-through services added 90 basis points to our organic growth in the quarter and added 10 basis points through 9 months. 
Operating profit year-to-date is up 9%, and operating margin in the same period expanded 40 basis points, reaching the level of 11.7% for the trailing 12-month period, which is the highest level our company has achieved in well over a decade. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year through the third quarter compared to $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. 
Turning to our update on share repurchases. During Q3, we used $81 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized approximately $193 million repurchasing 8.5 million common shares. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. At the end of the third quarter, we had $265 million remaining on our current authorization. 
Overall, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies around the world and across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines. The strength and growth of digital activity is also notable. We continue to manage expenses effectively in order to deliver on our margin objectives, which has been a key priority for us. As we head into our always important fourth quarter, economic and political conditions continue to present macro uncertainties. Nonetheless, the overall tone of business remains solid. 
We've also posted another good year in the new business front. And while the tailwinds from recent wins were relatively slight this past quarter due to timing, we expect the impact to be more evident in Q4. 
We have previously increased our full year 2016 organic growth target to the high end of 3% to 4% range that we shared with you coming into the year. In light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our organic growth target to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions, we have historically seen on our growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel that we remain well positioned to achieve 50 basis points or more of operating margin expansion for the full year '16. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for the additional detail of our results and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A. Frank?"

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touched upon. Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter and 4.8% for the first 9 months. Q3 operating profit was $207 million with operating margin of 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. For the 9 months, operating margin expanded 40 basis points and operating profit grew 9%. Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.32 a share and was $0.31 adjusted for certain below-the-line items in the quarter. This compares to last year's diluted EPS of $0.27. For the 9 months, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year compared with $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. Average fully diluted shares in Q3 decreased by 1.8% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3 you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting that our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which compares favorably to our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 '15 of 36%. As you have seen in the past, we have volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect that our full year 2016 adjusted effective rate will be at the lower end of 37% to 39% range that we indicated earlier in the year. 
Slide 4 has more detail on our average -- on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Compared to Q3 '15, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was negative 1.7%. Our net acquisitions added 40 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.3%. 
It's worth noting that net increase in pass-through revenue in the quarter mainly in our events business in the U.K. benefited organic growth by 90 basis points. For the 9 months, our change in pass-through revenue only increased organic revenue by 10 basis points. 
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3%. This was led by strong growth at McCann, R/GA and Huge. IAN's organic growth over the first 9 months was 4.7%. 
At our CMG segment, a marketing services specialist, organic growth was 9.4%. We again had strong performance at Weber Shandwick as well as our events business, Jack Morton, and our sports marketing at Octagon. Organic growth was 5.6% at CMG, excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenues. For the 9 months, organic growth was 5.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was 1.8% on top of 7.1% in Q3 '15 and 7.9% in 2014. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue, organic revenue growth was 2%. It is worth noting that acquisitions in the U.S. added another 60 basis points in the quarter. Leading client sectors were food and beverage and tech and telecom as well as our other sector of diverse clients. Slower U.S. growth compared to the first half of this year was due to a less robust tailwind from the timing of account wins and to a particularly strong comp in the health care sector. 
In the U.K., organic growth was 16.4% and was 4.8% excluding the positive impact from higher pass-through revenues at our events specialist, Jack Morton. With continuing strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Octagon as well as Jack Morton, U.K. acquisitions add 3.9% to our growth in the quarter. By client sector, we were led by tech and telecom and health care. It's worth noting that our U.K. operators are not citing a specific impact on client spending related to Brexit. 
Turning to Continental Europe. Organic growth was 8.3% in the quarter, a strong result driven by new business wins in the region. We had notable increases in the retail and food and beverage sectors led by Mediabrands and McCann in Germany and Spain among our largest markets. 
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q3 was 1.4%. This comes on top of 7.2% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had high single-digit growth in India, while revenues decreased in Australia and China. For the 9 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 80 basis points. 
In LatAm, Q3 organic growth was a strong 17.8% on top of 14.4% growth a year ago with increases in all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Growth was driven by higher spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performances from McCann, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Octagon and FutureBrand. For the 9 months, organic growth was 15.4%. 
In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q3 at 5.6%, driven by new business wins and by performance in Canada led by Mediabrands and Huge. Organic growth was 6.7% for the 9 months. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 4.9%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.5% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 3%. FX reduced our percentage of operating margin by 10 basis points in the quarter compared to last year but was neutral for the margin for 9 months. 
Underneath our margin improvement of 50 basis points in Q3, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 63.9% this year compared with 64.4% a year ago. The improvement was driven by year-on-year operating leverage on 2 categories: Our expense for incentives and for our category of other salaries and related expenses. This was partially offset by increased base payroll and temporary help as a percentage of revenue. 
Our total headcount at quarter end was approximately 50,400, an increase of 3.4% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of our growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with the same level a year ago. We leveraged our expenses for travel, supplies and telecom as well as for professional fees. That was offset by increased pass-through expenses as a percentage of revenue in our other O&G category. The net result was operating margin expansion of 50 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 9 months. 
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.7%, which is an improvement of 60 basis points from a year ago. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our EPS adjustment in the quarter. We had a below-the-line gain of $3.9 million in other income, primarily due to the sale of a small nonstrategic business outside the U.S. Net [ph] benefit to our diluted EPS was $0.01. As you can see, the impact of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation was de minimis in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.31. 
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $895 million in cash and short term marketable securities, which is comparable to the level last year. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peek at year-end. 
Slide 11 is our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $520 million compared with $282 million a year ago. The comparison reflects increased cash generated from working capital this year, $318 million compared to $155 million a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile quarter by quarter. 
Investing activities used $65 million mainly for CapEx. Financing activities used $234 million chiefly for share repurchases and our common stock dividend as well as to decrease short-term borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $219 million. 
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, through 9 months, we have achieved 4.8% organic growth and 40 basis points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. 
We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused on investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."
108616,403884547,1058900,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. Ther",1544,"Thank you, Frank. Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. There was very good balance among our agencies, geographic regions and most of all, client categories. 
Behind this strength are 2 very key strategic decisions that we took some time ago. The first was to invest in talent and foster a culture that makes us a top choice for talent in every marketing discipline and capability. Given how important compelling content is for any media, entertainment or communications company in the current environment, having the most outstanding creative strategic and digital talent has never been more vital for success, and we are well positioned in this regard. 
Another talent priority that has long been key for us is our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a driver of business performance. An environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. We have reinforced this focus through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to achieve diversity objectives. While Interpublic has made a great deal of progress and we take pride in that, as an industry, we still have a ways to go in this journey. 
The second major strategic decision is our approach to digital. Unlike some of our competitors, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our agencies. This investment in people with new skill sets in developing new products and services and in incubating new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. 
We want to be the first place clients turn to for help and guidance as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. We know that there are some questions out there about what technology convergence will mean to our industry going forward. We may all be facing new kinds of competitors. As marcoms, IT and consulting come together. However, it's worth noting that to date, the emergence of technology-enabled marketing has created meaningful opportunity for the agency holding companies. This has definitely been the case for IPG given our skill set focused on digital, our media-agnostic view of channel allocation and a long-standing commitment to open architecture, where we've been an industry leader with this approach to delivering the best customized talent and solutions that can provide the integration of marketing functions our clients are increasingly asking for. 
What is not commonly understood is how much resource IPG already has in place across the group when it comes to data expertise, data analytics and proprietary tools that we can bring to bear in order to create accountable marketing campaigns that drive marketplace results. Data and analytics is an area we will continue to focus and invest behind so as to ensure that we can create even more targeted, dynamic and effective work on behalf of our clients. 
Moving on to operational results. It's clear that during the quarter and for the year-to-date, in addition to solid growth, we've continued to be very disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver our margin improvement target for the year. 
We also remain committed to the kind of robust capital return programs that we've put in place in recent years, which have been driving significant shareholder value creation. 
At the agency level, McCann Worldgroup's performance in the quarter was strong. Their creative product continue to earn high levels of industry recognition, and they're growing well in a number of their major clients. Notable wins came from Reckitt Benckiser and Chick-fil-A as well as Qualcomm this past October. We're seeing a high degree of collaboration among McCann advertising, MRM, Momentum and their strong health care offerings. 
Mediabrands, once again, made significant contributions to our profitability. UM has been building out its teams to deliver for recent global wins. Leading-edge capabilities like Cadreon and Ansible are also being introduced into a range of new international markets, and we added to the reprised SEO offering with an attractive acquisition based out of the U.K. that will serve as a regional center of excellence. 
Mediabrands also recently recruited strong new leaders for EMEA and Asia Pac regions. Furthermore, in the quarter, they retained BMW North America and extended Coca-Cola in the Middle East. 
As mentioned last quarter, we have a long-standing record of transparency in our dealings with marketers and media vendors. We are proud of the role we play as wholly objective and media-agnostic advisers to our clients. 
At CMG, we saw a continued outstanding work out of Weber Shandwick. Some of you will have previously heard, it was pointed out, that is the full range of Weber's digital capabilities from strategy through analytics all the way to content creation or in a standalone company, it would be one of the largest social media agencies in the world. 
Octagon and Jack Morton were also strong performers in the quarter. 
MullenLowe continue to make headway in terms of integrating the network and promoted new leaders for its New York and London agencies, both our executives who came to the company through the acquisition of digital agency, Profero, which made important contributions to Q3 performance. MullenLowe also benefited from its bundled media offering, Mediahub, which continues to partner closely with Mediabrands as it did in the recent global win of Western Union. 
FCB is producing visible and successful new advertising work for clients, including AB InBev and a number of Chrysler brands, with work for new global client, Clorox, soon to follow. The agency further bolstered its leadership with a significant creative hire. She will lead the creative group in the flagship Chicago office. 
FCB RED, the agency shopper marketing unit, is a market leader as our operations in a number of key emerging markets, including India, Brazil and South Africa. 
As you know, we have a range of full services domestic agencies, including Deutsche, Hill Holliday and The Martin Agency and Carmichael Lynch, which can serve clients independently or partner with other IPG units in the customized integrated offerings that we refer to as open architecture. As mentioned earlier, this is a concept that we've been working to refine for some time. It has fueled many of our largest wins in recent years, including, recently, Harley-Davidson this quarter. And it's something you're now hearing more about from a number of our competitors. 
An additional highlight in the quarter was the performance of R/GA and Huge. These are among the industry's best digital networks. The strategic work they do for clients on digital transformation rivals that of any consultancy. And the range of services they provide from UX and design to strategy, digital storytelling, data visualization and more, is unrivaled in our industry. Starting from a single agency in New York, both R/GA and Huge are evolving into powerful multi-office networks. In the case of R/GA, there are now 14 locations on 4 continents. During the quarter, they posted major wins with Siemens and Mercedes-Benz. 
Huge has grown to 7 office -- U.S. offices and an equal number internationally, working with major clients, including Google, HBO and Under Armour. 
Looking forward, as mentioned in my opening remarks, the tone of the business remains solid. The new business pipeline is strong overall, and we are new business positive for year-to-date. As indicated previously, tailwinds from recent wins with will be more prevalent in Q4 than they were in Q3, which we are sharing with you today. 
Investments in talent, supplemented by a measured and strategic approach to acquisitions, should ensure that the level of professional offerings remain highly competitive. And that's vital for us to capitalize on the level of complexity and even confusion that exists in today's marketing landscape. Despite the macro uncertainty that's out there due to political and economic factors at play around the globe, we're highly focused on delivering against our top and bottom line targets for the year. 
As stated at the outset, in light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our full year organic growth target from our previous 3% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions we have historically seen in our growth in the fourth quarter, we also believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our target of expanding 2016 operating margin by 50 basis points or more. 
Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital return, which has been a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we thank you for your support. We're intent on closing out the year strongly, and we look forward to posting you on our results at our next call. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I think you -- Frank, I think you highlighted a very difficult comp on the health care side and then obviously, a little bit less tailwinds I think you both had in terms of new business in the quarter. Given the tailwinds are supposed to pick up in Q4, is there an unusually difficult comp in Q4? I guess, how should we think about sort of the underlying growth rate of the U.S.? I pushed on it because a couple of your peers also highlighted weakness in the U.S. organic growth. And when they reported earlier this week, some cited some election noise. I guess, any more color you can give on the underlying trend of the U.S. market would be great."

Let me just say, for the 9 months, our growth was 4.8% in the U.S., which still is a solid performance given where -- our forecast for the full year and what the industry is saying in terms of the macro growth of our industry. And yes, you pointed out correctly that in the third quarter, we're a little bit light in the U.S. compared to the -- what we've been delivering. We've grown organically 15% in the last 2 years in the U.S. And obviously, as we grow, it gets a little more difficult. That said, the tailwinds that we refer to, we've indicated, were light in the third quarter. They're coming in, in the fourth quarter. I can't say -- again, it's a function of the fourth quarter. A lot of our revenue comes in, a lot of our operating margin comes in, in the fourth quarter. I'd like to tell you that all of that tailwind comes in at the U.S. and we're back to levels of organic growth that you've seen, but I can't say that. We do think there'll be improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But I think the health care item that Frank pointed out, we had a tough comp in the health care side, and we did have a little bit slowing down, in particular, in one of our agencies in terms of health care, and that contributed to it. But again, I'm very comfortable with the performance we have in the U.S. It continues to be a key driver for us going forward. What I like about our U.S. performance for the year is that it's across all of our agencies. We see MullenLowe, we see McCann, Mediabrands, CMG, our independent agencies. All of our agencies are strong in the U.S., and I believe we will continue to see improvement in those markets."

We said for -- on a full year basis, we've always said we'd see 1% up or 1% down. It's encouraging that we're seeing that kind of improvement. We saw a good flow-through in terms of new business at McCann as well as Mediabrands as they onboarded some new client wins that we had in those markets, particularly in Germany and Spain.

And separately, we know that Publicis has altered how it's managing markets below the top 20. I was wondering at a sort of macro industry level. If you -- and maybe for IPG specifically as well. If you think it's less necessary now than it was, say, 20 and 40 years ago to have these massive extensive global networks that have sort of dominated the largest creative agency groups. And separately, I was wondering if you could also talk about the current ebbs and flows of centralization versus decentralization in some of the agency groups. For example, it seems like there's a lot of deepening of investment in Cadreon versus putting maybe more investment in some of the individual media agency brands, not that there's not investment going there as well, but just curious to hear your thoughts on how much should live with agency brand versus more centralized entities."

Let me start. 10 years ago, we started open architecture, okay? And it was our belief that clients -- in a client-centric environment that we should be focusing on the needs of the clients, not our particular silos. And when we looked at open architecture, the issue is do we, in essence, mold all of our agencies together and say, by the way, here's our best people and irrespective of where the silo is. And obviously, there are conflict issues. There are cultural issues. There are different go-to-market strategies. And frankly, that serves us well in the marketplace. We don't believe that we need to restructure our entire company to make open architecture work. We've been doing open architecture for 10 years. And frankly, some of our most profitable and growing clients utilize an open architecture model. And the reason it works is because we've made it part of the DNA of our organization. People within the ""silos"" know that if they don't have the capabilities within their agencies, they can raise their hand, and we can bring in an expertise that will work closely with them on a collaborative basis and meet the needs of our clients. You don't need to restructure the entire company to do that. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we hold our agencies responsible for collaborative work. So when we do compensation and incentive compensation, we look at the degree of open architecture and collaboration. And on many of engagements, there are multiple agencies serving one client. And they don't have to worry about whose silo it belongs in because, frankly, we do that. We work closely with the agencies, and we determine what's the proper allocation. Clients shouldn't be involved in it. We think that's a better way of doing this because when you have one single-purpose agency doing this -- we have a number of those. But most of the time, when you have a single-purpose agency, it's harder to recruit talent, it's harder to keep talent, it's harder to get a sustainability of the quality of the people within those agencies. And open architecture is serving us very well. We get the highest grades of our reviews when we have open architecture models because the clients realize that we're putting them first. And by the way, our definition of open architecture includes third-party providers. So if our clients come to us and say, ""We'd like you to work with XYZ in addition to your resources,"" sometimes we work better with third parties, unfortunately, than our own. But that's part of the model. If you collaborated everyone and put them all into one silo, you will never get that, okay? So I think the notion of providing all the resources IPG has to a client is the correct one, which is why, frankly, we started it 10 years ago. But I don't believe you have to restructure the company to do that. You'll lose a lot of the culture. You lose a lot of the accountability, and you lose the focus that our core agencies have within those particular agencies."

We started -- the first year we came in, we got rid of 50 agencies all over the world. I've said this. We got rid of Uzbekistan.

So yes, we constantly are looking at that, ensure -- to ensure the dispositions that we've made are consistent with getting rid of nonproducing agencies that don't cost -- that are costing us money and aren't adding any value. So that's what we've been doing. On the question of Cadreon and Mediabrands and whether we're decentralizing, it doesn't make sense to invest all of that money in one particular offering and not have it available for all the other agencies. When I first came to this business, I used to walk around -- I used to travel to our different agencies, and they would all wheel out what they believed is best-in-class offerings, in particular, on the media side. And we were spending a lot of money and a lot of things that we didn't have to duplicate if everyone were able to raise their hand and work closely with the competencies in, for example, Mediabrands, whether it be UM initiative or Mediabrands as the holding company, if you will, of media. And I think that's the right way to do it. And we've done that -- a terrific job on that. For example, if you look at MullenLowe and Mediabrands and Mediahub at MullenLowe working with Mediabrands on the Western Union pitch. I mean, that was a great example of competencies within an agency as well as tapping into particular resources we have in Mediabrands. The same thing is Harley-Davidson. The same thing in all of our open architecture wins. So I think that is the most efficient way to use our expertise and the most efficient way to meet the needs of our clients. And more and more of our agencies are realizing that if they can do it that way, they get a better offering, and it's much more efficient and clients realize that they're looking out for their behalf instead of their own silo. Other than that, I don't feel strongly about it, Brian."

New clients tend to have less margin than more mature clients, and that's a fact in our business. And so what -- I'm tempering a little bit the expectation, frankly, that as we onboard all this new business that we have, it's coming in at very high margins and the margin number of expectations should be a lot higher than, frankly, as this business matures as we go through it. That said, we do have some revenue coming in, in the fourth quarter that we've already incurred a significant amount of expenses. And obviously, that revenue comes with a higher margin. So this is not an exact science. The timing of how we get our revenue and how our expenses is fluid, if you will, because we have to manage to make sure we have the right people onboarding new business, as Frank said. But we also have to realize that expectations of new clients takes a period of time for it to mature. It just doesn't happen overnight, which is why even when we started the year, everyone said, ""Well, why are you being so conservative in terms of your organic growth and margin?"" And the answer to that is staffing and onboarding new clients and macroeconomics all coming into play at one time, is a tricky thing to model, and that's why we like to look at this on a full year basis as opposed to quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So we manage it as best we can. But as -- if 50% of our margin comes, in, in the fourth quarter, we can't with a high degree of accuracy tell exactly where that's going to come."

But I wouldn't call it out as one of the major growth vehicles around the world, if you will. But it is very important to FCB, and they do a great job at it. In fact, that's one of the agencies we pull out when we have RFPs that call for shopper marketing expertise because they do it so well. The more broader question on the convergence is really how we have to look at the transformation of our industry. I do believe we are seeing new competitors entering our business, and they are bringing with them CRM expertise. They're basically system integrators. And because they're already in our clients, they view it as an opportunity to bring in CRM expertise as well as creative, which is another reason why I think when we compete against those, the fact that we have standalone agencies with strong creative talent, it's very hard for these other parties to compete against, what a McCann or an FCB or MullenLowe or our independent agencies, the firepower we can bring in on creative work. There's no way that these new competitors, if you will, can compete with that. So -- and the results show that. Even though these outliers that were coming into our business are trying to get there, I think if you look across all the holding companies, we've been pretty successful when it comes to those integrated offerings that we provide versus what they're providing. That said, we have to watch it very carefully. And clearly, they're going to be coming at it pretty strongly, so we have to be well suited. And I believe the open architecture integrated offering is a very compelling argument against them trying to get into our business."

I'll start out by covering highlights of our performance. Frank will then provide additional detail, and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies and the tone of our business, to be followed by our Q&A. 
We're pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue and profit increases. Our third quarter organic revenue growth was 4.3% on top of a very strong 7.1% in Q3 '15. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 40 basis points while FX was a negative 1.7%. As a result, total revenue growth was 3%. 
We continue to see positive momentum in the quarter from a broad range of our creative, marketing services and media offerings. Our digital capabilities also continue to be very significant drivers of growth for us. 
As you'll remember, as of some years ago, we committed to organically building digital talent and expertise within every agency across our organization so as to effectively migrate to new competencies and serve the evolving needs of marketers. Our results demonstrate that this strategy continues to pay off. 
In terms of geography, we grew organically in every world region, with the exception of Asia Pac. Our international organic growth was 8.1%, driven by Continental Europe, the U.K. and LatAm. U.S. organic growth was 1.8% for the 3 months against extremely strong comparables in the quarter for 2 consecutive years. 
Globally, we continue to see growth from nearly every client industry and were led by the tech and telecom and food and beverage sectors. 
Turning to Q3 operating expenses and margin. Operating expenses increased 2.5% compared with reported revenue growth of 3%. And as a result, operating margin expanded 50 basis points from last year's third quarter to 10.8%, reflecting leverage on our salaries and related expenses. 
For the first 9 months of the year, organic growth was 4.8%. This was very well balanced with 4.8% growth in the U.S. and 4.9% internationally. It's worth noting that the charge in pass-through services added 90 basis points to our organic growth in the quarter and added 10 basis points through 9 months. 
Operating profit year-to-date is up 9%, and operating margin in the same period expanded 40 basis points, reaching the level of 11.7% for the trailing 12-month period, which is the highest level our company has achieved in well over a decade. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year through the third quarter compared to $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. 
Turning to our update on share repurchases. During Q3, we used $81 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we've utilized approximately $193 million repurchasing 8.5 million common shares. Since instituting our return of capital programs in 2011, we've returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as well as reduced our diluted share count by 27%. At the end of the third quarter, we had $265 million remaining on our current authorization. 
Overall, our performance continues to underscore the strong competitive position of our agencies around the world and across the full spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines. The strength and growth of digital activity is also notable. We continue to manage expenses effectively in order to deliver on our margin objectives, which has been a key priority for us. As we head into our always important fourth quarter, economic and political conditions continue to present macro uncertainties. Nonetheless, the overall tone of business remains solid. 
We've also posted another good year in the new business front. And while the tailwinds from recent wins were relatively slight this past quarter due to timing, we expect the impact to be more evident in Q4. 
We have previously increased our full year 2016 organic growth target to the high end of 3% to 4% range that we shared with you coming into the year. In light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our organic growth target to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions, we have historically seen on our growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel that we remain well positioned to achieve 50 basis points or more of operating margin expansion for the full year '16. 
At this stage, I'll turn things over to Frank for the additional detail of our results and join you after his remarks for an update on our operating units to be followed by Q&A. Frank?"

On Slide 2, you'll see an overview of results, a number of which Michael has touched upon. Organic revenue growth was 4.3% in the quarter and 4.8% for the first 9 months. Q3 operating profit was $207 million with operating margin of 10.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. For the 9 months, operating margin expanded 40 basis points and operating profit grew 9%. Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.32 a share and was $0.31 adjusted for certain below-the-line items in the quarter. This compares to last year's diluted EPS of $0.27. For the 9 months, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 this year compared with $0.55 in 2015, an increase of 16%. Average fully diluted shares in Q3 decreased by 1.8% from last year due to our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slide 3 you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Here, it is worth noting that our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which compares favorably to our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 '15 of 36%. As you have seen in the past, we have volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect that our full year 2016 adjusted effective rate will be at the lower end of 37% to 39% range that we indicated earlier in the year. 
Slide 4 has more detail on our average -- on our revenue growth. Revenue was $1.92 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Compared to Q3 '15, the impact of the change in currency exchange rates was negative 1.7%. Our net acquisitions added 40 basis points to revenue. The resulting organic revenue increase was 4.3%. 
It's worth noting that net increase in pass-through revenue in the quarter mainly in our events business in the U.K. benefited organic growth by 90 basis points. For the 9 months, our change in pass-through revenue only increased organic revenue by 10 basis points. 
As you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our Integrated Agency Networks, the organic increase was 3%. This was led by strong growth at McCann, R/GA and Huge. IAN's organic growth over the first 9 months was 4.7%. 
At our CMG segment, a marketing services specialist, organic growth was 9.4%. We again had strong performance at Weber Shandwick as well as our events business, Jack Morton, and our sports marketing at Octagon. Organic growth was 5.6% at CMG, excluding the impact of higher pass-through revenues. For the 9 months, organic growth was 5.3%. 
Moving on to Slide 5, revenue by region. In the U.S., Q3 organic growth was 1.8% on top of 7.1% in Q3 '15 and 7.9% in 2014. Excluding the impact of lower pass-through revenue, organic revenue growth was 2%. It is worth noting that acquisitions in the U.S. added another 60 basis points in the quarter. Leading client sectors were food and beverage and tech and telecom as well as our other sector of diverse clients. Slower U.S. growth compared to the first half of this year was due to a less robust tailwind from the timing of account wins and to a particularly strong comp in the health care sector. 
In the U.K., organic growth was 16.4% and was 4.8% excluding the positive impact from higher pass-through revenues at our events specialist, Jack Morton. With continuing strong performance from McCann, R/GA and Octagon as well as Jack Morton, U.K. acquisitions add 3.9% to our growth in the quarter. By client sector, we were led by tech and telecom and health care. It's worth noting that our U.K. operators are not citing a specific impact on client spending related to Brexit. 
Turning to Continental Europe. Organic growth was 8.3% in the quarter, a strong result driven by new business wins in the region. We had notable increases in the retail and food and beverage sectors led by Mediabrands and McCann in Germany and Spain among our largest markets. 
In Asia Pac, our organic decrease in Q3 was 1.4%. This comes on top of 7.2% growth a year ago. In our largest regional markets, we had high single-digit growth in India, while revenues decreased in Australia and China. For the 9 months, our organic revenue decrease in the region was 80 basis points. 
In LatAm, Q3 organic growth was a strong 17.8% on top of 14.4% growth a year ago with increases in all of our largest national markets, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Growth was driven by higher spend by existing clients and by new client wins. We had notably strong performances from McCann, R/GA, Huge, Mediabrands, Octagon and FutureBrand. For the 9 months, organic growth was 15.4%. 
In our Other Markets group, organic growth continued to be strong in Q3 at 5.6%, driven by new business wins and by performance in Canada led by Mediabrands and Huge. Organic growth was 6.7% for the 9 months. 
On Slide 6, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 4.9%. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our operating expenses. In the third quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.5% from a year ago compared with our reported revenue growth of 3%. FX reduced our percentage of operating margin by 10 basis points in the quarter compared to last year but was neutral for the margin for 9 months. 
Underneath our margin improvement of 50 basis points in Q3, the ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue was 63.9% this year compared with 64.4% a year ago. The improvement was driven by year-on-year operating leverage on 2 categories: Our expense for incentives and for our category of other salaries and related expenses. This was partially offset by increased base payroll and temporary help as a percentage of revenue. 
Our total headcount at quarter end was approximately 50,400, an increase of 3.4% year-on-year. This reflects both organic hiring and acquisitions in support of our growth in areas such as digital, creative, media and PR. 
Turning to office and general expenses on the lower half of the slide. O&G expense was 25.3% of Q3 revenue compared with the same level a year ago. We leveraged our expenses for travel, supplies and telecom as well as for professional fees. That was offset by increased pass-through expenses as a percentage of revenue in our other O&G category. The net result was operating margin expansion of 50 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the first 9 months. 
Slide 8 depicts our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis. The most recent data point is 11.7%, which is an improvement of 60 basis points from a year ago. 
Slide 9 is provided for clarity on our EPS adjustment in the quarter. We had a below-the-line gain of $3.9 million in other income, primarily due to the sale of a small nonstrategic business outside the U.S. Net [ph] benefit to our diluted EPS was $0.01. As you can see, the impact of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation was de minimis in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.31. 
Moving on to Slide 10, the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $895 million in cash and short term marketable securities, which is comparable to the level last year. The comparison to December 31 reflects that our cash level is seasonal and tends to peek at year-end. 
Slide 11 is our third quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $520 million compared with $282 million a year ago. The comparison reflects increased cash generated from working capital this year, $318 million compared to $155 million a year ago. As we have pointed out previously, working capital can be volatile quarter by quarter. 
Investing activities used $65 million mainly for CapEx. Financing activities used $234 million chiefly for share repurchases and our common stock dividend as well as to decrease short-term borrowings. Our net increase in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $219 million. 
On Slide 12, we show our debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.74 billion at the most recent quarter end. 
In summary, on Slide 13, through 9 months, we have achieved 4.8% organic growth and 40 basis points of margin expansion, which represents very solid progress to our objectives for the full year. 
We are seeing growth in areas where we have focused on investment in both people and acquisitions. Our operators are focused on the appropriate cost disciplines and margin expansion, and our balance sheet is an important area that we can continue to deploy for value going forward. 
With that, let me turn it back to Michael."

Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. Ther",1544,"Thank you, Frank. Well as you can see, through the first 9 months of 2016, we reported solid results in terms of both organic revenue growth and margin progress. As I've mentioned, contributions to our positive results came from across the portfolio. There was very good balance among our agencies, geographic regions and most of all, client categories. 
Behind this strength are 2 very key strategic decisions that we took some time ago. The first was to invest in talent and foster a culture that makes us a top choice for talent in every marketing discipline and capability. Given how important compelling content is for any media, entertainment or communications company in the current environment, having the most outstanding creative strategic and digital talent has never been more vital for success, and we are well positioned in this regard. 
Another talent priority that has long been key for us is our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a driver of business performance. An environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours, and a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs when solving our clients' business challenges. We have reinforced this focus through a comprehensive set of award-winning programs, and we ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to achieve diversity objectives. While Interpublic has made a great deal of progress and we take pride in that, as an industry, we still have a ways to go in this journey. 
The second major strategic decision is our approach to digital. Unlike some of our competitors, IPG's digital capabilities have been largely grown organically and are embedded within every one of our agencies. This investment in people with new skill sets in developing new products and services and in incubating new technology has allowed us to stay highly relevant in today's digital world. 
We want to be the first place clients turn to for help and guidance as they seek to navigate the complexity of the media and marketing landscape. We know that there are some questions out there about what technology convergence will mean to our industry going forward. We may all be facing new kinds of competitors. As marcoms, IT and consulting come together. However, it's worth noting that to date, the emergence of technology-enabled marketing has created meaningful opportunity for the agency holding companies. This has definitely been the case for IPG given our skill set focused on digital, our media-agnostic view of channel allocation and a long-standing commitment to open architecture, where we've been an industry leader with this approach to delivering the best customized talent and solutions that can provide the integration of marketing functions our clients are increasingly asking for. 
What is not commonly understood is how much resource IPG already has in place across the group when it comes to data expertise, data analytics and proprietary tools that we can bring to bear in order to create accountable marketing campaigns that drive marketplace results. Data and analytics is an area we will continue to focus and invest behind so as to ensure that we can create even more targeted, dynamic and effective work on behalf of our clients. 
Moving on to operational results. It's clear that during the quarter and for the year-to-date, in addition to solid growth, we've continued to be very disciplined in terms of cost management. We remain focused on converting at the appropriate levels to deliver our margin improvement target for the year. 
We also remain committed to the kind of robust capital return programs that we've put in place in recent years, which have been driving significant shareholder value creation. 
At the agency level, McCann Worldgroup's performance in the quarter was strong. Their creative product continue to earn high levels of industry recognition, and they're growing well in a number of their major clients. Notable wins came from Reckitt Benckiser and Chick-fil-A as well as Qualcomm this past October. We're seeing a high degree of collaboration among McCann advertising, MRM, Momentum and their strong health care offerings. 
Mediabrands, once again, made significant contributions to our profitability. UM has been building out its teams to deliver for recent global wins. Leading-edge capabilities like Cadreon and Ansible are also being introduced into a range of new international markets, and we added to the reprised SEO offering with an attractive acquisition based out of the U.K. that will serve as a regional center of excellence. 
Mediabrands also recently recruited strong new leaders for EMEA and Asia Pac regions. Furthermore, in the quarter, they retained BMW North America and extended Coca-Cola in the Middle East. 
As mentioned last quarter, we have a long-standing record of transparency in our dealings with marketers and media vendors. We are proud of the role we play as wholly objective and media-agnostic advisers to our clients. 
At CMG, we saw a continued outstanding work out of Weber Shandwick. Some of you will have previously heard, it was pointed out, that is the full range of Weber's digital capabilities from strategy through analytics all the way to content creation or in a standalone company, it would be one of the largest social media agencies in the world. 
Octagon and Jack Morton were also strong performers in the quarter. 
MullenLowe continue to make headway in terms of integrating the network and promoted new leaders for its New York and London agencies, both our executives who came to the company through the acquisition of digital agency, Profero, which made important contributions to Q3 performance. MullenLowe also benefited from its bundled media offering, Mediahub, which continues to partner closely with Mediabrands as it did in the recent global win of Western Union. 
FCB is producing visible and successful new advertising work for clients, including AB InBev and a number of Chrysler brands, with work for new global client, Clorox, soon to follow. The agency further bolstered its leadership with a significant creative hire. She will lead the creative group in the flagship Chicago office. 
FCB RED, the agency shopper marketing unit, is a market leader as our operations in a number of key emerging markets, including India, Brazil and South Africa. 
As you know, we have a range of full services domestic agencies, including Deutsche, Hill Holliday and The Martin Agency and Carmichael Lynch, which can serve clients independently or partner with other IPG units in the customized integrated offerings that we refer to as open architecture. As mentioned earlier, this is a concept that we've been working to refine for some time. It has fueled many of our largest wins in recent years, including, recently, Harley-Davidson this quarter. And it's something you're now hearing more about from a number of our competitors. 
An additional highlight in the quarter was the performance of R/GA and Huge. These are among the industry's best digital networks. The strategic work they do for clients on digital transformation rivals that of any consultancy. And the range of services they provide from UX and design to strategy, digital storytelling, data visualization and more, is unrivaled in our industry. Starting from a single agency in New York, both R/GA and Huge are evolving into powerful multi-office networks. In the case of R/GA, there are now 14 locations on 4 continents. During the quarter, they posted major wins with Siemens and Mercedes-Benz. 
Huge has grown to 7 office -- U.S. offices and an equal number internationally, working with major clients, including Google, HBO and Under Armour. 
Looking forward, as mentioned in my opening remarks, the tone of the business remains solid. The new business pipeline is strong overall, and we are new business positive for year-to-date. As indicated previously, tailwinds from recent wins with will be more prevalent in Q4 than they were in Q3, which we are sharing with you today. 
Investments in talent, supplemented by a measured and strategic approach to acquisitions, should ensure that the level of professional offerings remain highly competitive. And that's vital for us to capitalize on the level of complexity and even confusion that exists in today's marketing landscape. Despite the macro uncertainty that's out there due to political and economic factors at play around the globe, we're highly focused on delivering against our top and bottom line targets for the year. 
As stated at the outset, in light of the strength of our offerings and our strong organic revenue performance through 9 months, we believe it's appropriate to raise our full year organic growth target from our previous 3% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%. 
Given the high levels of profit contributions we have historically seen in our growth in the fourth quarter, we also believe that we remain well positioned to achieve our target of expanding 2016 operating margin by 50 basis points or more. 
Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our proven commitment to capital return, which has been a source of significant value creation, this will allow us to further enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we thank you for your support. We're intent on closing out the year strongly, and we look forward to posting you on our results at our next call. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Given the tailwinds are supposed to pick up in Q4, is there an unusually difficult comp in Q4? I guess, how should we think about sort of the underlying growth rate of the U.S.? I pushed on it because a couple of your peers also highlighted weakness in the U.S. organic growth. And when they reported earlier this week, some cited some election noise.

And yes, you pointed out correctly that in the third quarter, we're a little bit light in the U.S. compared to the -- what we've been delivering. We've grown organically 15% in the last 2 years in the U.S. And obviously, as we grow, it gets a little more difficult. That said, the tailwinds that we refer to, we've indicated, were light in the third quarter. They're coming in, in the fourth quarter. I can't say -- again, it's a function of the fourth quarter. A lot of our revenue comes in, a lot of our operating margin comes in, in the fourth quarter. I'd like to tell you that all of that tailwind comes in at the U.S. and we're back to levels of organic growth that you've seen, but I can't say that. We do think there'll be improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But I think the health care item that Frank pointed out, we had a tough comp in the health care side, and we did have a little bit slowing down, in particular, in one of our agencies in terms of health care, and that contributed to it. But again, I'm very comfortable with the performance we have in the U.S. It continues to be a key driver for us going forward. What I like about our U.S. performance for the year is that it's across all of our agencies. We see MullenLowe, we see McCann, Mediabrands, CMG, our independent agencies. All of our agencies are strong in the U.S., and I believe we will continue to see improvement in those markets."

And we -- new wins and client spend in that particular region has a nice effect, which is what you're seeing in this quarter with the results for Continental Europe. We said for -- on a full year basis, we've always said we'd see 1% up or 1% down. It's encouraging that we're seeing that kind of improvement. We saw a good flow-through in terms of new business at McCann as well as Mediabrands as they onboarded some new client wins that we had in those markets, particularly in Germany and Spain.

Actually, that's real growth, which is what -- you were kind in your question. It -- we did onboard some new clients in Latin America in terms of LatAm Airways (sic) [LATAM Airlines] and Bradesco, and we see some client spend increasing there. So that's what you're seeing the reason for our growth in Brazil. So it's client-specific. It's onboarding. And frankly, what I like about it it's across the regions in Latin America. It's not all Brazil. We're seeing strength in other market. We're seeing our digital offerings do very well in South America. R/GA and Huge are doing very well down there because the digital environment is ripe for growth. And frankly, we use those markets for production facilities given the talent base that we have in Latin America and the effectiveness that we've been able to utilize that talent on a worldwide basis. R/GA, in particular, as well as Huge use that as a base to service global clients, if you will, in the connected world, as I'll quote Bob Greenberg.

We historically -- we've done strategic acquisitions. We see most of our growth coming organically. For example, in Cadreon, we've seen -- we've expanded it internationally. We've coordinated their offerings among all resources and agencies within U.S., and we will continue to do that. So I think the bulk of the growth will come organically. However, we are looking at strategic acquisitions in that space. We also are looking at a more coordinated basis in terms of our database, if you will, in terms of a DMP. And that will be a key focus for us in 2017, to make sure that all the agencies within IPG have a consistent offering and utilizing the unique capabilities we have at Mediabrands. That's -- I see that as an important growth vehicle for us. Clients are looking for it. That's the area where we're seeing a lot of competitors, if you will, trying to get -- have inroads in our clients. So that's when [ph] I talk about investment in data and analytics, and we're going to be stepping up our efforts in those parts. And frankly, if we don't have it organically and we don't have those capabilities internally, we will look to add on. So look, with Mediabrands, we added 2 very nice agencies this past year, one in the SEO space and one in the mobile space. Those are growth vehicles for us. Mobile, clearly, is going to be a key driver for business going forward. Our Ansible offering, we consolidated a number of businesses with the new acquisitions to make sure that we have full integrated mobile offering across our various brands. So this is the value of a holding company across all of our networks, and we continue to focus on Mediabrands as a key source of providing those unique competencies utilizing these kind of data."

Let me start. 10 years ago, we started open architecture, okay? And it was our belief that clients -- in a client-centric environment that we should be focusing on the needs of the clients, not our particular silos. And when we looked at open architecture, the issue is do we, in essence, mold all of our agencies together and say, by the way, here's our best people and irrespective of where the silo is. And obviously, there are conflict issues. There are cultural issues. There are different go-to-market strategies. And frankly, that serves us well in the marketplace. We don't believe that we need to restructure our entire company to make open architecture work. We've been doing open architecture for 10 years. And frankly, some of our most profitable and growing clients utilize an open architecture model. And the reason it works is because we've made it part of the DNA of our organization. People within the ""silos"" know that if they don't have the capabilities within their agencies, they can raise their hand, and we can bring in an expertise that will work closely with them on a collaborative basis and meet the needs of our clients. You don't need to restructure the entire company to do that. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we hold our agencies responsible for collaborative work. So when we do compensation and incentive compensation, we look at the degree of open architecture and collaboration. And on many of engagements, there are multiple agencies serving one client. And they don't have to worry about whose silo it belongs in because, frankly, we do that. We work closely with the agencies, and we determine what's the proper allocation. Clients shouldn't be involved in it. We think that's a better way of doing this because when you have one single-purpose agency doing this -- we have a number of those. But most of the time, when you have a single-purpose agency, it's harder to recruit talent, it's harder to keep talent, it's harder to get a sustainability of the quality of the people within those agencies. And open architecture is serving us very well. We get the highest grades of our reviews when we have open architecture models because the clients realize that we're putting them first. And by the way, our definition of open architecture includes third-party providers. So if our clients come to us and say, ""We'd like you to work with XYZ in addition to your resources,"" sometimes we work better with third parties, unfortunately, than our own. But that's part of the model. If you collaborated everyone and put them all into one silo, you will never get that, okay? So I think the notion of providing all the resources IPG has to a client is the correct one, which is why, frankly, we started it 10 years ago. But I don't believe you have to restructure the company to do that. You'll lose a lot of the culture. You lose a lot of the accountability, and you lose the focus that our core agencies have within those particular agencies."

We started -- the first year we came in, we got rid of 50 agencies all over the world. I've said this. We got rid of Uzbekistan.

So yes, we constantly are looking at that, ensure -- to ensure the dispositions that we've made are consistent with getting rid of nonproducing agencies that don't cost -- that are costing us money and aren't adding any value. So that's what we've been doing. On the question of Cadreon and Mediabrands and whether we're decentralizing, it doesn't make sense to invest all of that money in one particular offering and not have it available for all the other agencies. When I first came to this business, I used to walk around -- I used to travel to our different agencies, and they would all wheel out what they believed is best-in-class offerings, in particular, on the media side. And we were spending a lot of money and a lot of things that we didn't have to duplicate if everyone were able to raise their hand and work closely with the competencies in, for example, Mediabrands, whether it be UM initiative or Mediabrands as the holding company, if you will, of media. And I think that's the right way to do it. And we've done that -- a terrific job on that. For example, if you look at MullenLowe and Mediabrands and Mediahub at MullenLowe working with Mediabrands on the Western Union pitch. I mean, that was a great example of competencies within an agency as well as tapping into particular resources we have in Mediabrands. The same thing is Harley-Davidson. The same thing in all of our open architecture wins. So I think that is the most efficient way to use our expertise and the most efficient way to meet the needs of our clients. And more and more of our agencies are realizing that if they can do it that way, they get a better offering, and it's much more efficient and clients realize that they're looking out for their behalf instead of their own silo. Other than that, I don't feel strongly about it, Brian."

New clients tend to have less margin than more mature clients, and that's a fact in our business. And so what -- I'm tempering a little bit the expectation, frankly, that as we onboard all this new business that we have, it's coming in at very high margins and the margin number of expectations should be a lot higher than, frankly, as this business matures as we go through it. That said, we do have some revenue coming in, in the fourth quarter that we've already incurred a significant amount of expenses. And obviously, that revenue comes with a higher margin. So this is not an exact science. The timing of how we get our revenue and how our expenses is fluid, if you will, because we have to manage to make sure we have the right people onboarding new business, as Frank said. But we also have to realize that expectations of new clients takes a period of time for it to mature. It just doesn't happen overnight, which is why even when we started the year, everyone said, ""Well, why are you being so conservative in terms of your organic growth and margin?"" And the answer to that is staffing and onboarding new clients and macroeconomics all coming into play at one time, is a tricky thing to model, and that's why we like to look at this on a full year basis as opposed to quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So we manage it as best we can. But as -- if 50% of our margin comes, in, in the fourth quarter, we can't with a high degree of accuracy tell exactly where that's going to come."

But I wouldn't call it out as one of the major growth vehicles around the world, if you will. But it is very important to FCB, and they do a great job at it. In fact, that's one of the agencies we pull out when we have RFPs that call for shopper marketing expertise because they do it so well. The more broader question on the convergence is really how we have to look at the transformation of our industry. I do believe we are seeing new competitors entering our business, and they are bringing with them CRM expertise. They're basically system integrators. And because they're already in our clients, they view it as an opportunity to bring in CRM expertise as well as creative, which is another reason why I think when we compete against those, the fact that we have standalone agencies with strong creative talent, it's very hard for these other parties to compete against, what a McCann or an FCB or MullenLowe or our independent agencies, the firepower we can bring in on creative work. There's no way that these new competitors, if you will, can compete with that. So -- and the results show that. Even though these outliers that were coming into our business are trying to get there, I think if you look across all the holding companies, we've been pretty successful when it comes to those integrated offerings that we provide versus what they're providing. That said, we have to watch it very carefully. And clearly, they're going to be coming at it pretty strongly, so we have to be well suited. And I believe the open architecture integrated offering is a very compelling argument against them trying to get into our business."
