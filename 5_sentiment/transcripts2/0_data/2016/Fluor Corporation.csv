But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. 
During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed earlier today. 
During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.fluor.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016. Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full-year results, I do want",966,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016. Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full-year results, I do want to spend a few minutes to share my perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth continues to be weak and commodity prices remain low. We expect economic growth for the year to be similar of the past few years, yet we also expect commodity prices to stabilize during this year and perhaps even begin to improve in the last part of the year. The lower commodity prices obviously, continue to impact our customers cash flows and therefore, their ability to fund certain projects at the same pace that they've done previously. 
Many of our customers have already announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2016. However, Fluor serves a diverse portfolio of industries and regions. This provides the company opportunities even in difficult market environments. While low oil prices may delay some oil and gas projects, Fluor is focused on our clients and their spending priorities. 
As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to see the FID on large greenfield LNG facilities to move to the right as clients focus on opportunities to improve capital efficiency. By that extension, it's important to note that we do not anticipate any material contributions from LNG projects during 2016. Our Power business should experience strong growth this year with the Westinghouse projects now fully transitioned plus the business is experiencing an uptick in gas-related projects. 
Our government and infrastructure markets are also experiencing growth with key recent wins, including the $1.4 billion nuclear cleanup project in Idaho and the Arizona Loop 202 [ph] project. We also expect to hear shortly the outcome of our bid to build the 16-mile purple line light rail project in Maryland. We continue to implement our integrated solution strategy. Our strategy focuses on delivering the full spectrum of capital efficient solutions for our customers. 
We've taken significant steps in 2015 to broaden our offering, including expanding our global fabrication footprint with the announcement of the joint venture in China and extending our position in the construction and maintenance markets through the Westinghouse Nuclear Awards and our upcoming acquisition store. While we're talking about fabrication investments and historic acquisition, let me give you an update on the closings status. Our JV with and the Zhuhai fabrication continues to progress. We're receiving final approvals now and expect to make our first payment in the next few months. 
Back in December, we announced the intent to acquire a new store, a maintenance and modification and asset integrity company based in The Netherlands. Stork enhances not only our current offering, but creates tremendous opportunity to leverage our combined capabilities and brands across a broad spectrum of opportunities. We anticipate this transactions to also close in the next few months. 
While we expect 2016 to be another challenging year, our focus will be on the things that we can control. Now let's look at our 2015 full year results beginning with Slide 5 -- Slide 3. Excluding a pretax nonoperating pension settlement expense of $240 million, net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $571 million or $3.89 per diluted share compared with $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for 2015 was $1 billion, which compares to $1.3 billion a year ago. Despite volatile oil prices, our Oil & Gas segment performed very well during the year contributing $764 million in segment profit, a 14% increase over 2014. However, this increase was offset by the decline in other segments. Segment profits -- profit margins were 5.7%, which compares with 5.9% a year ago. 
Consolidated 2015 revenue was $18.1 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago. Full-year new awards were $21.8 billion [ph], including $11 billion in Oil & Gas, $6 billion in Power, $3.2 billion in Industrial Infrastructure and $1.4 billion in Government. Consolidated backlog for the year ended -- ending was $44.7 billion, up 5% from $42.5 billion a year ago. Our clients have not given any indication that they intend to cancel any ongoing projects with us. 
Turning to Slide 4. The Oil & Gas segment with $2.1 billion in new awards, including 2 Pemex refining projects in Mexico. Ending backlog for that segment was $28.8 billion, which compares to $28.5 billion in 2014. Fourth quarter new awards in industrial infrastructure were $302 million. We closed the year with a backlog of $5.6 billion compared to $7.2 billion at the end of 2014, which reflects the reduced Mining & Metals new award activity. 
The Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $352 million and they're ending backlog in 2015 was $3.6 billion. Turning to Slide 5 in the Power segment. Fourth quarter new awards were $5.1 billion, including award for 2 reimbursable contracts with Westinghouse Electric Co. to manage the construction workforce at 2 nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina. Ending backlog for 2015 was $6.8 billion, which compares to $2.1 billion a year ago. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a $31 million charge related to a gas Fluor power facility in Brunswick County Virginia. This is primarily related to commissioning, taking longer than expected due to changes and challenges associated with the installation of the gas turbines, which extended past the third quarter. This project has reached mechanical completion and we anticipate turning this project over to the customer in spring. 
With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the core financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $5.5 billion a year ago. All segments reported slight year-over-year reductions with the exception of industrial infrastructure, which experienced a 41% decline mainly due to the continued reduction in mining activity. Excluding the pension settlement expense of $231 million, or $1.04 per diluted share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.68 compared to $1.41 a year ago. 
Including pension settlement expenses, the company reported a loss of $51 million or $0.36 per diluted share. This quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.21 per share due to the combined effect of the $31 million charge on the Brunswick Power project and the higher-than-expected tax rate due to losses in 2 foreign subsidiaries that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. These tax effects converse in the future. 
Over the course of the year, we received a few questions about the impact of foreign exchange rates on the P&L. Looking at the impact of FX on a quarterly basis, there is very little variation. However, when you look at FX from a yearly impact, 2015 versus 2014, using average rates of both periods, there is a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.20. Corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $53 million a year ago. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial position remains very strong with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, flat with a year ago. In 2015, the company generated $849 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $643 million in 2014. The company also returned $635 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the first quarter 2015 as you recall, we also settled a claim for dispute operations of $306 million. Absent that, cash flow from operations would be even stronger. The previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 till the end of 2015. For the year, we repurchased 10,105,000 shares. On February 4, 2016, the Board of Directors increased our outstanding share repurchase reauthorization by 10 million shares. However, although our cash position is strong at year-end, everyone should keep in mind that we have existing near-term commitments for our cash. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $44.7 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 22% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 41% U.S. and 59% non-U.S. For the year, backlog was negatively impacted by about $3 billion as a result of the strong dollar. 
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. We are maintaining our guidance for 2016 at $3.50 to $4 per share. Our guidance for 2016 also assumed G&A expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million and a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale expenses of approximately $90 million as we get to DC Apus submittal ledger this year, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million and our payments to fund our joint venture with COOEC of $350 million in the first half and $140 million in the third quarter of this year. Our guidance does not include any benefit related to our acquisition of Stork nor any transaction and integration-related costs. This transaction is expected to close as early as March. Our guidance reflects that expectation of gradual quarterly improvement in 2016. 
With that operator, we're ready to take questions."

We still have a -- I mean, it is a robust plan that's synonymous with the former year in terms of things we're looking at. So I feel good about the total number. But it's just going to be a little bit of a dance here at the end of the quarter based on what decisions our customers make.

But I guess my concern is or what I'm trying to understand is, how do I think about the run rate of oil and gas profits as we exit the year? Because my concern I guess, is more as we think about '17, if awards don't materialize this year in oil and gas, which I don't think they do, how do we think about how materially down earnings can be in 2017 because I can't think of a good reason why, outside of what we know about Westinghouse and Stork, why the other businesses could actually sort of make up for the decline that we're going to see in oil and gas?"

But our diversity does provide -- those puts and takes you mentioned. Yes, there have been puts and takes that keeps us at guidance where we are, which is a value of the diversity that we enjoy. If we were just an oil and gas company, you'd probably have seen us reduce things like a lot of other folks have over the last few quarters. But that diversity pays off. The ability to take on big projects in Power helps our earnings stream. Our ability to do operations and some maintenance work. Our ability to work in the pharmaceutical business and the infrastructure sector, all helps us from a diversity standpoint maintain our earnings power. So I think that we got the opportunity to perform as we suggested at the end of the third quarter. Relative to oil and gas, right now as we see it, the year will be reasonably strong. And as we enter '17, assuming that a couple of things happen that we anticipate, '17 should be equally as strong in terms of oil and gas. So I guess, there's a bit of a bearish tone in terms of the overall and most of that bearish tone is coming from the press. I'm fairly bullish about our ability to deliver on '16. I'm pretty bullish about our position in the marketplace and backlog as at least stay flat with backlog as we enter '17.

We're seeing an uptick in opportunity in the infrastructure group. They kind of hit a low as you ended '14 and early '15. And we're seeing a significant slate of opportunities a bit are there. And part of that is I think the U.S. government focus on infrastructure and the things that are necessary to keep the U.S. economy going. So that's a bright spot. We're seeing an uptick in terms of pharmaceutical biotech opportunities with the FDA, approving drugs. Some of those projects are getting off of a -- off to mark. We're seeing a significant amount of front end work, steady work on gas-fired power plants and we see a pretty robust opportunities slate there. When you look at oil and gas though, you got to peel the onion and peel it this way: Number one, there is no drilling going on. The rig -- you can read the rig counts just like anybody else. We don't have any exposure to that. You can look at the big deepwater drilling, the horizontal drilling and some difficult places obviously, lesson learned. We don't do that either. We are seeing however, a fair amount of work in traditional offshore and traditional onshore upstream oil and gas and significant FEED work in those areas because they're -- the oil companies are kind of taking their deep breath and they're looking at, okay, what are the priorities? And I know those priorities are coming out as studies and FEEDs in those markets. And those are slow, but they're calming. I think the FEED activity that's picked up as I said earlier has been in refining and it continues to be in petrochemicals and fine chemicals. So you got to kind of peel the onion and the things that we have exposure to, we're seeing a pretty robust slate of front end work that again, gives us kind of flexibility going back to Jamie's question about '17. We've got good visibility into the priority of the projects that our customers are taking, the economic viability of those projects based on current economic factors and that's what leads us to say that we'll have a pretty robust reward slate that -- and robust to me means equal to this year and certainly, provides some visibility into the opportunities for '17. So again, I go back to what I said during Jamie's question, the glass is half-full and it's half-full for us because of the fact that we've really stepped to our customers and we've answered their call for integrated solutions and capital efficiencies."

I was in an event this morning at the Dallas bid, and the same kind of discussion was taking place. It's interesting. I remember it and I've said it on these calls before and in private meetings with you guys, I was sent to Saudi Arabia in 1997 and oil was $17 a barrel, up from $11. This isn't the first time me or people within our industry or our company, have seen this kind of swings and volatility in markets. And they will fix themselves. I mean, when you think right now, there's an oversupply of oil products. There's an oversupply of gas. There's an oversupply of LNG. It's going to take a while for that to clear, but it will clear. And when you think about particularly oil and gas customers, they haven't said they're going to stop spending. They said they're going to cut their capital spending. And that just means that they're going to prioritize and look at those high valued projects, which is one of the litmus tests or selectivity says that we use in terms of what projects we actually pursue. So again, I think our strategy is sound in terms of how we want to face the market and how we want to deal with the customers and which projects do we want to prioritize on. But that does not mean that we're not going to continue to look at our strategy, focus on cash management, focus on lower -- continuing to find areas of how we do our projects to lower cost to meet that demand that the customers asking for in terms of capital efficiency. So we're going to continue to work. And as I said in the prepared remarks, focus on the things that we can control. And right now, that's how we focus on the customers and how we sell a different way of doing projects that delivers what they're asking for."

If you look at how we talked about margins over the last couple of months going back to the third quarter call and then presentations since then, if you aggregate that all together, you're probably on a consolidated basis, somewhere in the plus 4% range. But where exactly that lands is just a tough call. There's just too many variables. So we feel good about the extent that our revenues are covered significantly by what's in the backlog.

So it has really come down, our mining activity came down year-over-year as a result of Afghanistan. But most of that was really reflected as lower levels of equipment back to the end of 2014. So we'll see. But we think that's certainly there's prospects for that business to pick up as we support our own -- start our own projects and construction in 2016. In terms of capital deployment, as I said, initially we've got -- we have a healthy cash balance. We're really happy with how we generated cash last year and expect to do a really great job in generating cash this year. But we have some expenditures right in front of us in terms of the funding of the China fabrication joint venture. As I said in my comments, there's $500 million over the course of the year, just under $500 million that has to be funded. So over the very near term, I think that we have places, that we figure generate great returns over time to go invest in. Beyond that, our strategy remains the same as it has in the past, typically. We don't expect to preannounce any kind of a share repurchase program. What we expect to do is as we go through time, evaluate our excess capital as it's generated. What to see first if there's some high investment opportunity that will create a good return for shareholders. High investment return opportunity create the return for shareholders. And then if in the absence of that, we'll look to see if the repurchase shares just like we have in the past. But it's not a near-term analysis we had to go through. Because as I said, we've got some near-term opportunities for our cash. Commitments already made. We'll generate good cash flow in the future if we have that expectation, so we look forward to having to do that analysis going forward."

But I've seen the turn on a dime in terms of what they want to do and I don't really want to call it a herd mentality. But they got these things pent up on their drawing board, they want to get them going and they can move them pretty rapidly. As I said, I don't think you're going to see the supply situation change dramatically until as we get into the mid part of the year. But once that glut kind of clears, I think you'll see commodity prices kind of stabilize if not rise as we get to the back end. But the other thing that I'd warn everybody about is when you think about the long-term nature of oil and gas developments, from exploratory well to production is a decade. So they're not thinking about spending today or tomorrow, they're thinking about spending today so that either their reserve base or their product mix or whatever is focused on that further longer view. And they're going to continue to fund those projects that satisfy that need. So 2 ways of answering your question. One, they can turn quick, I don't anticipate it in '16.

So we still see that as pretty tough market. But again, either the way we're -- the way we're doing work applies to Power just like it applies to some of the other businesses. So we're kind of changing the game a little bit and I think we've got a competitive offering. Infrastructure is a little bit the same way, but we're starting to see some of these things come to fruition and we're winning. And we're winning in things that we already know how to do, roads and light rail, and we're winning with acceptable margins with our partner. So I feel reasonably okay there. The other businesses are doing quite fine. We talked a lot about oil and gas, our ability and the quality of the margin and the backlog that I spoke off, I think is testament to changing the model of how we deliver, which makes us more competitive in the marketplace. Our Government business has done quite well. We haven't talked about that when we went to Idaho and I really, really huge wind -- win for us and something we're really pleased with, which again, if you think about it, that adds and with the Stork acquisition, it adds to that non-commodity piece of our business, which should surprise -- provide some stability in earnings over the longer term. Those are big long 3 to 5-year kind of contracts. So again, going back to part of my comment to Jamie, that also gives us confidence in our ability to end '16 and start '17 with a pretty robust capability in terms of earnings potential. So this is hard business and it's always competitive. It's never easy in terms of what our competition confronts us with or what our client expectations are. And I'm just really proud of our organization to how we respond to that and how we've responded as an organization to a new way of doing business, the results and better margin performance across the board."

We feel good about the fact that our first customer has gotten an agreement with the DOE for a site for the first one in Idaho, and just the fact that we won the Idaho project, I think strengthens our ability to deliver on that. So we're on target. We feel good about what we're going to submit. We feel good about the NRC's readiness to do that review. And we think that opens the door for future investment in NuScale from outside of Fluor."

And when you look at those demand growth, we're still looking at a million barrels a day kind of growth in the midterm, I would say. So when you think about some of the production that's going to naturally come off due to depletion curves, you look at -- I guess, the Saudi's and the Russians kind of put up for a lack of a better term, a ceiling on production. You can see where that glut's going to clear pretty quickly. I think what's different this time is in a lot of these producing countries, their cost base has gone up because of the social programs. So I think they're going to do what they can to turn this more quickly than maybe would have taken place when you -- even if you go back into the '70s and what the embargo did. So I'm not sure you can actually do a comparison to the '90s. Not sure you can do a comparison to the '70s or even if you go back into the early 2000's when pricing went down. I just think it's a different marker. And I'll give you an example. This is the first time in my career where when the sabers rattle between anybody in the Middle East that threatens the straights of our, and I'm speaking specifically between the Saudi's and the Iranians which obviously, was in the press. The oil price didn't spike by $10 a barrel the next day, and in fact, this time, it went down. So I would argue that the fundamentals are significantly different today in terms of who's producing and how much they're producing, and the change and the flow of those products over the last decade. More gas, more LNG, LNG glut right now. Oil is there, coal is bad. I mean, I just think that there's a lot of issues that are different in this cycle than they were in the past. But I think the one thing that's going to drive may be a quicker recovery than some of the historical times is the need for a cost per barrel to satisfy the social need to some of these producers."

I remember back in the day, when they used to plan on '14. It was the kind of the litmus test for capital spend. So it'll morph and change, but I think there's a huge wake-up call that $100 isn't something that's there forever. But I also remember everybody saying the sky would fall and the world would end if it ever went above $100. That didn't happen either.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016.

On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016. Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full year results, I do want to spend a few minutes to share my perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth continues to be weak and commodity prices remain low. We expect economic growth for the year to be similar of the past few years, yet we also expect commodity prices to stabilize during this year and perhaps even begin to improve in the last part of the year. The lower commodity prices obviously, continue to impact our customers' cash flows and therefore, their ability to fund certain projects at the same pace that they've done previously. 
Many of our customers have already announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2016. However, Fluor serves a diverse portfolio of industries and regions. This provides the company opportunities even in difficult market environments. While low oil prices may delay some Oil & Gas projects, Fluor is focused on our clients and their spending priorities. 
As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to see the FID on large greenfield LNG facilities to move to the right as clients focus on opportunities to improve capital efficiency. By that extension, it's important to note that we do not anticipate any material contributions from LNG projects during 2016. Our Power business should experience strong growth this year with the Westinghouse projects now fully transitioned plus the business has experienced an uptick in gas-related projects. 
Our government and infrastructure markets are also experiencing growth with key recent wins, including the $1.4 billion nuclear cleanup project in Idaho and the Arizona Loop 202 project. We also expect to hear shortly the outcome of our bid to build the 16-mile Purple Line light rail project in Maryland. We continue to implement our integrated solution strategy. Our strategy focuses on delivering the full spectrum of capital efficient solutions for our customers. 
We've taken significant steps in 2015 to broaden our offering, including expanding our global fabrication footprint with the announcement of the COOEC joint venture in China and extending our position in the construction and maintenance markets through the Westinghouse Nuclear Awards and our upcoming acquisition Stork. While we're talking about fabrication investments and historic acquisition, let me give you an update on the closing status. Our JV with COOEC and the Zhuhai fabrication yard continues to progress. We're receiving final approvals now and expect to make our first payment in the next few months. 
Back in December, we announced the intent to acquire Stork, a maintenance and modification and asset integrity company based in The Netherlands. Stork enhances not only our current offering, but creates tremendous opportunity to leverage our combined capabilities and brands across a broad spectrum of opportunities. We anticipate this transaction to also close in the next few months. 
While we expect 2016 to be another challenging year, our focus will be on the things that we can control. Now let's look at our 2015 full year results beginning with Slide 5 -- Slide 3. Excluding a pretax nonoperating pension settlement expense of $240 million, net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $571 million or $3.89 per diluted share compared with $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for 2015 was $1 billion, which compares to $1.3 billion a year ago. Despite volatile oil prices, our Oil & Gas segment performed very well during the year, contributing $764 million in segment profit, a 14% increase over 2014. However, this increase was offset by the decline in other segments. Segment profits -- profit margins were 5.7%, which compares with 5.9% a year ago. 
Consolidated 2015 revenue was $18.1 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago. Full year new awards were $21.8 billion, including $11 billion in Oil & Gas, $6 billion in Power, $3.2 billion in Industrial and Infrastructure and $1.4 billion in Government. Consolidated backlog for the year ended -- ending was $44.7 billion, up 5% from $42.5 billion a year ago. Our clients have not given any indication that they intend to cancel any ongoing projects with us. 
Turning to Slide 4. The Oil & Gas segment got $2.1 billion in new awards, including 2 Pemex refining projects in Mexico. Ending backlog for that segment was $28.8 billion, which compares to $28.5 billion in 2014. Fourth quarter new awards in industrial and infrastructure were $302 million. We closed the year with a backlog of $5.6 billion compared to $7.2 billion at the end of 2014, which reflects the reduced Mining & Metals new award activity. 
The Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $352 million, and they're ending backlog in 2015 was $3.6 billion. Turning to Slide 5 in the Power segment. Fourth quarter new awards of $5.1 billion, including award for 2 reimbursable contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at 2 nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina. Ending backlog for 2015 was $6.8 billion, which compares to $2.1 billion a year ago. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a $31 million charge related to a gas Fluor Power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia. This was primarily related to commissioning, taking longer than expected due to changes and challenges associated with the installation of the gas turbines that extended past the third quarter. This project has reached mechanical completion, and we anticipate turning this project over to the customer in the spring. 
With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $5.5 billion a year ago. All segments reported slight year-over-year reductions, with the exception of industrial infrastructure, which experienced a 41% decline mainly due to the continued reduction in mining activity. Excluding the pension settlement expense of $231 million, or $1.04 per diluted share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.68 compared to $1.41 a year ago. 
Including pension settlement expenses, the company reported a loss of $51 million or $0.36 per diluted share. This quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.21 per share due to the combined effect of the $31 million charge on the Brunswick Power project and the higher-than-expected tax rate due to losses in 2 foreign subsidiaries that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. These tax effects converse in the future. 
Over the course of the year, we received a few questions about the impact of foreign exchange rates on the P&L. Looking at the impact of FX on a quarterly basis, there is very little variation. However, when you look at FX from a yearly impact, 2015 versus 2014, using average rates of both periods, there is a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.20. Corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $53 million a year ago. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial position remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, flat with a year ago. In 2015 the company generated $849 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $643 million in 2014. The company also returned $635 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the first quarter 2015 as you recall, we also settled a claim for dispute operations of $306 million. Absent that, cash flow from operations would be even stronger. The previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 through the end of 2015. For the year, we repurchased 10,105,000 shares. On February 4, 2016, the Board of Directors increased our outstanding share repurchase reauthorization by 10 million shares. However, although our cash position is strong at year-end, everyone should keep in mind that we have existing near-term commitments for our cash. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $44.7 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 22% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 41% U.S. and 59% non-U.S. For the year, backlog was negatively impacted by about $3 billion as a result of the strong dollar. 
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. We are maintaining our guidance for 2016 at $3.50 to $4 per share. Our guidance for 2016 also assumed G&A expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million and a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale expenses of approximately $90 million as we get to DCA submittal later this year, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million and our payments to fund our joint venture with COOEC of $350 million in the first half and $140 million in the third quarter of this year. Our guidance does not include any benefit related to our acquisition of Stork nor any transaction and integration-related cost. This transaction is expected to close as early as March.

And then David, I guess my other question to you is, Andy is trying to ask about Oil & Gas revenue and operating profit for 2016 or margins. But I guess, my concern is -- or what I'm trying to understand is, how do I think about the run rate of Oil & Gas profits as we exit the year? Because my concern I guess, is more as we think about '17, if awards don't materialize this year in Oil & Gas, which I don't think they do, how do I think about how materially down earnings can be in 2017 because I can't think of a good reason why -- outside of what we know about Westinghouse and Stork, why the other businesses could actually sort of make up for the decline that we're going to see in Oil & Gas?"

But our diversity does provide those puts and takes that you mentioned. And yes, there have been puts and takes that keeps us at the guidance where we are, which is a value of the diversity that we enjoy. If we were just an Oil & Gas company, you'd probably seen us reduce things like a lot of other folks have over the last few quarters. But that diversity pays off. The ability to take on big projects in Power helps our earnings stream. Our ability to do operations and maintenance work. Our ability to work in the pharmaceutical business and the infrastructure sector, all helps us from a diversity standpoint maintain our earnings power. So I think that we got the opportunity to perform as we suggested at the end of the third quarter. Relative to Oil & Gas, right now as we see it, the year will be reasonably strong. And as we enter '17, assuming that a couple of things happen that we anticipate, '17 should be equally as strong in terms of Oil & Gas. So I guess, there's a bit of a bearish tone in terms of the overall, and most of that bearish tone is coming from the press. I'm fairly bullish about our ability to deliver on '16. I'm pretty bullish about our position in the marketplace to add backlog as at least, stay flat with backlog as we enter '17.

We're seeing an uptick in opportunity in the infrastructure group. They kind of hit a low as you ended '14 and early '15. And we're seeing a significant slate of opportunities that are there. And part of that is I think the U.S. government focus on infrastructure and the things that are necessary to keep the U.S. economy going. So that's a bright spot. We're seeing an uptick in terms of pharmaceutical and biotech opportunities with the FDA approving drugs. Some of those projects are getting off of a -- off the mark. We're seeing a significant amount of front-end work, steady work on gas-fired power plants, and we see a pretty robust opportunity slate there. When you look at Oil & Gas though, you got to peel the onion and peel it this way: Number one, there is no drilling going on. The rig -- you can read the rig counts just like anybody else. We don't have any exposure to that. You can look at the big deepwater drilling, the horizontal drilling in some difficult places obviously, that is slowing. We don't do that either. We are seeing however, a fair amount of work in traditional offshore and traditional onshore upstream Oil & Gas and significant FEED work in those areas because they're -- the oil companies have kind of taken their deep breath and they're looking at, okay, what are the priorities? And now those priorities are coming out as studies and FEEDs in those markets. And those are slow, but they're coming. I think the FEED activity that's picked up as I said earlier has been in refining and it continues to be in petrochemicals and fine chemicals. So you kind of got to peel the onion and the things that we have exposure to, we're still seeing a pretty robust slate of front-end work that again, gives us kind of visibility going back to Jamie's question about '17. We've got good visibility into the priority of the projects that our customers were taking, the economic viability of those projects based on current economic factors and that's what leads us to say that we'll have a pretty robust award slate that -- and robust to me means equal to this year and certainly, provides some visibility into the opportunities for '17. So again, I go back to what I said during Jamie's question, the glass is half full. And it's half full for us because of the fact that we've really stuck to our customers, and we've answered their call for integrated solutions and capital efficiencies."

This isn't the first time me or people within our industry or our company, have seen these kind of swings and volatility in markets. And they will fix themselves. I mean, when you think right now, there's an oversupply of oil products. There's an oversupply of gas. There's an oversupply of LNG. It's going to take a while for that to clear, but it will clear. And when you think about particularly, the Oil & Gas customers, they haven't said they're going to stop spending. They said they're going to cut their capital spending. And that just means that they're going to prioritize and look at those high-valued projects, which is one of the litmus tests or selectivity says that we use in terms of what projects we actually pursue.

So it has really come down, as a result of lower mining activity it came down year-over-year as a result of Afghanistan. But most of that was really reflected as lower levels of equipment back to the end of 2014. So we'll see. But we think that certainly there's prospects for that business to pick up as we support our own -- start our own projects in construction, in 2016. In terms of capital deployment, as I said, initially we've got -- we have a healthy cash balance. We're really happy with how we generated cash last year and expect to do a great job at generating cash again this year. But we have some expenditures right in front of us in terms of the funding of the China fabrication joint venture. As I said in my comments, there is $500 million over the course of the year. Just under $500 million that has to be funded. So over the very near term, I think we have places that we figure generate great returns over time to go invest in. Beyond that, our strategy remains the same as it has in the past, typically. We don't expect to preannounce any kind of a share repurchase program. What we expect to do is as we go through time, evaluate our excess capital as it's generated. What to see first if there's some high investment opportunity that will create a good return for shareholders. High investment return opportunity that'll create a great return for shareholders. And then if -- in the absence of that, we'll look to see if the repurchase shares just like we have in the past.

So there's still pretty robust slate of projects, but they're -- but mostly refining and petrochemical programs, just like you're seeing here in the States. So I think there's near-term opportunities. My experience out there suggests that it depends on how much of a return of the oil price happens and when. But I've seen them turn on a dime in terms of what they want to do. And I don't really want to call it a herd mentality. But they got these things pent up on their drawing board, they want to get them going and they can move pretty rapidly. As I said, I don't think you're going to see the supply situation change dramatically until -- as we get into mid part of the year. But once that glut kind of clears, I think you'll see commodity prices kind of stabilize, if not rise, as we get to the back end. But the other thing that I'd warn everybody about is when you think about the long-term nature of oil and gas developments, from exploratory well to production is a decade. So they're not thinking about spending today or tomorrow, they're thinking about spending today so that either their reserve base or their product mix or whatever is focused on that further longer view. And they're going to continue to fund those projects that satisfy that need. So 2 ways of answering your question. One, they can turn quick. I don't anticipate it in '16.

I do still see the petrochemical resurgence in the United States continuing, both in terms of additional crackers and the further downstream derivatives. So there is an example of where the U.S. will be there. The Westinghouse projects kind of skew us back towards almost that 50-50 or 60-40 kind of range in terms of U.S. versus non-U.S. business.

These are -- there's a lot of competitors and they like to feed their house, too. And depending on how hungry they are is how they act in terms of pricing. So we still see that as pretty tough market. But again, the way we're -- the way we change, the way we're doing work applies to Power, just like it applies to some of the other businesses. So we're kind of changing the game a little bit, and I think we've got a competitive offering. Infrastructure is a little bit the same way, but we're starting to see some of these things come to fruition. And we're winning. And we're winning in things that we already know how to do, roads and light rail. And we're winning with acceptable margin with our partner. So I feel reasonably okay there. The other businesses are doing quite fine. We've talked a lot about oil and gas. Our ability and the quality of the margin and backlog that I spoke off is, I think, a testament to changing the model of how we deliver, which makes us more competitive in the marketplace. Our Government business has done quite well. We really hadn't talked about that when we went to Idaho. And a really, really huge win for us and it's something we're really pleased with, which, again, if you think about it, that adds -- and with the Stork acquisition, it adds to that non-commodity piece of our business, which should surprise -- provide some stability in earnings over the longer term. Those are big, long 3- to 5-year kind of contracts. So again, going back to a part of my comment with -- to Jamie, that also gives us confidence in our ability to end '16 and start '17 with a pretty robust capability in terms of earning potential. So this is hard business. I mean -- and it's always competitive. It's never easy in terms of what our competition confronts us with or what our client expectations are. And I'm just really proud of our organization, how we respond to that and how we've responded as an organization to a new way of doing business, the results and better margin performance across the board."

And when you look at those demand growths, we're still looking at 1 million barrels a day kind of growth in the mid-term, I would say. So when you think about some of the production that's going to naturally come off due to depletion curves, you look at -- I guess, the Saudis and the Russians kind of put, for lack of a better term, a ceiling on production. You can see where that glut's going to clear pretty quickly. I think what's different this time is, in a lot of these producing countries, their cost base has gone up because of the social programs. So I think they're going to do what they can to turn this more quickly than maybe would have taken place when you -- even if you go back into the '70s and what the embargo did. So I'm not sure you can actually do a comparison to the '90s. Not sure you can do a comparison to the '70s or even if you go back into the early 2000s when pricing went down. I just think it's a different marker. And I'll give you an example. This is the first time in my career where -- when the sabers rattle between anybody in the Middle East that threatens the Straits of Hormuz, and I'm speaking specifically about the issue between the Saudis and the Iranians that obviously was in the press, the oil price didn't spike by $10 a barrel the next day. And in fact, this time, it went down. So I would argue that the fundamentals are significantly different today in terms of who's producing and how much they're producing and the change and the flow of those products over the last decade, more gas, more LNG, LNG glut right now. Oil is there. Coal is bad. I mean, I just think that there's a lot of issues that are different in this cycle than they were in the past. But I think the one thing that's going to drive maybe a quicker recovery than some of the historical times is the need for a cost per barrel that satisfies the social needs of some of these producers."

But Warren Buffett says that he's nervous when people are greedy and he's greedy when people are nervous. Well, right now, people are nervous, and we've got the powder to deal with the things we need to deal with."

As I said in my opening remarks, we do expect commodity prices to stay low, and we'll continue to drive customers' decisions. But I do know that they're going to continue to spend and focus on these high-quality projects that we have in our sites. 
As I've mentioned, our integrated solutions approach has met the demand in terms of our customers' need for capital-efficient projects, and we'll continue to work on that and hopefully continue to drive down those costs. This is not a demand that will subside when commodity prices begin to improve. 
To that end, the changes we've made in our business model have prepared us for the next cycle, and that next cycle will come. We've been through this -- I've been in this business a long time and what is now down will go up again. 
The evolution of our offerings, I think, has provided us with robust cash flow generation, as I mentioned earlier, and just strengthens our balance sheet and our ability to continue to operate. 
I think our cost management discipline also gives us an advantage and an opportunity to be more successful in the future. 
Not to say that '16 is going to be an easy year, it's going to be a difficult year, but I think there's great opportunity as we go through this to continue to deliver for our shareholders.

On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016. Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full year results, I do want to spend a few minutes to share my perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth continues to be weak and commodity prices remain low. We expect economic growth for the year to be similar of the past few years, yet we also expect commodity prices to stabilize during this year and perhaps even begin to improve in the last part of the year. The lower commodity prices, obviously, continue to impact our customers' cash flows and therefore, their ability to fund certain projects at the same pace that they had done previously. 
Many of our customers have already announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2016. However, Fluor serves a diverse portfolio of industries and regions. This provides the company opportunities even in difficult market environments. While low oil prices may delay some oil & gas projects, Fluor is focused on our clients and their spending priorities. 
As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to see the FID on large greenfield LNG facilities to move to the right as clients focus on opportunities to improve capital efficiency. By that extension, it's important to note that we do not anticipate any material contributions from LNG projects during 2016. Our Power business should experience strong growth this year with the Westinghouse projects now fully transitioned plus the business has experienced an uptick in gas-related projects. 
Our government and infrastructure markets are also experiencing growth with key recent wins, including the $1.4 billion nuclear cleanup project in Idaho and the Arizona Loop 202 project. We also expect to hear shortly the outcome of our bid to build the 16-mile Purple Line light rail project in Maryland. We continue to implement our integrated solution strategy. Our strategy focuses on delivering the full spectrum of capital efficient solutions for our customers. 
We've taken significant steps in 2015 to broaden our offering, including expanding our global fabrication footprint with the announcement of the COOEC joint venture in China and extending our position in the construction and maintenance markets through the Westinghouse Nuclear Awards and our upcoming acquisition of Stork. While we're talking about fabrication investments and historic acquisition, let me give you an update on the closing status. Our JV with COOEC and the Zhuhai fabrication yard continues to progress. We're receiving final approvals now and expect to make our first payment in the next few months. 
Back in December, we announced the intent to acquire Stork, a maintenance and modification and asset integrity company based in The Netherlands. Stork enhances not only our current offering, but creates tremendous opportunity to leverage our combined capabilities and brands across a broad spectrum of opportunities. We anticipate this transaction to also close in the next few months. 
While we expect 2016 to be another challenging year, our focus will be on the things that we can control. Now let's look at our 2015 full year results beginning with Slide 5 -- Slide 3. Excluding a pretax nonoperating pension settlement expense of $240 million, net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $571 million or $3.89 per diluted share compared with $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for 2015 was $1 billion, which compares to $1.3 billion a year ago. Despite volatile oil prices, our Oil & Gas segment performed very well during the year, contributing $764 million in segment profit, a 14% increase over 2014. However, this increase was offset by the decline in other segments. Segment profits -- profit margins were 5.7%, which compares with 5.9% a year ago. 
Consolidated 2015 revenue was $18.1 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago. Full year new awards were $21.8 billion, including $11 billion in Oil & Gas, $6 billion in Power, $3.2 billion in Industrial and Infrastructure and $1.4 billion in Government. Consolidated backlog for the year ended -- ending was $44.7 billion, up 5% from $42.5 billion a year ago. Our clients have not given any indication that they intend to cancel any ongoing projects with us. 
Turning to Slide 4. The Oil & Gas segment booked $2.1 billion in new awards, including 2 Pemex refining projects in Mexico. Ending backlog for that segment was $28.8 billion, which compares to $28.5 billion in 2014. Fourth quarter new awards in industrial and infrastructure were $302 million. We closed the year with a backlog of $5.6 billion compared to $7.2 billion at the end of 2014, which reflects the reduced Mining & Metals new award activity. 
The Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $352 million, and they're ending backlog in 2015 was $3.6 billion. Turning to Slide 5 in the Power segment. Fourth quarter new awards were $5.1 billion, including an award for 2 reimbursable contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at 2 nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina. Ending backlog in 2015 was $6.8 billion, which compares to $2.1 billion a year ago. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a $31 million charge related to a gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia. This was primarily related to commissioning, taking longer than expected due to changes and challenges associated with the installation of the gas turbines that extended past the third quarter. This project has reached mechanical completion, and we anticipate turning this project over to the customer in the spring. 
With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $5.5 billion a year ago. All segments reported slight year-over-year reductions, with the exception of industrial infrastructure, which experienced a 41% decline mainly due to the continued reduction in mining activity. Excluding the pension settlement expense of $231 million, or $1.04 per diluted share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.68 compared to $1.41 a year ago. 
Including pension settlement expenses, the company reported a loss of $51 million or $0.36 per diluted share. This quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.21 per share due to the combined effect of the $31 million charge on the Brunswick Power project and a higher-than-expected tax rate due to losses at 2 foreign subsidiaries that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. These tax effects can reverse in the future. 
Over the course of the year, we've received a few questions about the impact of foreign exchange rates on the P&L. Looking at the impact of FX on a quarterly basis, there is very little variation. However, when you look at FX from a yearly impact, 2015 versus 2014, using average rates over both periods, there is a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.20. Corporate G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $53 million a year ago. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial position remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, flat with a year ago. In 2015 the company generated $849 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $643 million in 2014. The company also returned $635 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the first quarter of 2015 as you recall, we also settled a claim for discontinued operations of $306 million. Absent that, cash flow from operations would be even stronger. The previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 through the end of 2015. For the year, we repurchased 10,105,000 shares. On February 4, 2016, the Board of Directors increased our outstanding share repurchase reauthorization by 10 million shares. However, although our cash position is strong at year-end, everyone should keep in mind that we have existing near-term commitments for our cash. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $44.7 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 22% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 41% U.S. and 59% non-U.S. For the year, backlog was negatively impacted by about $3 billion as a result of the strong dollar. 
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. We are maintaining our guidance for 2016 at $3.50 to $4 per share. Our guidance for 2016 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million and a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale expenses of approximately $90 million as we get to DCA submittal later this year, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million and our payments to fund our joint venture with COOEC of $350 million in the first half and $140 million in the third quarter of this year. Our guidance does not include any benefit related to our acquisition of Stork nor any transaction and integration-related cost. This transaction is expected to close as early as March. Our guidance reflects an expectation of gradual quarterly improvement in 2016. 
With that operator, we're ready to take questions."

But just based on your commentary that customers are slowing spend over a longer period of time. You knew that you had Westinghouse when you initially gave your guide in the third quarter. It doesn't seem like tax rate has changed, so I'm just trying to get a sense, have the puts and takes of the guidance changed relative to -- and even though we're still at the same place relative to where we were last quarter? And then David, I guess my other question to you is, Andy is trying to ask about Oil & Gas revenue and operating profit for 2016 or margins. But I guess, my concern is -- or what I'm trying to understand is, how do I think about the run rate of Oil & Gas profits as we exit the year? Because my concern I guess, is more as we think about '17, if awards don't materialize this year in Oil & Gas, which I don't think they do, how do I think about how materially down earnings can be in 2017 because I can't think of a good reason why -- outside of what we know about Westinghouse and Stork, why the other businesses could actually sort of make up for the decline that we're going to see in Oil & Gas?"

But our diversity does provide those puts and takes that you mentioned. And yes, there have been puts and takes that keeps us at the guidance where we are, which is the value of the diversity that we enjoy. If we were just an oil and gas company, you'd have probably seen us reduce things like a lot of other folks have over the last few quarters. But that diversity pays off. The ability to take on big projects in Power helps that earnings stream. Our ability to do operations and maintenance work. Our ability to work in the pharmaceutical business and the infrastructure sector, all helps us from a diversity standpoint maintain earnings power. So I think that we've got the opportunity to perform as we suggested at the end of the third quarter. Relative to Oil & Gas, right now as we see it, the year will be reasonably strong. And as we enter '17, assuming that a couple of things happen that we anticipate, '17 should be equally as strong in terms of Oil & Gas. So I guess, there's a bit of a bearish tone in terms of the overall, and most of that bearish tone is coming from the press. I'm fairly bullish about our ability to deliver on '16. I'm pretty bullish about our position in the marketplace to add backlog as -- at least, stay flat with backlog as we enter '17. So the glass is half full, and I don't see the doom and gloom that a lot of people and, I guess, your question kind of leads us towards."

We're seeing an uptick in opportunity in the Infrastructure group. They kind of hit a lull as you ended '14 and early '15. And we're seeing a significant slate of opportunities that are there. And part of that is I think the U.S. government focus on infrastructure and the things that are necessary to keep the U.S. economy going. So that's a bright spot. We're seeing an uptick in terms of pharmaceutical and biotech opportunities with the FDA approving drugs. Some of those projects are getting off of a -- off the mark. We're seeing a significant amount of front-end work, steady work on gas-fired power plants, and we see a pretty robust opportunity slate there. When you look at Oil & Gas though, you've got to peel the onion and peel it this way: Number one, there is no drilling going on. The rig -- you can read the rig counts just like anybody else. We don't have any exposure to that. You can look at the big deepwater drilling, the horizontal drilling in some difficult places obviously, that's slowing. Well, we don't do that either. We are seeing however, a fair amount of work in traditional offshore and traditional onshore upstream Oil & Gas and significant FEED work in those areas because they're -- the oil companies have kind of taken their deep breath and they're looking at, okay, what are the priorities? And now those priorities are coming out as studies and FEEDs in those markets. And those are slow, but they're coming. I think the FEED activity that's picked up as I said earlier has been in refining and it continues to be in petrochemicals and fine chemicals. So you've kind of got to peel the onion and the things that we have exposure to, we're still seeing a pretty robust slate of front-end work that, again, gives us kind of visibility going back to Jamie's question about '17. We've got good visibility into the priority of the projects that our customers were taking, the economic viability of those projects based on current economic factors and that's what leads us to say that we'll have a pretty robust new award slate that -- and robust to me means equal to this year and certainly, it provides some visibility into the opportunities for '17. So again, I go back to what I said during Jamie's question, the glass is half full. And it's half full for us because of the fact that we've really stuck to our customers, and we've answered their call for integrated solutions and capital efficiency."

I was at an event this morning at the Dallas Fed, and the same kind of discussion was taking place. It's interesting. I remember it, and I've said it on these calls before and in private meetings with you guys. I sat in Saudi Arabia in 1997 and oil was $17 a barrel, up from $11. This isn't the first time me or people within our industry or our company, have seen these kind of swings and volatility in markets. And they will fix themselves. I mean, when you think right now, there's an oversupply of oil products. There's an oversupply of gas. There's an oversupply of LNG. It's going to take a while for that to clear, but it will clear. And when you think about particularly, the Oil & Gas customers, they haven't said they're going to stop spending. They said they're going to cut their capital spending. And that just means that they're going to prioritize and look at those high-valued projects, which is one of the litmus tests or selectivity says that we use in terms of what projects we actually pursue. So again, I think our strategy is sound in terms of how we want to face the market and how we want to deal with the customers and which projects do we want to prioritize on. But that does not mean that we're not going to continue to look at our strategy, focus on cash management, focus on lower -- continuing to find areas of how we do our projects to lower cost to meet that demand that the customer is asking for in terms of capital efficiency. So we're going to continue to work. And as I said in the prepared remarks, focus on the things that we can control. And right now, that's how we focus on the customers, and how we sell a different way of doing projects that delivers what they're asking for."

So it has really come down, as a result of lower mining activity it came down year-over-year as a result of Afghanistan. But most of that was really reflected as lower levels of equipment back to the end of 2014. So we'll see. But we think that certainly there's prospects for that business to pick up as we support our own -- start our own projects in construction, in 2016. In terms of capital deployment, as I said, initially we've got -- we have a healthy cash balance. We're really happy with how we generated cash last year and expect to do a great job at generating cash again this year. But we have some expenditures right in front of us in terms of the funding of the China fabrication joint venture. As I said in my comments, there's $500 million over the course of the year or just under $500 million that has to be funded. So over the very near term, I think we have places that we figure generate great returns over time to go invest in. Beyond that, our strategy remains the same as it has in the past, typically. We don't expect to preannounce any kind of a share repurchase program. What we expect to do is as we go through time, evaluate our excess capital as it's generated. What to see first, if there's some high investment opportunity that will create a good return for shareholders. High investment return opportunity that'll create a great return for shareholders. And then if -- in the absence of that, we'll look to see if we repurchase shares just like we have in the past. But it's not a near-term analysis we had to go through because as I said, we've got some near-term opportunities for our cash. Commitments we've already made. We'll generate good cash flow in the future, we have that expectation, so we'll look forward to having to do that analysis going forward."

But they got these things pinned up on their drawing board and they want to get them going and they can move pretty rapidly.

But once that glut kind of clears, I think you're going to see commodity prices kind of stabilize, if not rise, as we get to the back end. But the other thing that I'd warn everybody about is when you think about the long-term nature of oil and gas developments, from exploratory well to production is a decade. So they're not thinking about spending today for tomorrow, they're thinking about spending today so that either their reserve base or their product mix or whatever is focused on that further -- longer view. And they're going to continue to fund those projects that satisfy that need. So 2 ways of answering your question. One, they can turn quick. I don't anticipate it in '16.

So we're kind of changing the game a little bit, and I think we've got a competitive offering. Infrastructure is a little bit the same way, but we're starting to see some of these things come to fruition. And we're winning. And we're winning in things that we already know how to do, roads and light rail. And we're winning with acceptable margin with our partner. So I feel reasonably okay there. The other businesses are doing quite fine. We've talked a lot about oil and gas. Our ability and the quality of the margin and backlog that I spoke off is, I think, a testament to changing the model of how we deliver, which makes us more competitive in the marketplace. Our Government business has done quite well. We really hadn't talked about that, but we won Idaho. And a really, really huge win for us and something we're really pleased with, which, again, if you think about it, that adds -- and with the Stork acquisition, it adds to that non-commodity piece of our business, which should surprise -- provide some stability in earnings over the longer term. Those are big, long 3- to 5-year kind of contracts. So again, going back to a part of my comment with -- to Jamie, that also gives us confidence in our ability to end '16 and start '17 with a pretty robust capability in terms of earnings potential.

And when you look at those demand growths, we're still looking at 1 million barrels a day kind of growth in the mid-term, I would say. So when you think about some of the production that's going to naturally come off due to depletion curves, you look at -- I guess, the Saudis and the Russians kind of put, for lack of a better term, a ceiling on production. You can see where that glut's going to clear pretty quickly. I think what's different this time is, in a lot of these producing countries, their cost base has gone up because of the social programs. So I think they're going to do what they can to turn this more quickly than maybe would have taken place when you -- even if you go back into the '70s and what the embargo did. So I'm not sure you can actually do a comparison to the '90s. Not sure you can do a comparison to the '70s or even if you go back into the early 2000s when pricing went down. I just think it's a different marker. And I'll give you an example. This is the first time in my career where -- when the sabers rattle between anybody in the Middle East that threatens the Straits of Hormuz, and I'm speaking specifically about the issue between the Saudis and the Iranians that obviously was in the press, that oil price didn't spike by $10 a barrel the next day. And in fact, this time, it went down. So I would argue that the fundamentals are significantly different today in terms of who's producing and how much they're producing and the change in the flow of those products over the last decade, more gas, more LNG, LNG glut right now. Oil is there. Coal is bad. I mean, I just think that there's a lot of issues that are different in this cycle than they were in the past. But I think the one thing that's going to drive maybe a quicker recovery than some of the historical times is the need for a cost per barrel that satisfies the social needs of some of these producers."

I remember back in the day when they used to plan on $14. It was the kind of the litmus test for capital spend. So it'll morph and change, but I think there's a huge wake-up call that $100 isn't something that's there forever. But I also remember everybody saying the sky would fall and the world would end if it ever went above $100. That didn't happen either.

As I said in my opening remarks, we do expect commodity prices to stay low, and we'll continue to drive customers' decisions. But I do know that they're going to continue to spend and focus on these high-quality projects that we have in our sights. 
As I've mentioned, our integrated solutions approach has met the demand in terms of our customers' need for capital-efficient projects, and we'll continue to work on that and hopefully continue to drive down those costs. This is not a demand that will subside when commodity prices begin to improve. 
To that end, the changes we've made in our business model have prepared us for the next cycle, and that next cycle will come. We've been through this -- I've been in this business a long time and what is now down will go up again.

Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full year results, I do want",972,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016. Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full year results, I do want to spend a few minutes to share my perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth continues to be weak and commodity prices remain low. We expect economic growth for the year to be similar of the past few years, yet we also expect commodity prices to stabilize during this year and perhaps even begin to improve in the last part of the year. The lower commodity prices, obviously, continue to impact our customers' cash flows and therefore, their ability to fund certain projects at the same pace that they had done previously. 
Many of our customers have already announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2016. However, Fluor serves a diverse portfolio of industries and regions. This provides the company opportunities even in difficult market environments. While low oil prices may delay some oil & gas projects, Fluor is focused on our clients and their spending priorities. 
As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to see the FID on large greenfield LNG facilities to move to the right as clients focus on opportunities to improve capital efficiency. By that extension, it's important to note that we do not anticipate any material contributions from LNG projects during 2016. Our Power business should experience strong growth this year with the Westinghouse projects now fully transitioned plus the business has experienced an uptick in gas-related projects. 
Our government and infrastructure markets are also experiencing growth with key recent wins, including the $1.4 billion nuclear cleanup project in Idaho and the Arizona Loop 202 project. We also expect to hear shortly the outcome of our bid to build the 16-mile Purple Line light rail project in Maryland. We continue to implement our integrated solution strategy. Our strategy focuses on delivering the full spectrum of capital efficient solutions for our customers. 
We've taken significant steps in 2015 to broaden our offering, including expanding our global fabrication footprint with the announcement of the COOEC joint venture in China and extending our position in the construction and maintenance markets through the Westinghouse Nuclear Awards and our upcoming acquisition of Stork. While we're talking about fabrication investments and historic acquisition, let me give you an update on the closing status. Our JV with COOEC and the Zhuhai fabrication yard continues to progress. We're receiving final approvals now and expect to make our first payment in the next few months. 
Back in December, we announced the intent to acquire Stork, a maintenance and modification and asset integrity company based in The Netherlands. Stork enhances not only our current offering, but creates tremendous opportunity to leverage our combined capabilities and brands across a broad spectrum of opportunities. We anticipate this transaction to also close in the next few months. 
While we expect 2016 to be another challenging year, our focus will be on the things that we can control. Now let's look at our 2015 full year results beginning with Slide 5 -- Slide 3. Excluding a pretax nonoperating pension settlement expense of $240 million, net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $571 million or $3.89 per diluted share compared with $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for 2015 was $1 billion, which compares to $1.3 billion a year ago. Despite volatile oil prices, our Oil & Gas segment performed very well during the year, contributing $764 million in segment profit, a 14% increase over 2014. However, this increase was offset by the decline in other segments. Segment profits -- profit margins were 5.7%, which compares with 5.9% a year ago. 
Consolidated 2015 revenue was $18.1 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago. Full year new awards were $21.8 billion, including $11 billion in Oil & Gas, $6 billion in Power, $3.2 billion in Industrial and Infrastructure and $1.4 billion in Government. Consolidated backlog for the year ended -- ending was $44.7 billion, up 5% from $42.5 billion a year ago. Our clients have not given any indication that they intend to cancel any ongoing projects with us. 
Turning to Slide 4. The Oil & Gas segment booked $2.1 billion in new awards, including 2 Pemex refining projects in Mexico. Ending backlog for that segment was $28.8 billion, which compares to $28.5 billion in 2014. Fourth quarter new awards in industrial and infrastructure were $302 million. We closed the year with a backlog of $5.6 billion compared to $7.2 billion at the end of 2014, which reflects the reduced Mining & Metals new award activity. 
The Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $352 million, and they're ending backlog in 2015 was $3.6 billion. Turning to Slide 5 in the Power segment. Fourth quarter new awards were $5.1 billion, including an award for 2 reimbursable contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at 2 nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina. Ending backlog in 2015 was $6.8 billion, which compares to $2.1 billion a year ago. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a $31 million charge related to a gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia. This was primarily related to commissioning, taking longer than expected due to changes and challenges associated with the installation of the gas turbines that extended past the third quarter. This project has reached mechanical completion, and we anticipate turning this project over to the customer in the spring. 
With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $5.5 billion a year ago. All segments reported slight year-over-year reductions, with the exception of industrial infrastructure, which experienced a 41% decline mainly due to the continued reduction in mining activity. Excluding the pension settlement expense of $231 million, or $1.04 per diluted share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.68 compared to $1.41 a year ago. 
Including pension settlement expenses, the company reported a loss of $51 million or $0.36 per diluted share. This quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.21 per share due to the combined effect of the $31 million charge on the Brunswick Power project and a higher-than-expected tax rate due to losses at 2 foreign subsidiaries that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. These tax effects can reverse in the future. 
Over the course of the year, we've received a few questions about the impact of foreign exchange rates on the P&L. Looking at the impact of FX on a quarterly basis, there is very little variation. However, when you look at FX from a yearly impact, 2015 versus 2014, using average rates over both periods, there is a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.20. Corporate G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $53 million a year ago. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial position remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, flat with a year ago. In 2015 the company generated $849 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $643 million in 2014. The company also returned $635 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the first quarter of 2015 as you recall, we also settled a claim for discontinued operations of $306 million. Absent that, cash flow from operations would be even stronger. The previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 through the end of 2015. For the year, we repurchased 10,105,000 shares. On February 4, 2016, the Board of Directors increased our outstanding share repurchase reauthorization by 10 million shares. However, although our cash position is strong at year-end, everyone should keep in mind that we have existing near-term commitments for our cash. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $44.7 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 22% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 41% U.S. and 59% non-U.S. For the year, backlog was negatively impacted by about $3 billion as a result of the strong dollar. 
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. We are maintaining our guidance for 2016 at $3.50 to $4 per share. Our guidance for 2016 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million and a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale expenses of approximately $90 million as we get to DCA submittal later this year, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million and our payments to fund our joint venture with COOEC of $350 million in the first half and $140 million in the third quarter of this year. Our guidance does not include any benefit related to our acquisition of Stork nor any transaction and integration-related cost. This transaction is expected to close as early as March. Our guidance reflects an expectation of gradual quarterly improvement in 2016. 
With that operator, we're ready to take questions."

I guess, I was a bit surprised that you maintained your guide given you don't assume any contribution from Stork, which I get because it hasn't closed yet. But just based on your commentary that customers are slowing spend over a longer period of time. You knew that you had Westinghouse when you initially gave your guide in the third quarter. It doesn't seem like tax rate has changed, so I'm just trying to get a sense, have the puts and takes of the guidance changed relative to -- and even though we're still at the same place relative to where we were last quarter? And then David, I guess my other question to you is, Andy is trying to ask about Oil & Gas revenue and operating profit for 2016 or margins. But I guess, my concern is -- or what I'm trying to understand is, how do I think about the run rate of Oil & Gas profits as we exit the year? Because my concern I guess, is more as we think about '17, if awards don't materialize this year in Oil & Gas, which I don't think they do, how do I think about how materially down earnings can be in 2017 because I can't think of a good reason why -- outside of what we know about Westinghouse and Stork, why the other businesses could actually sort of make up for the decline that we're going to see in Oil & Gas?"

But our diversity does provide those puts and takes that you mentioned. And yes, there have been puts and takes that keeps us at the guidance where we are, which is the value of the diversity that we enjoy. If we were just an oil and gas company, you'd have probably seen us reduce things like a lot of other folks have over the last few quarters. But that diversity pays off. The ability to take on big projects in Power helps that earnings stream. Our ability to do operations and maintenance work. Our ability to work in the pharmaceutical business and the infrastructure sector, all helps us from a diversity standpoint maintain earnings power. So I think that we've got the opportunity to perform as we suggested at the end of the third quarter. Relative to Oil & Gas, right now as we see it, the year will be reasonably strong. And as we enter '17, assuming that a couple of things happen that we anticipate, '17 should be equally as strong in terms of Oil & Gas. So I guess, there's a bit of a bearish tone in terms of the overall, and most of that bearish tone is coming from the press. I'm fairly bullish about our ability to deliver on '16. I'm pretty bullish about our position in the marketplace to add backlog as -- at least, stay flat with backlog as we enter '17. So the glass is half full, and I don't see the doom and gloom that a lot of people and, I guess, your question kind of leads us towards."

We're seeing an uptick in opportunity in the Infrastructure group. They kind of hit a lull as you ended '14 and early '15. And we're seeing a significant slate of opportunities that are there. And part of that is I think the U.S. government focus on infrastructure and the things that are necessary to keep the U.S. economy going. So that's a bright spot. We're seeing an uptick in terms of pharmaceutical and biotech opportunities with the FDA approving drugs. Some of those projects are getting off of a -- off the mark. We're seeing a significant amount of front-end work, steady work on gas-fired power plants, and we see a pretty robust opportunity slate there. When you look at Oil & Gas though, you've got to peel the onion and peel it this way: Number one, there is no drilling going on. The rig -- you can read the rig counts just like anybody else. We don't have any exposure to that. You can look at the big deepwater drilling, the horizontal drilling in some difficult places obviously, that's slowing. Well, we don't do that either. We are seeing however, a fair amount of work in traditional offshore and traditional onshore upstream Oil & Gas and significant FEED work in those areas because they're -- the oil companies have kind of taken their deep breath and they're looking at, okay, what are the priorities? And now those priorities are coming out as studies and FEEDs in those markets. And those are slow, but they're coming. I think the FEED activity that's picked up as I said earlier has been in refining and it continues to be in petrochemicals and fine chemicals. So you've kind of got to peel the onion and the things that we have exposure to, we're still seeing a pretty robust slate of front-end work that, again, gives us kind of visibility going back to Jamie's question about '17. We've got good visibility into the priority of the projects that our customers were taking, the economic viability of those projects based on current economic factors and that's what leads us to say that we'll have a pretty robust new award slate that -- and robust to me means equal to this year and certainly, it provides some visibility into the opportunities for '17.

This isn't the first time me or people within our industry or our company, have seen these kind of swings and volatility in markets. And they will fix themselves. I mean, when you think right now, there's an oversupply of oil products. There's an oversupply of gas. There's an oversupply of LNG. It's going to take a while for that to clear, but it will clear. And when you think about particularly, the Oil & Gas customers, they haven't said they're going to stop spending. They said they're going to cut their capital spending. And that just means that they're going to prioritize and look at those high-valued projects, which is one of the litmus tests or selectivity says that we use in terms of what projects we actually pursue. So again, I think our strategy is sound in terms of how we want to face the market and how we want to deal with the customers and which projects do we want to prioritize on.

So I think that we'll not go too far in answering your question. But certainly, I think that much of what we have in revenue, the substantial majority of it is already in backlog. If you look at how we talked about margins over the last couple of months going back to the third quarter call and then presentations since then, if you aggregate that all together, you're probably on a consolidated basis, somewhere in the plus 4% range. But where exactly that lands, it's a tough call, there's just too many variables. So we feel good about the extent that our revenues are covered significantly by what's in backlog. Yes, there is some book and burn. I think that as we said, the key variable there then is the timing of new awards and how fast that comes in.

So it has really come down, as a result of lower mining activity it came down year-over-year as a result of Afghanistan. But most of that was really reflected as lower levels of equipment back to the end of 2014. So we'll see. But we think that certainly there's prospects for that business to pick up as we support our own -- start our own projects in construction, in 2016. In terms of capital deployment, as I said, initially we've got -- we have a healthy cash balance. We're really happy with how we generated cash last year and expect to do a great job at generating cash again this year. But we have some expenditures right in front of us in terms of the funding of the China fabrication joint venture. As I said in my comments, there's $500 million over the course of the year or just under $500 million that has to be funded. So over the very near term, I think we have places that we figure generate great returns over time to go invest in. Beyond that, our strategy remains the same as it has in the past, typically. We don't expect to preannounce any kind of a share repurchase program. What we expect to do is as we go through time, evaluate our excess capital as it's generated. What to see first, if there's some high investment opportunity that will create a good return for shareholders. High investment return opportunity that'll create a great return for shareholders. And then if -- in the absence of that, we'll look to see if we repurchase shares just like we have in the past. But it's not a near-term analysis we had to go through because as I said, we've got some near-term opportunities for our cash. Commitments we've already made. We'll generate good cash flow in the future, we have that expectation, so we'll look forward to having to do that analysis going forward."

But they got these things pinned up on their drawing board and they want to get them going and they can move pretty rapidly. As I said, I don't think you're going to see the supply situation change dramatically until -- as we get into mid part of the year. But once that glut kind of clears, I think you're going to see commodity prices kind of stabilize, if not rise, as we get to the back end. But the other thing that I'd warn everybody about is when you think about the long-term nature of oil and gas developments, from exploratory well to production is a decade. So they're not thinking about spending today for tomorrow, they're thinking about spending today so that either their reserve base or their product mix or whatever is focused on that further -- longer view. And they're going to continue to fund those projects that satisfy that need. So 2 ways of answering your question. One, they can turn quick. I don't anticipate it in '16.

So we still see that as a pretty tough market. But again, the way we're -- the way we've change, the way we're doing work applies to Power, just like it applies to some of the other businesses. So we're kind of changing the game a little bit, and I think we've got a competitive offering. Infrastructure is a little bit the same way, but we're starting to see some of these things come to fruition. And we're winning. And we're winning in things that we already know how to do, roads and light rail. And we're winning with acceptable margin with our partner. So I feel reasonably okay there. The other businesses are doing quite fine. We've talked a lot about oil and gas. Our ability and the quality of the margin and backlog that I spoke off is, I think, a testament to changing the model of how we deliver, which makes us more competitive in the marketplace. Our Government business has done quite well. We really hadn't talked about that, but we won Idaho. And a really, really huge win for us and something we're really pleased with, which, again, if you think about it, that adds -- and with the Stork acquisition, it adds to that non-commodity piece of our business, which should surprise -- provide some stability in earnings over the longer term. Those are big, long 3- to 5-year kind of contracts. So again, going back to a part of my comment with -- to Jamie, that also gives us confidence in our ability to end '16 and start '17 with a pretty robust capability in terms of earnings potential. So this is a hard business. I mean -- and it's always competitive. It's never easy in terms of what our competition confronts us with or what our client expectations are.

And when you look at those demand growths, we're still looking at 1 million barrels a day kind of growth in the mid-term, I would say. So when you think about some of the production that's going to naturally come off due to depletion curves, you look at -- I guess, the Saudis and the Russians kind of put, for lack of a better term, a ceiling on production. You can see where that glut's going to clear pretty quickly. I think what's different this time is, in a lot of these producing countries, their cost base has gone up because of the social programs. So I think they're going to do what they can to turn this more quickly than maybe would have taken place when you -- even if you go back into the '70s and what the embargo did. So I'm not sure you can actually do a comparison to the '90s. Not sure you can do a comparison to the '70s or even if you go back into the early 2000s when pricing went down. I just think it's a different marker. And I'll give you an example. This is the first time in my career where -- when the sabers rattle between anybody in the Middle East that threatens the Straits of Hormuz, and I'm speaking specifically about the issue between the Saudis and the Iranians that obviously was in the press, that oil price didn't spike by $10 a barrel the next day. And in fact, this time, it went down. So I would argue that the fundamentals are significantly different today in terms of who's producing and how much they're producing and the change in the flow of those products over the last decade, more gas, more LNG, LNG glut right now. Oil is there. Coal is bad. I mean, I just think that there's a lot of issues that are different in this cycle than they were in the past. But I think the one thing that's going to drive maybe a quicker recovery than some of the historical times is the need for a cost per barrel that satisfies the social needs of some of these producers."

So I think in their backrooms now, they're thinking $40, $50 kind of range is the new norm, and we have to plan on that basis. And we're already seeing them use a more reasonable number. I remember back in the day when they used to plan on $14. It was the kind of the litmus test for capital spend. So it'll morph and change, but I think there's a huge wake-up call that $100 isn't something that's there forever. But I also remember everybody saying the sky would fall and the world would end if it ever went above $100. That didn't happen either. So I think what we're hearing from our customers is there's kind of a new norm. And somewhere between $40 and $70 is probably the kind of the sweet spot for the longer term."

As I said in my opening remarks, we do expect commodity prices to stay low, and we'll continue to drive customers' decisions. But I do know that they're going to continue to spend and focus on these high-quality projects that we have in our sights. 
As I've mentioned, our integrated solutions approach has met the demand in terms of our customers' need for capital-efficient projects, and we'll continue to work on that and hopefully continue to drive down those costs. This is not a demand that will subside when commodity prices begin to improve. 
To that end, the changes we've made in our business model have prepared us for the next cycle, and that next cycle will come. We've been through this -- I've been in this business a long time and what is now down will go up again. 
The evolution of our offerings, I think, has provided us with robust cash flow generation, as I mentioned earlier, and just strengthens our balance sheet and our ability to continue to operate. 
I think our cost management discipline also gives us an advantage and an opportunity to be more successful in the future.

On today's call, we'll review our first quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Before I get started, I wanted to comment on the tragedy that occurred 2 weeks ago in Mexico. As you may have read, 3 Fluor employees and 29 subcontractors were killed in an explosion at PNV petrochemical plant in the state of, Mexico. Fluor was performing a revamp project at the site when the explosion occurred. The client is currently conducting their investigation in conjunction with the authorities and engaging with third-party experts into the cause of the accident. At this stage, there is no indication that the event was related to our activities at the site. So if you think I'm a little somber today, I am. This is the worst accident in Fluor's history. This tragic event serves as a reminder to us all that we must hold our core value of safety at the center of all we do. At this very difficult time, our hearts are with the families and the friends of those killed in the tragic event.
Now moving to our first quarter results. I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets we serve. Global economic growth in the first quarter was weak, setting up another subpar year. Many economists have lowered their growth expectations for 2016. Crude oil and metal prices remain relatively low, which continues to suppress the cash flows of some of our customers and is causing some of the pricings to shift to the right. For our commodity-influenced businesses, we are beginning to see clients reevaluate projects through studies and pre-feeds. Going forward, we do expect clients to continue to take a cautious, disciplined approach when they make their capital investment decisions. 
Oil and natural gas prices on the other hand, continue to support the investment in North American chemicals projects as well as gas-fired power plants. In fact, we're actively working on the beginning stages. We're bidding 4 separate new ethylene crackers in the United States. The recently passed FAST, which is Fixing America's Service Transportation Act, I'd like to know who come up with these names, they're really inventive. It is supportive however, of the new transportation infrastructures in the United States and we expect the government's to be supportive of these investments in the infrastructure market. 
We also see good opportunities for growth in our industrial government and our maintenance capital markets. Our focus on the integrated solutions and capital efficiencies continues to resonate with our customers and has positioned us well for projects as they move forward. Finally, most of you have seen our release from last month's announcing our new reporting segments. We changed how we report our segments to better reflect how I, and the rest of the management team view the diverse end markets that we serve. Business line results will now be segmented by our commodity influenced businesses, Energy and Chemicals and Mining; our predominantly fixed price businesses; Industrial, Infrastructure and Power, Government; and our operating expense focused business, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity. The MMAI group also includes our recent acquisition of Stork. 
Now let's look at our first quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the first quarter were $104 million or $0.74 per diluted share, excluding pretax expenses related primarily early to the recent acquisition of Stork. Net earnings attributable to Fluor were $120 million or $85 -- or $0.85 per share compared with $114 million or $0.96 a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $241 million compared to $276 million a year ago. Improvements in our Government and Industrial and Infrastructure and Power segments were offset by declines in other segments. Segment profit. Margins were 5.5% compared to 5.4% last quarter and 6.1% a year ago. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion comparable to the results reported last quarter and a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $4.7 billion. Consolidated backlog at the quarter-end was $46 billion [ph] up 12% from $41.2 billion a year ago. Of the $5 billion increase, $1.5 billion is a result of our acquisition of Stork that was completed in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Energy and Chemicals and Mining, booked $579 million in new awards. Ending backlog was $26.8 billion compared to $29.7 billion a year ago. Of this amount, only $481 million is in the backlog is in mining. Now we believe the mining market will not significantly improved in the near future. 
First quarter new awards in Industrial and Infrastructure and Power were $1.4 billion and included the Loop 202 Freeway Project in Arizona. Looking ahead, we've been successful in weighing the South Carolina port access road in Charleston, South Carolina, which will be a second quarter award and the Maryland Purple Line project, which we expect to achieve financial close in the second half of this year. I'm particularly encouraged by our successful bid in South Carolina as it's a great example of our ability to be competitive on smaller, but still critically important projects. I'm also pleased to report that the gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia is essentially complete with no additional charges in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had a tremendous quarter with new awards of $2.3 billion. This includes the Idaho cleanup project and multiyear extension of the Portsmouth project both in the DOE space. Ending backlog was $5.2 billion, up from $4.2 billion a year ago. The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $404 million and ending backlog was $3.7 billion. Biggs will go into the details on our first quarter performance. But before he does, I want to give you some color on our changes and guidance for 2016.
We revised our -- our revised range takes into consideration the projects we are currently working on that we've seen stretch out over the last few months with Sasol and Pemex as examples. Additionally, the process to reach FID continues to take longer than anticipated. Of course, this leads to the question on how we see 2017 shaping up and my response is that while we have a nice backlog today that will support earnings in 2016 and beyond, it's still too early to tell when and how our clients will proceed with our capital performance plans. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of the operating performance and corporate financial metrics. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $4.5 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure and Power and MMAI were offset by a decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment. Operationally, this quarter was lined with our expectations. This quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.74 included cost related to our acquisition of Stork and an unrelated legal settlement. Excluding these expenses, the earnings per diluted share were $0.85. I also wanted to point out that first quarter results included a 1 month of Stork operations. Stork's business is seasonal with typically lower results in the first and fourth quarters. 
The tax rate for the quarter was higher than normal. There were a number of factors, including some nondeductible expenses, but the biggest contributor was losses that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. For the main 3 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 34% to 36%. Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $55 million compared to $41 million a year ago. This increase is largely due to the Stork acquisition and the legal settlement I just mentioned. If it were not for those expenses, which aggregated into $22 million, G&A would've been down year-over-year. With the near-term softness of book and burn in the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment, we will continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our model. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2 billion compared to $2.4 billion last quarter and $2.2 billion a year ago. During the quarter, we made our initial $350 million contributions to the COOEC Fluor fabrication joint venture in China. A second payment of $140 million will be made in the third quarter. Quarterly cash flow from operating activities was $115 million and we paid $30 million in dividends. Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $46 million. The percentage of fixed price contracts on our overall backlog was 24% at quarter end and the mix by geography was sorted 43% U.S. and 57% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although new awards and backlog position us well for the long-term, clients in our Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment, continue to stretch out existing work and defer issuing final investment decisions. Sasol's recent announcement of extending private discussion and its petrochemical facility in Louisiana is but one example. To go ahead and answer a frequent question in advance, there have been no significant cancellations and we do not anticipate any. The burner backlog is lower than we've all observed. Some of this is due to clients like Sasol and Pemex where projects are well underway, but have been stretched out or, which are on a slow pace. But much of it is due to the fact that many rewards in backlog are very large and actually burn more slowly such as the Westinghouse nuclear projects. 
In long-term O&M contracts and our recent infrastructure awards and the multi-year government projects. Backlog burn is also nationally slower when backlog has grown as opposed to when it contracts. Having said all that, the delays in the project stretch out have a near-term effect, this has resulted in a lower-than-expected trajectory for full year revenue. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing its 2016 guidance range from $3.50 to $4 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share. Our guidance for 2016 included the Stork transaction and integration costs, also an assumed G&A expense with the range of $200 million to $220 million. Other expectations for 2016 include expenses of approximately $90 million as we progress towards DCA submittal, which is targeted by the end of the year and capital expenditures for the corporation of approximately $300 million. 
Under the new reporting segments, we anticipate near-term margins for the Energy, Chemicals and Mining group to be in the mid to upper 6% range, Industrial and Infrastructure and NuScale, to be in the 4.5% to 5.5% range. Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity give you around 5% to 6%, and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Probably in the range of mid to high single digits from a percent accretion standpoint next year. But some of those are going to be within Stork, and some of them will be outside because we think that we have the opportunity to create more revenue and opportunity with this Stork as opposed to it being part of Fluor.

So there are numbers out there for the historical performance. But there was $100 million roughly of EBITDA at a run-rate basis last year. We talked about that in the release where we announced the acquisition. But there were depreciation expenses and there are some noncontrolling interest and other elements to take into consideration. So if you just took that EBITDA number and floated through without any consideration of the other expenses, you'd probably ended up with too high an estimate. As to the rest of the business then, the -- there is some year-over-year decline in our equipment business, which we've talked about. And it was evident again this quarter. But otherwise, there's not a big year-over-year decline and everything else that you'd have to be factoring in. So I think your -- over time, we obviously, expect Stork to be a big contributor. But you would've been high in that initial estimate. On integration expenses to go ahead and so you can figure this as well. In total, the $0.11 we had for the quarter was integration transaction costs, plus there was a legal charge in there. We're going to have a little bit more in integration expenses over the remainder of the year, although it will certainly be less than what we had here in the first quarter.

This isn't our first rodeo so to speak. And when industry takes a deep breath like their Oil & Gas industry has and they push things to the right, one of the unintended consequences of that is what could end up being a boom as we get into the out years. Because they still got to do these development. I mean, I've said this before. I mean, it's 10 years from an exploration well to production. And certain companies have to put every year something in the neighborhood of 200,000 barrels a day back into their reserve base just to stay flat. So spending will continue. It's not like they've stopped spending. In fact, in Chevron's call, they talked about the Tingeese [ph] project continuing to go forward, which we're clearly working on that job. So there's upside there. But I think as we get into a little bit later into this year, we'll see. I mean, I think there's still significant production just in Texas alone. There's still based on financial hedges, so there's still people being paid $60 a barrel that will end as we get into the summer. So you're going to see -- this is David Seaton's crystal ball, you're going to see the glut of those projects clear reasonably quickly to where I believe you'll see oil inch up to somewhere in the low 50s as we get into the first half of next year. I think most companies have gotten really comfortable with that $40 being the new norm -- $50 being the new norm. And they'll start their spending again. So I think, what I'm really pleased with is the fact that in the face of that, the diversity of our company allowed us to have what was a really good new award quarter. And we see those markets continuing to grow. As I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, I'm really pleased with that South Carolina award because it proves that our new model can produce much more efficient and effective competitive bids. When you look at that market just alone, the infrastructure market, there's going to be a hell of a lot more $200 million jobs than $2 billion jobs. And there's going to be those 2 like the Purple Line project, but it shows that the diversity allows us to skate to where the puck is going to be, to steal from Gretzky. And I think we'll continue to do that. There's lots of programs in the industrial space. There's very large pharmaceutical biotech projects that we're chasing. There's a lot more government work that we're chasing. There's Power projects that we're chasing. So the opportunity slate is still pretty robust even in Oil & Gas. And I think we're well positioned to be much more competitive than we've been in the past. And clearly, we're going to be contractor of choice."

And many of those people are headed to the Purple Line in Maryland. So we feel pretty good about our place in the infrastructure market. And frankly speaking, we see that as one of the growth areas. As you mentioned, we've been very successful this year. But I'd point you to last year where we were very unsuccessful. By and large, because of some predatory pricing by the competition. So not only do we see good opportunity, but we also have good solid projects in terms of backlog margin as we burn that and as we execute. So I'm pretty bullish on the infrastructure market and as I said in the previous question and the prepared remarks, the fact that we can be competitive in an open procurement, more than 200 kind of million dollar project, I think bodes well for that group."

And I think -- well actually, 3 pieces. The first piece is I think it gives the state's confident, I'm talking about just specifically U.S. it gives the states confidence to push some of these things through that there will be some federal funding associated with what they've got to do. Every state that we really focus on has significant legislation on -- in the works, I'll say. This support a very large amount of projects to come to fruition. The other piece of it is going to be some of these shovel-ready projects in fixing potholes to everything else. And we're not really going to focus on that. But every one of these programs at these states are looking at, has significant bridge work, have significant toll road opportunities, which the public-private partnership, which is the last piece are going to have to play a role. Now one of the things that some of the states need to do is they need to make it legal to do public-private partnerships for infrastructure programs. Not every state has that kind of laws in the books that allows it. But I think that we're finally at a point where the deterioration of the infrastructure in the United States is to a point where we got to do something. This port access project is just the first piece of the Charleston Port expansion. So winning this one puts us in a good position to get the next one. But there's lots and lots of programs that we're going to have access to and I'm really pretty bullish on that market. But again, I'm not sure it's going to be this year that we're going to see significantly new awards because these projects take a long time to put together. And I'll point to the Eagle P3 project in Denver. That project started in discussion in 2003. And we just opened it. So there's a long tail to these things. But they've got a good earnings stream and they're on the road for a long period of time. When you look at the Eagle P3, we've got a 28-year maintenance contract that started when we opened it last week. So again, it goes to another question that was asked. When you look at infrastructure, it builds a good base over the longer term that we could use to grow from."

Other than that, those projects kind of hit the ground running because they're already underway. So there's a $5 billion award over roughly 5 years, you've got that 20% burning each year. So it was just in rough terms that's how you look at the burn within the Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment being affected by those awards. This is interesting because it is interesting book and burn, but it still brings the average burn rate down because it's a 5-year project.

So I think that we can move -- we're going to reallocate resources around the globe. I think this first model is working in showing that we don't need to hire and fire like the normal cycles that dictated in the past. I'd point to Houston as an example. There's been a size at least in the last little while as high as 4,800 people. And it's around 2,800 people now and it has been for 2.5 years -- 3 years. And we don't expect it to drop much more than that.

As I said in the opening remarks and certainly in the Q&A, we continue to see that low commodity prices are driving customers to extend projects and delay FID decisions based on cash flow. This, I think, coupled with a little bit slower pace associated with some of the larger projects we've won over the past couple of years. In the long, O&M contracts, we recently put into place and infrastructure and others, have a slower burn might provide I think a more stable revenue trajectory. 
The revised 2016 guidance range reflects I think this reality. While our capital structure is sound and our cash flow generation remains robust, we remain disciplined in how we use our cash and we'll continue to do so as we look at lowering our cost of business and costs associated with it. Finally, we continue to invest for the long-term. As you've seen with our recent investments in the fab yard and certainly Stork, it positions our company to not only take care or capture market share in the traditional markets, but it also allows us to show growth in some of the longer-term aspects of our business.

On today's call, we'll review our first quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Before I get started, I wanted to comment on the tragedy that occurred 2 weeks ago in Mexico. As you may have read, 3 ICA Fluor employees and 29 subcontractors were killed in an explosion at PMV petrochemical plant in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. ICA Fluor was performing a revamp project at the site when the explosion occurred. The client is currently conducting their investigation in conjunction with the authorities and engaging with third-party experts into the cause of the accident. At this stage, there is no indication that the event was related to our activities at the site. So if you think I'm old somber today, I am. This is the worst accident in Fluor's history. This tragic event serves as a reminder to us all that we must hold our core value of safety at the center of all we do. At this very difficult time, our hearts are with the families and the friends of those killed in the tragic event.
Now moving to our first quarter results, I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth for the first quarter was weak, setting up another subpar year. Many economists have lowered their growth expectations for 2016. Crude oil and metal prices remain relatively low, which continues to suppress the cash flows of some of our customers and is causing some of the projects to shift to the right. For our commodity-influenced businesses, we are beginning to see clients reevaluate projects through studies and pre-FEEDs. Going forward, we do expect clients to continue to take a cautious, disciplined approach when they make their capital investment decisions. 
Low natural gas prices on the other hand continue to support investment in North American chemicals projects as well as gas-fired power plants. In fact, we're actively working on the beginning stages. We're bidding 4 separate new ethylene crackers in the United States. 
The recently passed FAST, which is Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act -- I'd like to know who comes up with these names. They're really inventive. It is supportive, however, of the new transportation infrastructure spend in the United States, and we expect the governments to be supportive of these investments in the infrastructure market. 
We also see good opportunities for growth in our industrial government and our maintenance capital markets. Our focus on the integrated solutions and capital efficiencies continues to resonate with our customers and has positioned us well for projects as they move forward. 
Finally, most of you have seen our release from last month's announcing our new reporting segments. We changed how we report our segments to better reflect how I and the rest of the management team view the diverse end markets that we serve. Business line results will now be segmented by our commodity-influenced businesses, Energy & Chemicals and Mining; our predominantly fixed-price businesses, Industrial & Infrastructure and Power; Government; and our operating expense-focused business, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity. The MMAI group also includes our recent acquisition of Stork. 
Now let's look at our first quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the first quarter were $104 million or $0.74 per diluted share, excluding pretax expenses related primarily to the recent acquisition of Stork. Net earnings attributable to Fluor were $120 million or $0.85 per share compared with $114 million or $0.96 a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $241 million compared to $276 million a year ago. Improvements in our Government and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by declines in other segments. 
Segment profit. Margins were 5.5% compared to 5.4% last quarter and 6.1% a year ago.  Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, comparable to the results reported last quarter and a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $4.7 billion. 
Consolidated backlog at the quarter-end was $46 billion, up 12% from $41.2 billion a year ago. Of the $5 billion increase, $1.5 billion is a result of our acquisition of Stork that was completed in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4. Energy, Chemicals & Mining, booked $579 million in new awards. Ending backlog was $26.8 billion compared to $29.7 billion a year ago. Of this amount, only $481 million is in -- backlog is in mining. Now we believe the mining market will not significantly improved in the near future. 
First quarter new awards in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $1.4 billion and included the Loop 202 Freeway Project in Arizona. Looking ahead, we've been successful in weighing the South Carolina Port Access Road in Charleston, South Carolina, which will be a second quarter award, and the Maryland Purple Line project, which we expect to achieve financial close in the second half of this year. I am particularly encouraged by our successful bid in South Carolina, as it's a great example of our ability to be competitive on smaller but still critically important projects. I'm also pleased to report that the gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia, is essentially complete with no additional charges in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had a tremendous quarter with new awards of $2.3 billion. This includes the Idaho Cleanup Project and multiyear extension of the Portsmouth project, both in the DOE space. Ending backlog was $5.2 billion, up from $4.2 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $404 million, and ending backlog was $3.7 billion. 
Biggs will go into the details on our first quarter performance, but before he does, I want to give you some color on our changes in guidance for 2016.
We revised our -- our revised range takes into consideration the projects we are currently working on that we've seen stretch out over the last few months, with Sasol and Pemex as examples. Additionally, the process to reach FID continues to take longer than anticipated. Of course, this leads to the question on how we see 2017 shaping up, and my response is that while we have a nice backlog today that will support earnings in 2016 and beyond, it's still too early to tell when and how our clients will proceed with our capital deployment plans. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of the operating performance and corporate financial metrics. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance, then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $4.5 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, infrastructure & Power and MMAI were offset by decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment.  Operationally, this quarter was aligned with our expectations. This quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.74 included cost related to our acquisition of Stork and an unrelated legal settlement. Excluding these expenses, the earnings per diluted share were $0.85. I also want to point out that first quarter results include only 1 month of Stork operations. Stork's business is seasonal with typically lower results in the first and fourth quarters. 
The tax rate for the quarter was higher than normal. There were a number of factors, including some nondeductible expenses, but the biggest contributor was losses that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. For the remaining 3 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 34% to 36%. 
Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $55 million compared to $41 million a year ago. This increase was largely due to the Stork acquisition and a legal settlement I just mentioned. If were not those expenses, which aggregated into $22 million, G&A would have been down year-over-year. With the near-term softness of book and burn in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we will continue to be diligent by taking costs out of our model. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2 billion compared to $2.4 billion last quarter and $2.2 billion a year ago. During the quarter, we made our initial $350 million contribution to the COOEC Fluor fabrication joint venture in China. A second payment of $140 million will be made in the third quarter. 
Quarterly cash flow from operating activities was $115 million, and we paid $30 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $46 million. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 24% at quarter-end, and the mix by geography was sorted 43% U.S. and 57% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although new awards and backlog position us well for the long term, clients in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment continue to stretch out existing work and defer issuing final investment decisions. Sasol's recent announcement of extending project construction at its petrochemical facility in Louisiana is but one example. 
To go ahead answer a frequent question in advance, there have been no significant cancellations, and we do not anticipate any. The burner backlog is low as we've all observed. Some of this was due to clients like Sasol and Pemex, where projects are well underway but have been stretched out, or Kitimat, which are on a slow pace. But much of it is due to the fact that many of the awards in backlog are very large and actually burn more slowly, such as the Westinghouse nuclear projects, and long-term O&M contracts on our recent infrastructure awards, and the multiyear government projects.  Backlog burn is also naturally [ph] slower, when backlog has grown as opposed to when it contracts. 
Having said all that, the delays in the project's stretch-out have a near-term effect. This has resulted in a lower-than-expected trajectory for full year revenue. Taking this consideration, the company is reducing its 2016 guidance range from $3.50 to $4 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share. 
Our guidance for 2016, included this Stork transaction and integration costs, also assumed G&A expense at the range of $200 million to $220 million. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale's expenses of approximately $90 million, as we progress towards DCA submittal, which is targeted by the end of the year, and capital expenditures for the corporation of approximately $300 million. 
Under the new reporting segments, we anticipate near-term margins for the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the mid- to upper-6% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 4.5% to 5.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 5% to 6%; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

So there are numbers out there for their historical performance. But there was $100 million, roughly, of EBITDA at a run rate basis last year. We talked about that in the release where we announced the acquisition. But there were depreciation expenses and there are some noncontrolling interest and other elements to take into consideration. So if you just took that EBITDA number and floated through without a consideration of the other expenses, you'd probably end it up with too high an estimate. As to the rest of the business then, the -- there is some year-over-year decline in our equipment business, which we've talked about, and it was evident again this quarter. But otherwise, there is not a big year-over-year decline and everything else that you'd have to be factoring in. So I think your -- over time, we obviously expect Stork to be a big contributor, but you would have been high in that initial estimate. On second, integration expenses, you go ahead and so you can figure this as well. In total, the $0.11 we had for the quarter was integration transaction cost, plus there was a legal charge in there. We're going to have a little bit more in integration expenses over the remainder of the year, although it will certainly be less than what we had here in the first quarter. So it's just going to be a few million dollars more anyway."

This isn't our first rodeo, so to speak. And when industry takes a deep breath like their oil and gas industry has and they push things to the right, one of the unintended consequences of that is what could end up being a boom as we get into the out years because they still got to do these developments. I mean, I've said this before. I mean, it's 10 years from a exploration well to production, and certain companies have to put every year something in the neighborhood of 200,000 barrels a day back into their reserve base just to stay flat. So spending will continue. It's not like they've stopped spending. In fact, in Chevron's call, they talked about the Tengiz project continuing to go forward, which we're clearly working on that job. So there is upside there. But I think as we get into a little bit later into this year, we'll see. I mean, I think there is still significant production just in Texas alone that are still based on financial hedges. So there are still people being paid $60 a barrel that will end as we get into the summer. So you are going to see -- this is David Seaton's crystal ball, you're going to see the glut of those projects clear reasonably quickly to where I believe you'll see oil inch up to somewhere in the low 50s as we get into the first half of next year. I think most companies have gotten really comfortable with that $40 being the new norm, $50 being the new norm, and they'll start their spending again. So I think what I'm really pleased with is the fact that in the face of that, the diversity of our company allowed us to have what was a really good no-award quarter. And we see those markets continuing to grow. As I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, I'm really pleased with that South Carolina award because it proves that our new model can produce much more efficient and effective competitive bids. When you look at that market just alone, the infrastructure market, there is going to be a hell of a lot more $200 million jobs than $2 billion jobs. And there's going to be those 2 like the Purple Line project. But it shows that the diversity allows us to skate to where the puck is going to be, to steal from Gretzky, and I think we'll continue to do that. There's lots of programs in the industrial space. There is very large pharmaceutical biotech projects that we're chasing. There's a lot more government work that we're chasing. There's power projects that we're chasing. So the opportunity slate is still pretty robust even in oil and gas. And I think we're well positioned to be much more competitive than we've been in the past, and clearly, we're going to be contractor of choice."

And I think -- well, actually, 3 pieces. The first piece is I think it gives the states confidence. I'm talking about just specifically U.S. It gives the states confidence to push some of these things through, that there will be some federal funding associated with what they've got to do. Every state that we really focus on has significant legislation on -- in the works, I'll say, that support a very large amount of projects to come to fruition. The other piece is going to be some of these shovel-ready projects in fixing potholes to everything else. We're not really going to focus on that. But every one of these programs that these states are looking at have significant bridge work, have significant toll road opportunities, which the public-private partnership, which is the last piece, are going to have to play a role. Now one of the things that some of the states need to do is they need to make it legal to do public-private partnerships for infrastructure programs. Not every state has that kind of law in the books that allows it. But I think that we're finally at a point where the deterioration of the infrastructure in the United States is to a point where we got to do something. This Port Access Project is just the first piece of the Charleston Port expansion. So winning this one puts us in a good position to get the next one. But there's lots and lots of programs that we're going to have access to, and I'm really pretty bullish on that market. But again, I'm not sure it's going to be this year that we're going to see significantly new awards because these projects take a long time to put together. And I'll point to the Eagle P3 Project in Denver. That project started in discussion in 2003, and we just opened it. So there's a long tail to these things. But they've got a good earnings stream, and they're over a long period of time. When you look at the Eagle P3, we've got a 28-year maintenance contract that started when we opened it last week. So again, it goes to another question that was asked. When you look at the infrastructure, it builds a good base over the longer term that we can use to grow from."

Other than that, those projects kind of hit the ground running because they're already underway. So it's a $5 billion award over roughly 5 years. You've got [indiscernible] 20% of that burning each year. So it was just in rough terms. That's how you look at the burn within the Industrial & Infrastructure and Power segment being affected by those awards. This is interesting because it is instant book and burn, but it still brings the average burn rate down because it's a 5-year project. Other than that, I think that there's no other rule anomalies to point out. It's an interesting question. That's one thing that I don't know that we recast for everybody was historical backlog numbers to -- so that they can see what historical book and burn would be.

And we'll clearly add the additive to that. But I don't see a capacity issue. And we've added -- when you think about the resources from the 2 nukes in Stork, we're over 60,000 employees now. And I still believe we're the employer of choice given our ability to retain people. So I think that we can move -- we're going to reallocate resources around the globe. I think our dispersed model is working and showing that we don't need to hire and fire like the normal cycles have dictated in the past. I'd point to Houston as an example, and it's been as high as -- at least in the last little while, as high as 4,800 people. And it's around 2,800 people now, and it has been for 2.5 years -- 3 years. And we don't expect it to drop much more than that. So again, some of the things we've done to perfect the dispersed execution model, I think, gives us a lot more stability in the -- across the portfolio, but it also shows that when we need to turn the crank, we can bring in the people we need almost regardless of how big we need to be."

As I said in the opening remarks and certainly in the Q&A, we continue to see that low commodity prices driving customers to extend projects and delay FID decisions based on cash flow. This, I think, coupled with a little bit slower pace associated with some of the larger projects, we've won over the past couple of years. In the long term, O&M contracts we've recently put into place in infrastructure and others have a slower burn and might provide, I think, a more stable revenue trajectory. 
The revised 2016 guidance range reflects, I think, this reality. While our capital structure is sound and our cash flow generation remains robust, we remain disciplined in how we use our cash, and we'll continue to do so as we look at lowering our cost of business and internal costs associated with it. 
Finally, we continue to invest for the long term. As you've seen with our recent investments in the fab yard and certainly Stork, it positions our company to not only take care of capture market share in the traditional markets, but it also allows us to show growth in some of the longer-term aspects of our business.

On today's call, we'll review our first quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Before I get started, I wanted to comment on the tragedy that occurred 2 weeks ago in Mexico. As you may have read, 3 ICA Fluor employees and 29 subcontractors were killed in an explosion at PMV petrochemical plant in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. ICA Fluor was performing a revamp project at the site when the explosion occurred. The client is currently conducting their investigation in conjunction with the authorities and engaging with third-party experts into the cause of the accident. At this stage, there is no indication that the event was related to our activities at the site. So if you think I'm a little somber today, I am. This is the worst accident in Fluor's history. This tragic event serves as a reminder to us all that we must hold our core value of safety at the center of all we do. At this very difficult time, our hearts are with the families and the friends of those killed in the tragic event.
Now moving to our first quarter results, I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets we serve. 
Global economic growth for the first quarter was weak, setting up another subpar year. Many economists have lowered their growth expectations for 2016. Crude oil and metal prices remain relatively low, which continues to suppress the cash flows of some of our customers and is causing some of the projects to shift to the right. For our commodity-influenced businesses, we are beginning to see clients reevaluate projects through studies and pre-FEEDs. Going forward, we do expect clients to continue to take a cautious, disciplined approach when they make their capital investment decisions. 
Low natural gas prices on the other hand continue to support investment in North American chemicals projects as well as gas-fired power plants. In fact, we're actively working on the beginning stages or bidding 4 separate new ethylene crackers in the United States. 
The recently passed FAST, which is Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act -- I'd like to know who comes up with these names. They're really inventive. It is supportive, however, of the new transportation infrastructure spend in the United States, and we expect the governments to be supportive of these investments in the infrastructure market. 
We also see good opportunities for growth in our industrial, government and our maintenance capital markets. Our focus on the integrated solutions and capital efficiencies continues to resonate with our customers and has positioned us well for projects as they move forward. 
Finally, most of you have seen our release from last month's announcing our new reporting segments. We changed how we report our segments to better reflect how I and the rest of the management team view the diverse end markets that we serve. Business line results will now be segmented by our commodity-influenced businesses, Energy & Chemicals and Mining; our predominantly fixed-price businesses, Industrial & Infrastructure and Power; Government; and our operating expense-focused business, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity. The MMAI group also includes our recent acquisition of Stork. 
Now let's look at our first quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the first quarter were $104 million or $0.74 per diluted share, excluding pretax expenses related primarily to the recent acquisition of Stork. Net earnings attributable to Fluor were $120 million or $0.85 per share compared with $114 million or $0.96 a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $241 million compared to $276 million a year ago. Improvements in our Government and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by declines in other segments. 
Segment profit. Margins were 5.5% compared to 5.4% last quarter and 6.1% a year ago.  Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, comparable to the results reported last quarter and a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $4.7 billion. 
Consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $46 billion, up 12% from $41.2 billion a year ago. Of the $5 billion increase, $1.5 billion is the result of our acquisition of Stork that was completed in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4. Energy, Chemicals & Mining, booked $579 million in new awards. Ending backlog was $26.8 billion compared to $29.7 billion a year ago. Of this amount, only $481 million is in -- the backlog is in mining. Now we believe the mining market will not significantly improve in the near future. 
First quarter new awards in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $1.4 billion and included the Loop 202 Freeway Project in Arizona. Looking ahead, we've been successful in winning the South Carolina Port Access Road in Charleston, South Carolina, which will be a second quarter award, and the Maryland Purple Line project, which we expect to achieve financial close in the second half of this year. I am particularly encouraged by our successful bid in South Carolina, as it's a great example of our ability to be competitive on smaller but still critically important projects. I'm also pleased to report that the gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia, is essentially complete with no additional charges in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had a tremendous quarter with new awards of $2.3 billion. This includes the Idaho Cleanup Project and multiyear extension of the Portsmouth project, both in the DOE space. Ending backlog was $5.2 billion, up from $4.2 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $404 million, and ending backlog was $3.7 billion. 
Biggs will go into the details on our first quarter performance, but before he does, I want to give you some color on our changes in guidance for 2016.
We revised our -- our revised range takes into consideration the projects we are currently working on that we've seen stretch out over the last few months, with Sasol and Pemex as examples. Additionally, the process to reach FID continues to take longer than anticipated. Of course, this leads to the question on how we see 2017 shaping up, and my response is that while we have a nice backlog today that will support earnings in 2016 and beyond, it's still too early to tell when and how our clients will proceed with their capital deployment plans. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of the operating performance and corporate financial metrics. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance, then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $4.5 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, infrastructure & Power and MMAI were offset by declines in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment.  Operationally, this quarter was aligned with our expectations. This quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.74 included costs related to our acquisition of Stork and an unrelated legal settlement. Excluding these expenses, earnings per diluted share were $0.85. I also want to point out that first quarter results include only 1 month of Stork operations. Stork's business is seasonal with typically lower results in the first and fourth quarters. 
The tax rate for the quarter was higher than normal. There were a number of factors, including some nondeductible expenses, but the biggest contributor was losses that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. For the remaining 3 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 34% to 36%. 
Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $55 million compared to $41 million a year ago. This increase was largely due to the Stork acquisition and the legal settlement I just mentioned. If for [ph] not those expenses, which aggregated into $22 million, G&A would have been down year-over-year. With the near-term softness of book and burn in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we will continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our model. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2 billion compared to $2.4 billion last quarter and $2.2 billion a year ago. During the quarter, we made our initial $350 million contribution to the COOEC Fluor fabrication joint venture in China. A second payment of $140 million will be made in the third quarter. 
Quarterly cash flow from operating activities was $115 million, and we paid $30 million in dividends. 
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $46 million. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 24% at quarter-end, and the mix by geography was sorted 43% U.S. and 57% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although new awards and backlog position us well for the long term, clients in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment continue to stretch out existing work and defer issuing final investment decisions. Sasol's recent announcement of extending project construction at its petrochemical facility in Louisiana is but one example. 
To go ahead and answer a frequent question in advance, there have been no significant cancellations, and we do not anticipate any. The burner backlog is low as we've all observed. Some of this was due to clients like Sasol and Pemex, where projects are well underway but have been stretched out, or Kitimat, which are on a slow pace. But much of it is due to the fact that many of the awards in backlog are very large and naturally burn more slowly, such as the Westinghouse nuclear projects, and long-term O&M contracts on our recent infrastructure awards, and the multiyear government projects.  Backlog burn is also naturally slower, when backlog has grown as opposed to when it contracts. 
Having said all that, the delays in the project that stretch-out have a near-term effect. This has resulted in a lower-than-expected trajectory for full year revenue. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing its 2016 guidance range from $3.50 to $4 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share. 
Our guidance for 2016, included the Stork transaction and integration costs, also assumed G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Other expectations for 2016 include NuScale's expenses of approximately $90 million, as we progress towards DCA submittal, which is targeted by the end of the year, and capital expenditures for the corporation of approximately $300 million. 
Under the new reporting segments, we anticipate near-term margins for the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the mid- to upper-6% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 4.5% to 5.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 5% to 6%; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

In terms of being more aggressive, I think that -- we're just going to stay prudent in terms of all of our investment activities.

So I'm really pleased that we've been that diligent in kind of rightsizing the organization before we needed to.

But next year, we certainly don't have the integration and transaction expenses we expect for synergies, which we think are going to be significant over time to be kicking in and for it to be accretive probably in the range of mid- to high single digits from a percent accretion standpoint next year. But some of those are going to be within Stork and some of them will be outside because we think that we have the opportunity to create more revenue and opportunity within Stork as opposed it being a part of Fluor, but correspondingly that they had EPC opportunities that were available to them, but which couldn't be fully fulfilled by them that now we'll be able to fulfill as a result of them being a part of the -- or us being the part of their offering."

So there are numbers out there for their historical performance. But there was $100 million, roughly, of EBITDA at a run rate basis last year. We talked about that in the release where we announced the acquisition. But there were depreciation expenses and there are some noncontrolling interest and other elements to take into consideration. So if you just took that EBITDA number and flowed through without a consideration of the other expenses, you'd probably ended up with too high of an estimate. As to the rest of the business then, the -- there is some year-over-year decline in our equipment business, which we've talked about, and it was evident again this quarter. But otherwise, there is not a big year-over-year decline and everything else that you'd have to be factoring in. So I think your -- over time, we obviously expect Stork to be a big contributor, but you would have been high in that initial estimate. And second, on integration expenses, to go ahead and so that you can think of this as well. In total, the $0.11 we had for the quarter was integration transaction costs, plus there was a legal charge in there. We will have a little bit more in integration expenses over the remainder of the year, although it will certainly be less than what we had here in the first quarter. So there's just going to be a few million dollars more anyway."

This isn't our first rodeo, so to speak. And when industry takes a deep breath like the oil and gas industry has and they push things to the right, one of the unintended consequences of that is what could end up being a boom as we get into the out years, because they've still got to do these developments. I mean, I've said this before. I mean, it's 10 years from an exploration well to production, and certain companies have to put, every year, something in the neighborhood of 200,000 barrels a day back into their reserve base just to stay flat. So spending will continue. It's not like they've stopped spending. In fact, in Chevron's call, they talked about the Tengiz project continuing to go forward, which we're clearly working on that job. So there is upside there. But I think as we get into a little bit later into this year, we'll see. I mean, I think there's still significant production just in Texas alone that are still based on financial hedges. So there are still people being paid $60 a barrel that will end as we get into the summer. So you are going to see -- this is David Seaton's crystal ball, you're going to see the glut of those products clear reasonably quickly to where I believe you'll see oil inch up to somewhere in the low 50s as we get into the first half of next year. I think most companies have gotten really comfortable with that $40 being the new norm, $50 being the new norm, and they'll start their spending again. So I think what I'm really pleased with is the fact that in the face of that, the diversity of our company allowed us to have what was a really good new-award quarter. And we see those markets continuing to grow. As I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, I'm really pleased with that South Carolina award because it proves that our new model can produce much more efficient and effective competitive bids. When you look at that market just alone, the infrastructure market, there is going to be a hell of a lot more $200 million jobs than $2 billion jobs. And there's going to be those 2 like the Purple Line project. But it shows that [ph] the diversity allows us to skate to where the puck is going to be, to steal from Gretzky, and I think we'll continue to do that. There's lots of programs in the industrial space. There’s very large pharmaceutical biotech projects that we're chasing. There's a lot more government work that we're chasing. There's power projects that we're chasing. So the opportunity slate is still pretty robust, even in oil and gas. And I think we're well positioned to be much more competitive than we've been in the past, and clearly, we're going to be contractor of choice."

And I think -- well, actually, 3 pieces. The first piece is I think it gives the states confidence. I'm talking about just specifically U.S. It gives the states confidence to push some of these things through, that there will be some federal funding associated with what they've got to do. Every state that we really focus on has significant legislation on -- in the works, I'll say, that support a very large amount of projects to come to fruition. The other piece is going to be some of these shovel-ready projects and fixing potholes to everything else. We're not really going to focus on that. But every one of these programs that these states are looking at have significant bridge work, have significant toll road opportunities, which the public-private partnership, which is the last piece, are going to have to play a role. Now one of the things that some of the states need to do is they need to make it legal to do public-private partnerships for infrastructure programs. Not every state has that kind of law on the books that allows it. But I think that we're finally at a point where the deterioration of the infrastructure in the United States is to a point where we've got to do something. This Port Access Project is just the first piece of the Charleston Port expansion. So winning this one puts us in a good position to get the next one. But there's lots and lots of programs that we're going to have access to, and I'm really pretty bullish on that market. But again, I'm not sure it's going to be this year that we're going to see significantly new awards because these projects take a long time to put together. And I'll point to the Eagle P3 Project in Denver. That project started in discussion in 2003, and we just opened it. So there's a long tail to these things. But they've got a good earnings stream, and they're over a long period of time. When you look at the Eagle P3, we've got a 28-year maintenance contract that started when we opened it last week. So again, it goes to another question that was asked. When you look at the infrastructure, it builds a good base over the longer term that we can use to grow from."

Other than that, those projects kind of hit the ground running because they're already underway. So it's a $5 billion award over roughly 5 years. You've got about 20% of that burning each year. So it was just in rough terms. That's how you'd look at the burn within the Industrial & Infrastructure and Power segment being affected by those awards. In that case, it's interesting because it is instant book and burn, but it still brings the average burn rate down because it's a 5-year project. Other than that, I think that there's no other real anomalies to point out. It's an interesting question. That's one thing that I don't know that we recast for everybody was the historical backlog numbers to -- so that they can see what historical book and burn would be.

And we'll clearly add the additive to that. But I don't see a capacity issue. And we've added -- when you think about the resources from the 2 nukes in Stork, we're over 60,000 employees now. And I still believe we're the employer of choice given our ability to retain people. So I think that we can move -- we're going to reallocate resources around the globe. I think our dispersed model is working and showing that we don't need to hire and fire like the normal cycles have dictated in the past. I'd point to Houston as an example, it's been as high as -- at least in the last little while, as high as 4,800 people. And it's around 2,800 people now, and it has been for 2.5 years -- 3 years. And we don't expect it to drop much more than that. So again, some of the things we've done to perfect the dispersed execution model, I think, gives us a lot more stability in the -- across the portfolio, but it also shows that when we need to turn the crank, we can bring in the people we need almost regardless of how big we need to be."

As I said in the opening remarks and certainly in the Q&A, we continue to see that low commodity prices are driving customers to extend projects and delay FID decisions based on cash flow. This, I think, coupled with a little bit slower pace associated with some of the larger projects, we've won over the past couple of years. In the long term, O&M contracts we've recently put into place, and infrastructure and others have a slower burn and  provide, I think, a more stable revenue trajectory. 
The revised 2016 guidance range reflects, I think, this reality. While our capital structure is sound and our cash flow generation remains robust, we remain disciplined in how we use our cash, and we'll continue to do so as we look at lowering our cost of business and internal costs associated with it. 
Finally, we continue to invest for the long term. As you've seen with our recent investments in the fab yard and certainly Stork, it positions our company to not only take care of -- capture market share in the traditional markets, but it also allows us to show growth in some of the longer-term aspects of our business. 
But with that, we greatly appreciate your interest in Fluor and your confidence in our company. Thank you and have a good evening."

But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2.
During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and our Form 10-K, which was filed back on February 18.
During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.

On the call, we'll review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. And I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets that we serve. 
During the past 2 years, we've experienced sluggish growth in the global economy and especially weak growth in industrial production. Commodity prices are volatile and I won't tell you anything you don't already know, but many geopolitical events have created uncertainty, which have impacted the decision making of our customers. When you think about -- there's been 20 ISIS attacks, there's -- in the last 12 months. You got Brexit, you got Paris, the climate change, TPP, et cetera, all leading to the stagnation of decisions that are being made.
Generally speaking, we expect continued slow recovery in the global economy and modest improvement in the EP spend -- EC&M market specifically. However, with that negative note, we are seeing capital spending return. We expect customers to award projects at a moderate pace and is evidenced by our award of a bauxite project in the second quarter in mining and the award of the recently announced Tengiz project, which we'll book in the third quarter. 
Despite the challenges in the past 12 months, we've done an excellent job building our non-Energy, Chemicals & Mining portfolio. Said another way, our 3 noncommodity focus segments have backlog of over $22 billion. This represents a 92% increase over this time last year. 
We continue to focus on becoming a more competitive company. As an example, in addition to the $100 million in overhead that we took out of our business in 2014, we are targeting an additional $80 million this year. I firmly believe the size and diversity of our backlog positions us well for the future. Now let's look at the second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3.
Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the second quarter were $102 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared with $149 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $230 million compared to $282 million a year ago. Improvements in our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by lower mining activity and forecast revisions on 2 projects in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. Consolidated segment profit margins were 4.7% compared to 5.5% last quarter and 5.9% a year ago. Segment margin for Energy, Chemicals & Mining was 5.1%. The effect of the 2 forecast revisions in this segment was 1.4%.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter and comparable with -- to the results of a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $6.4 billion. Consolidated backlog at the end was $47.3 billion, up 14% from $41.6 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $1.2 billion in new awards. This includes a $500 million award for a bauxite mine in Guinea, our first major mining award in over a year. Ending backlog was 27 -- sorry, $25 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
Looking ahead, we announced a few weeks ago that Tengiz has reached a final investment decision on the Tengiz oil expansion project in Kazakhstan. We're very proud to have been working at Tengiz since 1997, and I'm excited about this Fluor-led JV in supporting TCO in this next phase. We will be booking a multibillion-dollar award -- our portion of that award in the third quarter.
Second quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $3.4 billion and included the Purple Line Light Rail project in Maryland, South Carolina Port Access road in Charleston, South Carolina and the Greensville combined cycle power plant in Virginia. We've been very pleased with the pace of new awards in an infrastructure with 4 significant project wins in the last 4 quarters, Bergstrom Loop 202 in Arizona as well as the 2 I just mentioned. Ending backlog for this segment were $12.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5, the Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of $1.2 billion. Including task orders for LOGCAP IV, their ending backlog was $5.8 billion, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $664 million. This includes a 5-year maintenance and alliance contract for 6 power plants for Southern Company. And their backlog was $3.7 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago.
Our integration of Stork continues to progress, and we are in the process of expanding Stork's capabilities to additional markets. However, Stork's contributions are more than offset by other declines, including our equipment business due to continued slowdown in mining and delays in construction activities, particularly in Mexico, South America and Mozambique. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, which compares to $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, MMAI and Government were offset by a decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. MMAI gains were largely attributable to the Stork acquisition. 
As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.72 reflect the impact of forecast provisions on 2 projects. The tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at just under 34%. For the remaining 2 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 33% to 35%, although we may have an opportunity to do better than that.
Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $53 million compared to $48 million a year ago. This increase is largely due to Stork integration costs. While spot commodity prices have improved somewhat, we continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our organization. To put this in perspective, in the second quarter, we incurred $16 million in restructuring costs at the corporate G&A level, including Stork and another $7 million of restructuring expenses at the segment level.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion last quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $91 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $204 million for the same period last year. 
Last year had some unusual items, but this year, project working capital has grown. This increase was driven in part by normal project execution activities and the timing of billings on several projects, including delayed payments from our customers. While working capital may still have net growth for the full year, we expect it to decline from these levels. Timing always has a big impact. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $47.3 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog increased from 24% last quarter to 29% as a result of the Purple Line and Dominion Greensville awards and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power. At quarter end, the mix by geography was 45% U.S and 55% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although we are pleased to see significant awards across our and markets and the backlog positions us well for the long term, we continue to operate in an environment where customers continue with lower capital investment budgets and delayed final investment decisions. 
In addition, the backlog burn rate remains low whether by client direction or due to the size and complexity of the project. Having said all that, we would have been in a good position to maintain the previous guidance had it not been for the forecast provisions on the 2 projects. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing the upper end and narrowing its 2016 guidance range from $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share. The range has some upside to our normalized run rate for the first half because we think that there are opportunities for one or more favorable items to hit in the second half.
Since we mentioned the Purple Line award earlier, you may have seen that it may be delayed for an additional study. These are projects which ramp up very slowly, really not at a high level activity for a couple of years so this would not affect our 2016 guidance.
Our guidance for 2016 assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We anticipate margins for the remainder of the year in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the upper 5% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 4.5% to 5.5% range; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But as we've kind of signaled, there's going to be probably a pretty big quarter next quarter, which is TCO in that market. What's interesting right now in both mining and in oil and gas is we've seen over the last 2 years, with oil price being down, kind of pulling back, kind of reprioritizing their capital spend. And now they're to the point where they've got to do some things. I think mining, just pick on mining, I mean, I don't think anybody on this phone expected us to book a $500 million project in mining any time soon. And I would argue that, that's the first of several good awards, maybe not quite that size but we're starting to see some things loosen up in specific commodities. So I think mining has hit the bottom. And it was a pretty good -- pretty low bottom, and we're starting to see some improvement in that market. When you look across the realm of Energy & Chemicals, the same phenomenon is happening. The good projects are still moving forward, evidenced by TCO. Chemicals are still continuing to look at new crackers. In fact, I believe you're going to see probably a new cracker complex per year go to FID over the next several years if you're in the United States. So I think that all in all, we are going to start to see E&C kind of start to pick up -- pick back up based on what we're hearing from our customers and the things that we're bidding on. So I kind of feel like Energy & Chemicals kind of hit a low -- has had a low point last quarter, this quarter, but I don't see that as the normal run rate going forward in the next year."

Second half versus first half, I mean, I wouldn't take the as-reported numbers, [indiscernible] first 2 quarters and treat them as a run rate. I'd go back to the first quarter and I would take out the store transition costs and the legal matter that we recorded in the first quarter, and you'd add that back, I think you're in the mid-$0.80 range for the first quarter, around $0.85. And then if you normalize the second quarter for just the 2 projects, you're going to be up at $0.88 even if you don't address any of the restructuring cost. So then just take that $0.88 for the second quarter and assume that repeats itself and you're at $1.76, so now you're pretty close to the bottom of the range from the as-reported standpoint for the first half plus taking the second quarter on a normalized basis and applying it to the next 2 quarters. So -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, the range we have considered is that we're going to have some positive events, we believe, in the second half, which is more the norm for us to have positive events. We do record things fairly conservatively and more often than not, we have project provisions that are proven over time as opposed to downward revision, so we don't expect more of those. We would expect more to have some improvements and there's some areas I'm not going to go through specifically, but I mentioned tax rate, there's some particular some upside with respect to as well. So we have some things that we think are going to help us in the second half. But as I said, doing the math on the first to the second half, I think you're at the bottom range just by doing it on a normalized basis. And then the fact we have opportunity of some improvement enables us to establish a range above that."

But when you look at what we've been able to do over the last few years is build backlog, which will lead to revenue. Now we've said in the past that these projects are bigger and longer in duration, which to me is a good story because that means it services us for many years after awards. So I think we're at the point where we're going to start to see, as we did this quarter, revenue increases and obviously, the profitability that's there is going to follow that. So when you think about '17 is, I think, going to be still a reasonably difficult year just because of the lull that we experienced in new awards last year and the beginning of this year.

I still think we need some help from the legislative side of things in terms of funding and a comprehensive infrastructure plan. But one of the things I'm most pleased with is the balance of size of projects that we're going after. So obviously, you're going to have the big Purple Line kinds of projects and that's kind of in our sweet spot. But I'm particularly pleased with the South Carolina Port project. It's about a $200 million project, which proves to us that we can be competitive at that level of project. Now when you look at the future, particularly in the United States, you're going to see more $200 million projects than you're going to see $1.6 billion projects. So we've proven to ourselves that we know how to be competitive on those smaller projects and I think that's where the market's going to be. So if you get into '17, '18, obviously, you got to get past the election before really anything happens. When you get to '17, '18, there's a litany of projects in that $200 million, $250 million range that's in our sights. I'm expecting the infrastructure route to continue to grow, both in terms of the big projects because of those are things we're going to always go after, but more importantly, the balance that portfolio with the more moderate sized programs. So I'm really pleased with the changes that have been made there and kind of where we're headed."

Clearly, if you go back to one of my previous comments about infrastructure, what I'm pleased about in terms of those smaller projects, well, there's a lot of a lot more competitors out there that can do that. But the point I'd absolutely make is that there is absolutely no difference in the way we look at our contractual liabilities, what we're willing to accept as well as what types of margin we're willing to accept. And if that causes to lose some projects, so be it. We are going to maintain the discipline that I think is proven effective over 104 years of our history."

But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2.
During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and our Form 10-K, which was filed back on February 18.
During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. On the call, we'll review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, and I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets that we serve. 
During the past 2 years, we've experienced sluggish growth in the global economy and especially weak growth in the industrial production. Commodity prices are volatile. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but many geopolitical events have created uncertainty, which have impacted the decision making of our customers. When you think about the -- there's been 20 ISIS attacks. There's -- in the last 12 months, you got Brexit, you got Paris, the climate change, Accord [ph], TPP, et cetera, all leading to the stagnation of decisions that are being made. 
Generally speaking, we expect continued slow recovery in the global economy and modest improvement in the EC&M market specifically. However, with that negative note, we are seeing capital spending return. We expect customers to award projects at a moderate pace and is evidenced by our award of a bauxite project in the second quarter in mining and the award of the recently announced Tengiz project, which we'll book in the third quarter. 
Despite the challenges in the past 12 months, we've done an excellent job building our non-Energy, Chemicals & Mining portfolio. Said another way, our 3 noncommodity focus segments have backlog of over $22 billion. This represents a 92% increase over this time last year. 
We continue to focus on becoming a more competitive company. As an example, in addition to the $100 million in overhead that we took out of our business in 2014, we are targeting an additional $80 million this year. I firmly believe the size and diversity of our backlog positions us well for the future. 
Now let's look at the second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the second quarter were $102 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared with $149 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $230 million compared to $282 million a year ago. Improvements in our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by lower mining activity and forecast revisions on 2 projects in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. Consolidated segment profit margins were 4.7% compared to 5.5% last quarter and 5.9% a year ago. Segment margin for Energy, Chemicals & Mining was 5.1%. The effect of the 2 forecast revisions in this segment was 1.4%.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter and comparable with -- to the results of a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $6.4 billion. Consolidated backlog at the end was $47.3 billion, up 14% from $41.6 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $1.2 billion in new awards. This includes a $500 million award for a bauxite mine in Guinea, our first major mining award in over a year. Ending backlog was $25 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
Looking ahead, we announced a few weeks ago that the Tengizchevroil has reached a final investment decision on the Tengiz oil expansion project in Kazakhstan. We're very proud to have been working at Tengiz since 1997, and I'm excited about this Fluor-led JV in supporting TCO in this next phase. We will be booking a multibillion-dollar award -- our portion of that award in the third quarter.
Second quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $3.4 billion and included the Purple Line Light Rail project in Maryland; South Carolina Port Access road in Charleston, South Carolina; and the Greensville combined cycle power plant in Virginia. We've been very pleased with the pace of new awards in an infrastructure with 4 significant project wins in the last 4 quarters: Bergstrom, the Loop 202 in Arizona, as well as the 2 I just mentioned. 
Ending backlog for this segment were $12.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of $1.2 billion. Including task orders for LOGCAP IV, their ending backlog was $5.8 billion, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $664 million. This includes a 5-year maintenance and alliance contract for 6 power plants for Southern Company, and their backlog was $3.7 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago.
Our integration of Stork continues to progress, and we are in the process of expanding Stork's capabilities to additional markets. However, Stork's contributions are more than offset by other declines, including our equipment business due to continued slowdown in mining and delays in construction activities, particularly in Mexico, South America and Mozambique. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, which compares to $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, MMAI and Government were offset by a decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. MMAI gains were largely attributable to the Stork acquisition. 
As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.72 reflect the impact of forecast provisions on 2 projects. The tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at just under 34%. For the remaining 2 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 33% to 35%, although we may have an opportunity to do better than that.
Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $53 million compared to $48 million a year ago. This increase is largely due to Stork integration costs. While spot commodity prices have improved somewhat, we continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our organization. To put this in perspective, in the second quarter, we incurred $16 million in restructuring costs at the corporate G&A level, including Stork and another $7 million of restructuring expenses at the segment level.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash, plus current and noncurrent marketable securities, totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion last quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $91 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $204 million for the same period last year. 
Last year had some unusual items, but this year, project working capital has grown. This increase was driven in part by normal project execution activities and the timing of billings on several projects, including delayed payments from our customers. While working capital may still have net growth for the full year, we expect it to decline from these levels. Timing always has a big impact. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $47.3 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog increased from 24% last quarter to 29% as a result of the Purple Line and Dominion Greensville awards and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 45% U.S and 55% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although we are pleased to see significant awards across our various end markets, where the backlog positions us well for the long term, we continue to operate in an environment where customers continue with lower capital investment budgets and delayed final investment decisions. In addition, the backlog burn rate remains low whether by client direction or due to the size and complexity of the project. Having said all that, we would have been in a good position to maintain the previous guidance had it not been for the forecast provisions on the 2 projects. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing the upper end and narrowing its 2016 guidance range from $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share. The range has upside to our normalized run rate for the first half because we think that there are opportunities for one or more favorable items to hit in the second half.
Since we mentioned the Purple Line award earlier, you may have seen that it may be delayed for an additional study. These are projects which ramp up very slowly, really not at a high level activity for a couple of years, so this would not affect our 2016 guidance.
Our guidance for 2016 assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We anticipate margins for the remainder of the year in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the upper 5% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 4.5% to 5.5% range; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But as we've kind of signaled, there's going to be probably a pretty big quarter next quarter, which is on the back of TCO in that market. What's interesting right now in both mining and in oil and gas is we've seen over the last 2 years, with oil price being down, kind of pulling back, kind of reprioritizing their capital spend. And now they're to the point where they've got to do some things. I think mining, just pick on mining, I mean, I don't think anybody on this phone expected us to book a $500 million project in mining any time soon. And I would argue that, that's the first of several good awards, maybe not quite that size, but we're starting to see some things loosen up in specific commodities. So I think mining has hit the bottom, and it was a pretty low bottom, and we're starting to see some improvement in that market. When you look across the realm of Energy & Chemicals, the same phenomenon is happening. The good projects are still moving forward, evidenced by TCO. Chemicals are still continuing to look at new crackers. In fact, I believe you're going to see probably a new cracker complex per year go to FID over the next several years if you're in the United States. So I think that, all in all, we're going to start to see E&C kind of start to pick up -- pick back up based on what we're hearing from our customers and the things that we're bidding on. So I kind of feel like Energy & Chemicals kind of hit a low -- has hit a low point last quarter, this quarter, but I don't see that as the normal run rate going forward in the next year."

Second half versus first half, I mean, I wouldn't take the as-reported numbers, the first 2 quarters and treat them as a run rate.

Second half versus first half, I mean, I wouldn't take the as-reported numbers, the first 2 quarters and treat them as a run rate. I'd go back to the first quarter, and I would take out the store transition costs and the legal matter that we recorded in the first quarter. And you'd add that back, I think you're in the mid-$0.80 range for the first quarter, around $0.85. And then if you normalize the second quarter for just the 2 projects, you're going to be up at $0.88 even if you don't address any of the restructuring cost. So then just take that $0.88 for the second quarter and assume that repeats itself, and you're at $1.76. So now you're pretty close to the bottom of the range from the as-reported standpoint for the first half plus taking the second quarter on a normalized basis and applying it to the next 2 quarters. So -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, the range we have considered is that we're going to have some positive events, we believe, in the second half, which is more the norm for us to have positive events. We do record things fairly conservatively, and more often than not, we have project revisions that are an improvement over time as opposed to downward revision. So we don't expect more of those. We would expect more to have some improvements, and there's some areas, I'm not going to go through specifically. But I mentioned tax rate. There's some particular -- some upside with respect to as well. So we have some things that, we think, are going to help us in the second half. But as I said, doing the math on the first to the second half, I think you're at the bottom range just by doing it on a normalized basis. And then the fact we have opportunity of some improvement enables us to establish a range above that."

But when you look at what we've been able to do over the last few years is build backlog, which will lead to revenue. Now we've said in the past that these projects are bigger and longer in duration, which to me is a good story because that means it services us for many years after awards. So I think we're at the point where we're going to start to see, as we did this quarter, revenue increases and obviously the profitability that's there is going to follow that. So when you think about '17 is, I think, going to be still a reasonably difficult year just because of the lull that we experienced in new awards last year and the beginning of this year.

I still think we need some help from the legislative side of things in terms of funding and a comprehensive infrastructure plan. But one of the things I'm most pleased with is the balance of size of projects that we're going after. So obviously, you're going to have the big Purple Line kinds of projects, and that's kind of in our sweet spot. But I'm particularly pleased with the South Carolina Port project. It's about a $200 million project, which proves to us that we can be competitive at that level of project. Now when you look at the future, and particularly in the United States, you're going to see more $200 million projects than you're going to see $1.6 billion projects. So we've proven to ourself that we know how to be competitive on those smaller projects, and I think that's where the market is going to be. So if you get into '17, '18 -- obviously, you got to get past the election before really anything happens. But when you get into '17, '18, there's a litany of projects in that $200 million, $250 million range that's in our sights. Well, I'm expecting the infrastructure route to continue to grow, both in terms of the big projects because are the things we're going to always go after, but more importantly, the balance of that portfolio with the more moderate-sized programs.

But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2.
During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and our Form 10-K, which was filed back on February 18.
During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. On the call, we'll review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, and I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets that we serve. 
During the past 2 years, we've experienced sluggish growth in the global economy and especially weak growth in the industrial production. Commodity prices are volatile. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but many geopolitical events have created uncertainty, which have impacted the decision making of our customers. When you think about the -- there's been 20 ISIS attacks. There's -- in the last 12 months, you got Brexit, you got Paris, the climate change accord, TPP, et cetera, all leading to the stagnation of decisions that are being made. 
Generally speaking, we expect continued slow recovery in the global economy and modest improvement in the EC&M market specifically. However, with that negative note, we are seeing capital spending return. We expect customers to award projects at a moderate pace, as evidenced by our award of a bauxite project in the second quarter in mining and the award of the recently announced Tengiz project, which we'll book in the third quarter. 
Despite the challenges of the past 12 months, we've done an excellent job building our non-Energy, Chemicals & Mining portfolio. Said another way, our 3 noncommodity focus segments have backlog of over $22 billion. This represents a 92% increase over this time last year. 
We continue to focus on becoming a more competitive company. As an example, in addition to the $100 million in overhead that we took out of our business in 2014, we are targeting an additional $80 million this year. I firmly believe the size and diversity of our backlog positions us well for the future. 
Now let's look at the second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the second quarter were $102 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared with $149 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $230 million compared to $282 million a year ago. Improvements in our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by lower mining activity and forecast revisions on 2 projects in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. Consolidated segment profit margins were 4.7% compared to 5.5% last quarter and 5.9% a year ago. Segment margin for Energy, Chemicals & Mining was 5.1%. The effect of the 2 forecast revisions in this segment was 1.4%.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter and comparable with -- to the results of a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $6.4 billion. Consolidated backlog at the end was $47.3 billion, up 14% from $41.6 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $1.2 billion in new awards. This includes a $500 million award for a bauxite mine in Guinea, our first major mining award in over a year. Ending backlog was 27 -- sorry, $25 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
Looking ahead, we announced a few weeks ago that the Tengizchevroil has reached a final investment decision on the Tengiz oil expansion project in Kazakhstan. We're very proud to have been working at Tengiz since 1997, and I'm excited about this Fluor-led JV in supporting TCO in this next phase. We will be booking a multibillion-dollar award -- our portion of that award in the third quarter.
Second quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $3.4 billion and included the Purple Line Light Rail project in Maryland; South Carolina Port Access road in Charleston, South Carolina; and the Greensville combined cycle power plant in Virginia. We've been very pleased with the pace of new awards in an infrastructure with 4 significant project wins in the last 4 quarters: Bergstrom, the Loop 202 in Arizona, as well as the 2 I just mentioned. 
Ending backlog for this segment were $12.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of $1.2 billion. Including task orders for LOGCAP IV, their ending backlog was $5.8 billion, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $664 million. This includes a 5-year maintenance and alliance contract for 6 power plants for Southern Company, and their backlog was $3.7 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago.
Our integration of Stork continues to progress, and we are in the process of expanding Stork's capabilities to additional markets. However, Stork's contributions are more than offset by other declines, including our equipment business due to continued slowdown in mining and delays in construction activities, particularly in Mexico, South America and Mozambique. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, which compares to $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, MMAI and Government were offset by a decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. MMAI gains were largely attributable to the Stork acquisition. 
As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.72 reflect the impact of forecast provisions on 2 projects. The tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at just under 34%. For the remaining 2 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 33% to 35%, although we may have an opportunity to do better than that.
Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $53 million compared to $48 million a year ago. This increase is largely due to Stork integration costs. While spot commodity prices have improved somewhat, we continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our organization. To put this in perspective, in the second quarter, we incurred $16 million in restructuring costs at the corporate G&A level including Stork and another $7 million of restructuring expenses at the segment level.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion last quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $91 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $204 million for the same period last year. 
Last year had some unusual items, but this year, project working capital has grown. This increase was driven in part by normal project execution activities and the timing of billings on several projects, including delayed payments from our customers. While working capital may still have net growth for the full year, we expect it to decline from these levels. Timing always has a big impact. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $47.3 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog increased from 24% last quarter to 29% as a result of the Purple Line and Dominion Greensville awards and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 45% U.S and 55% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although we are pleased to see significant awards across our various end markets and the backlog positions us well for the long term, we continue to operate in an environment where customers continue with lower capital investment budgets and delayed final investment decisions. In addition, the backlog burn rate remains low whether by client direction or due to the size and complexity of the project. Having said all that, we would have been in a good position to maintain the previous guidance had it not been for the forecast provisions on the 2 projects. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing the upper end and narrowing its 2016 guidance range from $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share. The range has upside to our normalized run rate for the first half because we think that there are opportunities for one or more favorable items to hit in the second half.
Since we mentioned the Purple Line award earlier, you may have seen that it may be delayed for an additional study. These are projects which ramp up very slowly, really not at a high level activity for a couple of years, so this would not affect our 2016 guidance.
Our guidance for 2016 assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We anticipate margins for the remainder of the year in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the upper 5% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 4.5% to 5.5% range; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But as we've kind of signaled, there's going to be probably a pretty big quarter next quarter, which is on the back of TCO in that market. What's interesting right now in both mining and in oil and gas is we've seen over the last 2 years, with oil price being down, kind of pulling back, kind of reprioritizing their capital spend. And now they're to the point where they've got to do some things. I think mining, just pick on mining, I mean, I don't think anybody on this phone expected us to book a $500 million project in mining any time soon. And I would argue that, that's the first of several good awards, maybe not quite that size, but we're starting to see some things loosen up in specific commodities. So I think mining has hit the bottom, and it was a pretty low bottom, and we're starting to see some improvement in that market. When you look across the realm of Energy & Chemicals, the same phenomenon is happening. The good projects are still moving forward, evidenced by TCO. Chemicals are still continuing to look at new crackers. In fact, I believe you're going to see probably a new cracker complex per year go to FID over the next several years if you're in the United States. So I think that, all in all, we're going to start to see E&C kind of start to pick up -- pick back up based on what we're hearing from our customers and the things that we're bidding on. So I kind of feel like Energy & Chemicals kind of hit a low -- has hit a low point last quarter, this quarter, but I don't see that as the normal run rate going forward in the next year."

Second half versus first half, I mean, I wouldn't take the as-reported numbers for each of the first 2 quarters and treat them as a run rate. I'd go back to the first quarter, and I would take out the Stork transition costs and the legal matter that we recorded in the first quarter. And you'd add that back, and that’d get you in the mid-$0.80s range for the first quarter, around $0.85. And then if you normalize the second quarter for just the 2 projects, you're going to be up at $0.88 even if you don't address any of the restructuring cost. So then just take that $0.88 for the second quarter and assume that repeats itself, and you're at $1.76. So now you're pretty close to the bottom of the range from the as-reported standpoint for the first half plus taking the second quarter on a normalized basis and applying it to the next 2 quarters. So -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, the range we have considers that we're going to have some positive events, we believe, in the second half, which is more the norm for us to have positive events. We do record things fairly conservatively, and more often than not, we have project revisions that are an improvement over time as opposed to downward revision. So we don't expect more of those. We would expect more to have some improvements, and there's some areas, I'm not going to go through specifically. But I mentioned tax rate. There's some particular -- some upside with respect to as well. So we have some things that, we think, are going to help us in the second half. But as I said, doing the math on the first to the second half, I think you're at the bottom range just by doing it on a normalized basis. And then the fact we have opportunity of some improvement enables us to establish a range above that."

Now we've said in the past that these projects are bigger and longer in duration, which to me is a good story because that means it services us for many years after award. So I think we're at the point where we're going to start to see, as we did this quarter, revenue increases and obviously the profitability that's there is going to follow that.

I still think we need some help from the legislative side of things in terms of funding and a comprehensive infrastructure plan. But one of the things I'm most pleased with is the balance of size of projects that we're going after. So obviously, you're going to have the big Purple Line kinds of projects, and that's kind of in our sweet spot. But I'm particularly pleased with the South Carolina Port project. It's about a $200 million project, which proves to us that we can be competitive at that level of project. Now when you look at the future, particularly in the United States, you're going to see more $200 million projects than you're going to see $1.6 billion projects. So we've proven to ourself that we know how to be competitive on those smaller projects, and I think that's where the market is going to be. So if you get into '17, '18 -- obviously, you got to get past the election before really anything happens. But when you get into '17, '18, there's a litany of projects in that $200 million, $250 million range that's in our sights. Well, I'm expecting the infrastructure group to continue to grow, both in terms of the big projects because are things we're going to always go after, but more importantly, the balance of that portfolio with the more moderate-sized programs. So I'm really pleased with the changes that have been made there and kind of where we're headed."

But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2.
During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and our Form 10-K, which was filed back on February 18.
During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. On the call, we'll review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, and I want to start by spending a few minutes sharing our perspective on the markets that we serve. 
During the past 2 years, we've experienced sluggish growth in the global economy and especially weak growth in the industrial production. Commodity prices are volatile. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but many geopolitical events have created uncertainty, which have impacted the decision making of our customers. When you think about the -- there's been 20 ISIS attacks. There's -- in the last 12 months, you got Brexit, you got Paris, the climate change accord, TPP, et cetera, all leading to the stagnation of decisions that are being made. 
Generally speaking, we expect continued slow recovery in the global economy and modest improvement in the EC&M market specifically. However, with that negative note, we are seeing capital spending return. We expect customers to award projects at a moderate pace, as evidenced by our award of a bauxite project in the second quarter in mining and the award of the recently announced Tengiz project, which we'll book in the third quarter. 
Despite the challenges of the past 12 months, we've done an excellent job building our non-Energy, Chemicals & Mining portfolio. Said another way, our 3 noncommodity focus segments have backlog of over $22 billion. This represents a 92% increase over this time last year. 
We continue to focus on becoming a more competitive company. As an example, in addition to the $100 million in overhead that we took out of our business in 2014, we are targeting an additional $80 million this year. I firmly believe the size and diversity of our backlog positions us well for the future. 
Now let's look at the second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the second quarter were $102 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared with $149 million or $1 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $230 million compared to $282 million a year ago. Improvements in our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were offset by lower mining activity and forecast revisions on 2 projects in our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. Consolidated segment profit margins were 4.7% compared to 5.5% last quarter and 5.9% a year ago. Segment margin for Energy, Chemicals & Mining was 5.1%. The effect of the 2 forecast revisions in this segment was 1.4%.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter and comparable with -- to the results of a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $6.4 billion. Consolidated backlog at the end was $47.3 billion, up 14% from $41.6 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $1.2 billion in new awards. This includes a $500 million award for a bauxite mine in Guinea, our first major mining award in over a year. Ending backlog was 27 -- sorry, $25 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
Looking ahead, we announced a few weeks ago that the Tengizchevroil has reached a final investment decision on the Tengiz oil expansion project in Kazakhstan. We're very proud to have been working at Tengiz since 1997, and I'm excited about this Fluor-led JV in supporting TCO in this next phase. We will be booking a multibillion-dollar award -- our portion of that award in the third quarter.
Second quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $3.4 billion and included the Purple Line Light Rail project in Maryland; South Carolina Port Access road in Charleston, South Carolina; and the Greensville combined cycle power plant in Virginia. We've been very pleased with the pace of new awards in an infrastructure with 4 significant project wins in the last 4 quarters: Bergstrom, the Loop 202 in Arizona, as well as the 2 I just mentioned. 
Ending backlog for this segment were $12.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of $1.2 billion. Including task orders for LOGCAP IV, their ending backlog was $5.8 billion, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. 
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $664 million. This includes a 5-year maintenance and alliance contract for 6 power plants for Southern Company, and their backlog was $3.7 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago.
Our integration of Stork continues to progress, and we are in the process of expanding Stork's capabilities to additional markets. However, Stork's contributions are more than offset by other declines, including our equipment business due to continued slowdown in mining and delays in construction activities, particularly in Mexico, South America and Mozambique. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

I'll start by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, which compares to $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, MMAI and Government were offset by a decline in mining activity within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. MMAI gains were largely attributable to the Stork acquisition. 
As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.72 reflect the impact of forecast provisions on 2 projects. The tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at just under 34%. For the remaining 2 quarters, we expect the tax rate will be 33% to 35%, although we may have an opportunity to do better than that.
Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $53 million compared to $48 million a year ago. This increase is largely due to Stork integration costs. While spot commodity prices have improved somewhat, we continue to be diligent on taking costs out of our organization. To put this in perspective, in the second quarter, we incurred $16 million in restructuring costs at the corporate G&A level including Stork and another $7 million of restructuring expenses at the segment level.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion last quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $91 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $204 million for the same period last year. 
Last year had some unusual items, but this year, project working capital has grown. This increase was driven in part by normal project execution activities and the timing of billings on several projects, including delayed payments from our customers. While working capital may still have net growth for the full year, we expect it to decline from these levels. Timing always has a big impact. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $47.3 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog increased from 24% last quarter to 29% as a result of the Purple Line and Dominion Greensville awards and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 45% U.S and 55% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on Slide 8. Although we are pleased to see significant awards across our various end markets and the backlog positions us well for the long term, we continue to operate in an environment where customers continue with lower capital investment budgets and delayed final investment decisions. In addition, the backlog burn rate remains low whether by client direction or due to the size and complexity of the project. Having said all that, we would have been in a good position to maintain the previous guidance had it not been for the forecast provisions on the 2 projects. Taking this into consideration, the company is reducing the upper end and narrowing its 2016 guidance range from $3.25 to $3.65 per diluted share to $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share. The range has upside to our normalized run rate for the first half because we think that there are opportunities for one or more favorable items to hit in the second half.
Since we mentioned the Purple Line award earlier, you may have seen that it may be delayed for an additional study. These are projects which ramp up very slowly, really not at a high level activity for a couple of years, so this would not affect our 2016 guidance.
Our guidance for 2016 assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We anticipate margins for the remainder of the year in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the upper 5% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 4.5% to 5.5% range; and Government to be approximately 3%. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But as we've kind of signaled, there's going to be probably a pretty big quarter next quarter, which is on the back of TCO in that market. What's interesting right now in both mining and in oil and gas is we've seen over the last 2 years, with oil price being down, kind of pulling back, kind of reprioritizing their capital spend. And now they're to the point where they've got to do some things. I think mining, just pick on mining, I mean, I don't think anybody on this phone expected us to book a $500 million project in mining anytime soon. And I would argue that, that's the first of several good awards, maybe not quite that size, but we're starting to see some things loosen up in specific commodities. So I think mining has hit the bottom, and it was a pretty low bottom, and we're starting to see some improvement in that market. When you look across the realm of Energy & Chemicals, the same phenomenon is happening. The good projects are still moving forward, evidenced by TCO. Chemicals are still continuing to look at new crackers. In fact, I believe you're going to see probably a new cracker complex per year go to FID over the next several years if you're in the United States. So I think that, all in all, we're going to start to see E&C kind of start to pick up -- pick back up based on what we're hearing from our customers and the things that we're bidding on. So I kind of feel like Energy & Chemicals kind of hit a low -- has hit a low point last quarter, this quarter, but I don't see that as the normal run rate going forward in the next year."

Second half versus first half, I mean, I wouldn't take the as-reported numbers for each of the first 2 quarters and treat them as a run rate. I'd go back to the first quarter, and I would take out the Stork transition costs and the legal matter that we recorded in the first quarter. And you'd add that back, and that’d get you in the mid-$0.80s range for the first quarter, around $0.85. And then if you normalize the second quarter for just the 2 projects, you're going to be up at $0.88 even if you don't address any of the restructuring cost. So then just take that $0.88 for the second quarter and assume that repeats itself, and you're at $1.76. So now you're pretty close to the bottom of the range from the as-reported standpoint for the first half plus taking the second quarter on a normalized basis and applying it to the next 2 quarters. So -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, the range we have considers that we're going to have some positive events, we believe, in the second half, which is more the norm for us to have positive events. We do record things fairly conservatively, and more often than not, we have project revisions that are an improvement over time as opposed to downward revision. So we don't expect more of those. We would expect more to have some improvements, and there's some areas, I'm not going to go through specifically. But I mentioned tax rate. There's some particular -- some upside with respect to as well. So we have some things that, we think, are going to help us in the second half. But as I said, doing the math on the first to the second half, I think you're at the bottom range just by doing it on a normalized basis. And then the fact we have opportunity of some improvement enables us to establish a range above that."

Now we've said in the past that these projects are bigger and longer in duration, which to me is a good story because that means it services us for many years after award. So I think we're at the point where we're going to start to see, as we did this quarter, revenue increases and obviously the profitability that's there is going to follow that.

I still think we need some help from the legislative side of things in terms of funding and a comprehensive infrastructure plan. But one of the things I'm most pleased with is the balance of size of projects that we're going after. So obviously, you're going to have the big Purple Line kinds of projects, and that's kind of in our sweet spot. But I'm particularly pleased with the South Carolina Port project. It's about a $200 million project, which proves to us that we can be competitive at that level of project. Now when you look at the future, particularly in the United States, you're going to see more $200 million projects than you're going to see $1.6 billion projects. So we've proven to ourself that we know how to be competitive on those smaller projects, and I think that's where the market is going to be. So if you get into '17, '18 -- obviously, you got to get past the election before really anything happens. But when you get into '17, '18, there's a litany of projects in that $200 million, $250 million range that's in our sights. Well, I'm expecting the infrastructure group to continue to grow, both in terms of the big projects because are things we're going to always go after, but more importantly, the balance of that portfolio with the more moderate-sized programs. So I'm really pleased with the changes that have been made there and kind of where we're headed."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this",1055,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this quarter. In the second quarter, a revision was made to the project forecast to recognize the impact of several heavy rain events and abnormal site flooding. This situation has created an out-of-sequence work schedule, which continues to have a negative impact on productivity to this day. However, it was during the third quarter that the lack of productivity led to an updated detailed review, the result being our charge for the third quarter, which is related to additional craft hours and indirect costs required to complete the above ground portion of the project. This charge takes into consideration the out-of-sequence schedule and the current levels of productivity. These additional hours became apparent in the third quarter with the increased rate of pipe direction in the process units, which was not proceeding at the expected production rate.
All of this is evidence of what can happen with complex stick built projects -- construction projects when faced with unusual weather conditions and other site disruptions. To answer one of the questions you are likely to have, there are always risk in our business, but these circumstances are currently not evident on any of our other projects. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter results beginning with Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the third quarter were $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared with $176 million or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago. 
Consolidated segment profits for the quarter was $25 million compared to $240 million a year ago. Results for the quarter include improved performance results from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment. Consolidated profit margins were 0.05% compared to 5.5% a year ago. The effect of the charge in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment was 4.8%. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. 
New awards for the quarter were $7 billion. In fact, new awards are up 29% through the first 9 months compared to last year. Consolidated Fluor backlog at the end was $44.3 billion, up from $41.7 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $5.6 billion in new awards. This includes an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion program at Kazakhstan. And we're proud to have been working at the Tengiz site for just under 20 years, and I'm pleased to see our customer moving forward with high-value projects during this expansion.
During the quarter, we received notice that the contract for one of our LNG EPC projects we have had in backlog has been suspended. We have made an adjustment to backlog to remove the EPC portion of this project. We also removed some smaller projects, which have been similarly suspended. As a result, we expect to see a faster conversion of our backlog.Backlog in Energy & Chemicals for the quarter was $23.7 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago. 
In Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, we continue to see positive trends in revenue as we progressed through 2 nuclear projects for Westinghouse and as infrastructure projects start to ramp up. Ending backlog for this segment was $11.5 billion, up from $5.1 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of just under $1 billion. Awards for the quarter include the additional funding on Department of Energy's Savannah River project. Ending backlog was $5.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year ago.
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $350 million. This includes operations and maintenance work in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. Ending backlog was $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago.
Now that we've covered the quarter, I would like to take a moment to share our perspectives on the markets we serve and what we are doing to strengthen our performance and competitiveness. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, overall global economic growth has underperformed our expectations. We continue to experience greater-than-anticipated headwinds from the commodities in related markets, which impact our Energy, Chemicals & Mining and Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segments.
On a more positive note, we've seen significant increase in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power new awards and backlog, which should contribute to our growth next year. Looking forward, we do expect a modest improvement in the economic growth next year, which should lead to greater consumer spending and growth in industrial production. We expect these increases in economic activity will lead to greater project opportunities for Fluor.
We do believe that in order to maintain supply-demand balances of key commodities like crude oil and copper, our customers will need to move forward with major capital projects, but it will be gradual. We also expect infrastructure and government spending to continue.
As we move into 2017, I remain concerned that this longer -- lower for longer mindset on the commodity prices is starting to distort the E&C contracting market. We're now seeing customers not only expecting lower prices without addressing capital efficiencies but also demanding contractors take on risk that is in some cases outside of the contractor's control. This, along with an increased level of irrational bidding and fee pricing, creates an unusual and challenging marketplace. But we've seen this cycle before.
Having said all that, it's imperative that we maintain the discipline in our approach to pricing and risk management. That means not only seeking the right clients but the right projects with the right clients. It means making sure we appropriately price for risk, advise our clients on the benefits of an integrated solutions approach, and when we win the contract, intensely focus on execution and project completion.
Finally, we are prepared to deal with this lower for longer attitude. This includes controlling our own cost structure, reserving our sound capital structure and demonstrating the value of our integrated solutions approach.
With that, I'll now talk -- turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"
655659,403988297,1072992,"Fluor Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Fluor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, whi",574,"Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, which compares to $4.4 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity and Government were offset by a decline in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.03 reflect the impact of a charge for a petrochemical facility in the United States. If you add back $1.10 to our results, it's obviously, otherwise, a strong quarter. Although obscured by the large charge, there were offsetting favorable profit pickups, which positively affected ECM margins and consolidated results.
Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $27 million compared to $35 million a year ago. The quarter benefited from lower compensation expense as a result of the charge and from a foreign exchange gain. While there were no significant restructuring expenses at the corporate level this quarter, we remain focused on reducing overhead costs throughout the organization.
Taxes in the quarter benefited from the favorable resolution of an IRS audit and an increase in R&D tax credits. We've been successful in capturing these types of tax benefits on a regular basis, and we'll continue to focus on doing so in the future.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion last quarter and $2.3 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $316 million for the quarter and $452 million year-to-date. While working capital has increased since the beginning of the year, we saw improvements this quarter as we expected. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $44.3 billion. A percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 29%. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 47% U.S. and 53% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016 and 2017, which is on Slide 8. To start with, if we're spending a minute summarizing what drove Q3's results, which were strong if you eliminate the big charge. This was driven by lower G&A, favorable taxes, foreign exchange benefits and favorable profit adjustments in Energy, Chemicals & Mining aside from the big charge. These favorable items were, in the aggregate, worth over $0.30 of EPS.
As a result of the project charge in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we're reducing our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share from $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. The range includes opportunities with respect to tax and other upsides related to contractual matters. For 2017, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share.
Our range for 2017 assumes continued challenges in our commodity-focused segment and a shift in mix from higher-margin engineering to procurement and construction activities, offset by increasing opportunities in infrastructure, industrial and government. Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately 227 -- excuse me, $200 million to $275 million depending upon AMECO opportunities and NuScale expenses approximately $80 million.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

If we -- it implies a step-down in earnings, earnings of about $0.75 per quarter, where as if we looked at where you were run rating in 2016, it was more like $0.90 a quarter. We have TCO. You have Westinghouse. You have the infrastructure projects. You have onetime restructuring and integration costs that go away. It's just your '17 guidance doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Because it's exclusively in the construction phase, mostly of the issue is relative to piping productivity. When you look at the degree of difficulty of the design, the weather events and everything else, it took us out of sequence. And everybody that's been in this business knows when you get out of sequence, the costs go up. And that's what we've seen here. As I said, the -- in the second quarter, we had a review. But we had not really guided into the piping scope on the ISBL or the inside battery limits. That's what we really started in the third quarter. And when we saw where we were, but more importantly, where -- what it was going to take to get finished is what resulted in the additional craft hours, supervision, indirect materials and the like. We sit at about 60% complete in construction. The project is scheduled to be mechanically complete in late summer or early fall of next year. So we're within a year of completion based on the delayed schedule that we had because of the weather events. So I feel like with -- we took a really hard look at this, almost a conservative look at this because of what we knew we had to get done. I will mention that this project was bid prior to some of the changes that we've made and some of the innovations that we've applied in the integrated solutions model. So when you look at where we're going, we shouldn't have these kind of issues in our backlog or in the projects that we win. So I think we're at a place where we've got our hands around what it's going to take. I'm extremely disappointed, as I said in the release, in where we are. But I feel comfortable that going forward, these types of things will be less of an issue. When you look at '17, I would argue -- I would say it's just in a couple of places. One is there's been a delay in the award of some of the projects even with the TCO project. So it's a book and burn issue that drives us to look at the number we presented. The other issue is I think the competition is extremely tight. And we're probably maybe a little bit more conservative in terms of the win rate that we look to get because we are going to maintain that discipline in terms of risk and pricing. We've got -- when you look at the other businesses though, I think we see good growth opportunities. But they're just not big enough to fill the void of some of the larger programs and projects that are there. So we've taken a bit of a conservative view at next year."

There's the charge and then there's the positives from the other things described, including the expense reduction, which affects ECM as well as other parts of the company. There's foreign exchange in there and there was project performance. If you adjust ECM for all of those things in the third quarter, it'd be just over 6% margin at the EBIT level. We expect the fourth quarter to be between 5% and 6%. And then we'll talk about all the segments, including ECM more by the time we get to the year-end conference call, next February."

And as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we have a very specific key account process that we have where we focus on the customers that we have the best chance of being successful with, in terms of delivering those projects and delivering the profitability that we expect. There's some short-term behaviors that will challenge that. But I think in past cycles, we've been able to say no politely on certain things. And in some cases, change the opinions of our customers in terms of what risk they're expecting us to take that we have no ability to control. So as I said, this is the first time we've seen this behavior both on our customers side and on our customer sides. But I think we're going to maintain that discipline. And I think that's where our diversity is part of the answer for continuing to grow. We were able to escape to where the put's going to be and not have to rely on going back to a previous question, not rely on a must-win project. We're going to maintain our discipline. I think that even the CPChem project went through a pretty rigorous circumstance. But we had some uncontrollable events that have led us into a situation that would have been bad anyway. But I think we could've done a better job in terms of mitigating some of those risk earlier, but it was still a bad project. But the fact of the matter is, we're going to maintain our discipline and we're going to protect the company just like we have in past cycles that looked just like the cycle. Now I would like to point out the lower for longer piece. When you think about our oil and gas customers as well as our mining customers, I think they've got in their head around the fact that the commodity prices are going to maintain the current levels for a long, long time. And they have in fact, changed their business model to deal with a lower-for-longer oil prices for example. So when you look at what's out there, they're prioritizing those projects, you can argue they've taken a longer deep breath here not having the confidence that the oil prices are going to moderate. And therefore, that pushes the -- even the high-quality projects out in time. And that's what we're experiencing now. I would also say that the conversations we're having with our customers is, they've gotten comfortable with their new model. They've gotten comfortable with their new prices, and they're starting to move forward with projects that are critical in terms of their growth trajectory. So we're seeing many, many of these customers moving these projects towards FID as we get through next year into '18, '19, '20. So where lower for longer can be seen as a negative, I actually see it as a positive. Because we're seeing much better behavior from customers in terms of the priorities that they're doing. And these high-value projects are typically the most critical and most complicated projects, which I think feeds right into our value proposition with those customers and what those customers expect us to deliver. So I kind of denoted a little bit of negativity in the way that you used the term -- the phrase, lower for longer. But in fact, I actually see that as an opportunity now."

I think, if you think about the Kuwaitis right now, those 2 big projects that we have out there, you can argue we're done -- were bid in a countercyclical time. But in fact, if the Kuwaitis don't move forward on the fourth refinery like they've done and in our success, they would end up being that importers in the motor fuel to the future.

Those that cannot and don't want to do the change, if they're good key customers and the risk profile is right and it matches with our discipline, we'll build a stick built for them, but they won't enjoy the benefits of some of the learnings that we've had. So like I said, this isn't the first time I've seen this. We're going to maintain our discipline. And I know some folks will do some silly things and maybe in a few years, they'll regret that, but it is what it is. But we've proven over time that, that we can compete. It hasn't been that long ago where some people that were asking these questions on the phone, said we can no longer compete against the Koreans. We proved that to be an incorrect statement. And we'll continue to do what Fluor does and continue to grow this company and improve our offering to our customers."

One, it's not lowering our prices. It's lowering our cost that we're going to focus on. As I said, this has happened before and there are certain places around the world where the procurement process is such that they can't look past low price. They have to look at -- they can't look at value. So I'll give you an example where the typical project in the process industries, a FEED is typically between 1% to 2%, depending on difficulty of process of TIC for the cost of the FEED. We're seeing some of our competitors bidding in less than 0.5% [ph] of TIC for the FEED. Now you can argue that, that's not producing or delivering the same level of information or data to make the decision on the EPC. So I would argue that just as a service to the customer eventually, because if you don't have a complete FEED, you're not going to have a solid EPC bid. And you'll the see change or gameplay and we're just not going to go down that road. Now like I said, I'm confident in the new award plan that we have embedded in our over all '17 plan and outlook.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this",1056,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this quarter. In the second quarter, a revision was made to the project forecast to recognize the impact of several heavy rain events and abnormal site flooding. This situation has created an out-of-sequence work schedule, which continues to have a negative impact on productivity to this day. However, it was during the third quarter that the lack of productivity led to an updated detailed review, the result being our charge for the third quarter, which is related to additional craft hours and indirect costs required to complete the above ground portion of the project. This charge takes into consideration the out-of-sequence schedule and the current levels of productivity. These additional hours became apparent in the third quarter with the increased rate of pipe erection in the process units, which was not proceeding at the expected production rate.
All of this is evidence of what can happen with complex stick built projects -- construction projects when faced with unusual weather conditions and other site disruptions. To answer one of the questions you are likely to have, there are always risk in our business, but these circumstances are currently not evident on any of our other projects.
Now let's turn to the third quarter results beginning with Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the third quarter were $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared with $176 million or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated segment profits for the quarter was $25 million compared to $240 million a year ago. Results for the quarter include improved performance results from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment. Consolidated profit margins were 0.05% compared to 5.5% a year ago. The effect of the charge in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment was 4.8%. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
New awards for the quarter were $7 billion. In fact, new awards are up 29% through the first 9 months compared to last year. Consolidated Fluor backlog at the end was $44.3 billion, up from $41.7 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $5.6 billion in new awards. This includes an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion program in Kazakhstan. And we're proud to have been working at the Tengiz site for just under 20 years, and I'm pleased to see our customer moving forward with high-value projects during this expansion.
During the quarter, we received notice that the contract for one of our LNG EPC projects we have had in backlog has been suspended. We have made an adjustment to backlog to remove the EPC portion of this project. We also removed some smaller projects, which have been similarly suspended. As a result, we expect to see a faster conversion of our backlog. Backlog in Energy & Chemicals for the quarter was $23.7 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
In Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, we continue to see positive trends in revenue as we progressed through 2 nuclear projects for Westinghouse and as infrastructure projects start to ramp up. Ending backlog for this segment was $11.5 billion, up from $5.1 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of just under $1 billion. Awards for the quarter include the additional funding on Department of Energy's Savannah River project. Ending backlog was $5.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year ago.
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $350 million. This includes operations and maintenance work in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. Ending backlog was $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago.
Now that we've covered the quarter, I would like to take a moment to share our perspectives on the markets we serve and what we are doing to strengthen our performance and competitiveness. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, overall global economic growth has underperformed our expectations. We continue to experience greater-than-anticipated headwinds from the commodities in related markets, which impact our Energy, Chemicals & Mining and Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segments.
On a more positive note, we've seen significant increase in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power new awards and backlog, which should contribute to our growth next year. Looking forward, we do expect a modest improvement in the economic growth next year, which should lead to greater consumer spending and growth in industrial production. We expect these increases in economic activity will lead to greater project opportunities for Fluor.
We do believe that in order to maintain supply-demand balances of key commodities like crude oil and copper, our customers will need to move forward with major capital projects, but it will be gradual. We also expect infrastructure and government spending to continue.
As we move into 2017, I remain concerned that this longer -- lower for longer mindset on the commodity prices is starting to distort the E&C contracting market. We're now seeing customers not only expecting lower prices without addressing capital efficiencies but also demanding contractors take on risk that is in some cases outside of the contractor's control. This, along with an increased level of irrational bidding and fee pricing, creates an unusual and challenging marketplace. But we've seen this cycle before.
Having said all that, it's imperative that we maintain the discipline in our approach to pricing and risk management. That means not only seeking the right clients but the right projects with the right clients. It means making sure we appropriately price for risk, advise our clients on the benefits of an integrated solutions approach, and when we win the contract, intensely focus on execution and project completion.
Finally, we are prepared to deal with this lower for longer attitude. This includes controlling our own cost structure, reserving our sound capital structure and demonstrating the value of our integrated solutions approach.
With that, I'll now talk -- turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity and Government were offset by a decline in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.03 reflect the impact of a charge for a petrochemical facility in the United States. If you add back $1.10 to our results, it's obviously, otherwise, a strong quarter. Although obscured by the large charge, there were offsetting favorable profit pickups, which positively affected ECM margins and consolidated results.
Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $27 million compared to $35 million a year ago. The quarter benefited from lower compensation expense as a result of the charge and from a foreign exchange gain. While there were no significant restructuring expenses at the corporate level this quarter, we remain focused on reducing overhead costs throughout the organization.
Taxes in the quarter benefited from the favorable resolution of an IRS audit and an increase in R&D tax credits. We've been successful in capturing these types of tax benefits on a regular basis, and we'll continue to focus on doing so in the future.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion last quarter and $2.3 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $316 million for the quarter and $452 million year-to-date. While working capital has increased since the beginning of the year, we saw improvements this quarter as we expected. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $44.3 billion. A percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 29%. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 47% U.S. and 53% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016 and 2017, which is on Slide 8. To start with, it's worth spending a minute summarizing what drove Q3's results, which were strong if you eliminate the big charge. This was driven by lower G&A, favorable taxes, foreign exchange benefits and favorable profit adjustments in Energy, Chemicals & Mining aside from the big charge. These favorable items were, in the aggregate, worth over $0.30 of EPS.
As a result of the project charge in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we're reducing our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share from $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. The range includes opportunities with respect to tax and other upsides related to contractual matters. For 2017, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share.
Our range for 2017 assumes continued challenges in our commodity-focused segment and a shift in mix from higher-margin engineering to procurement and construction activities, offset by increasing opportunities in infrastructure, industrial and government. Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately 227 -- excuse me, $200 million to $275 million depending upon AMECO opportunities and NuScale expenses of approximately $80 million.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Can you just provide us an update of what percent complete you are relative to where we were last quarter and the scope left on the project that is left to be complete and potential for any recovery longer term? And then I guess the other question I have is I'm a little perplexed by your 2017 guidance. If we -- it implies a step-down in earnings, earnings of about $0.75 per quarter, whereas if we looked at where you were run rating in 2016, it was more like $0.90 a quarter. We have TCO. You have Westinghouse. You have the infrastructure projects. You have onetime restructuring and integration costs that go away. It's just your '17 guidance doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So any color you can provide on that would be helpful."

Because it's exclusively in the construction phase, mostly of the issue is relative to piping productivity. When you look at the degree of difficulty of the design, the weather events and everything else, it took us out of sequence. And everybody that's been in this business knows when you get out of sequence, the costs go up. And that's what we've seen here. As I said, the -- in the second quarter, we had a review. But we had not really guided into the piping scope on the ISBL or the inside battery limits. That's what we really started in the third quarter. And when we saw where we were, but more importantly, where -- what it was going to take to get finished is what resulted in the additional craft hours, supervision, indirect materials and the like. We sit at about 60% complete in construction. The project is scheduled to be mechanically complete in late summer or early fall of next year. So we're within a year of completion based on the delayed schedule that we had because of the weather events. So I feel like with -- we took a really hard look at this, almost a conservative look at this because of what we knew we had to get done. I will mention that this project was bid prior to some of the changes that we've made and some of the innovations that we've applied in the integrated solutions model. So when you look at where we're going, we shouldn't have these kind of issues in our backlog or in the projects that we win. So I think we're at a place where we've got our hands around what it's going to take. I'm extremely disappointed, as I said in the release, in where we are. But I feel comfortable that going forward, these types of things will be less of an issue. When you look at '17, I would argue -- I would say it's just in a couple of places. One is there's been a delay in the award of some of the projects even with the TCO project. So it's a book and burn issue that drives us to look at the number we presented. The other issue is I think the competition is extremely tight. And we're probably maybe a little bit more conservative in terms of the win rate that we look to get because we are going to maintain that discipline in terms of risk and pricing. We've got -- when you look at the other businesses though, I think we see good growth opportunities. But they're just not big enough to fill the void of some of the larger programs and projects that are there. So we've taken a bit of a conservative view at next year."

But if you just look at Q3 results, the $0.03 of income, and you add back the CPChem charge and you back out what I indicated worth $0.30 or more of positives and then you analyze that, you can get around $3.30 on an annual basis. And then you factor that for the things that David described and the mix issues, and you're then looking at the range that we've given."

But as we said before on ECM, we do expect segment margins to go down. They were -- if you look at third quarter here, there's obviously a -- quite a bit of noise in there. There's the charge and then there's the positives from the other things described, including the comp expense reduction, which affects ECM as well as other parts of the company. There's foreign exchange in there and there was favorable project performance. If you adjust ECM for all of those things in the third quarter, it'd be just over 6% margin at the EBIT level. We expect the fourth quarter to be between 5% and 6%. And then we'll talk about all the segments, including ECM, a little bit more by the time we get to the year-end conference call next February."

And as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we have a very specific key account process that we have where we focus on the customers that we have the best chance of being able to be successful with in terms of delivering those projects and delivering the profitability that we expect. There's some short-term behaviors that will challenge that. But I think in past cycles, we've been able to say no politely on certain things, and in some cases, change the opinions of our customers in terms of what risk they're expecting us to take that we have no ability to control. So as I said, this isn't the first time we've seen this behavior both on our customers' sides and on our customers' sides. But I think we're going to maintain that discipline. And I think that's where our diversity is part of the answer for continuing to grow. We were able to skate to where the puck's going to be and not have to rely on -- going back to a previous question, not rely on a must-win project. We're going to maintain our discipline. I think that even the CPChem project went through a pretty rigorous circumstance. But we had some uncontrollable events that have led us into a situation that would have been bad anyway. But I think we could have done a better job in terms of mitigating some of those risks earlier, but it was still a bad project. But the fact of the matter is we're going to maintain our discipline and we're going to protect the company just like we have in past cycles that looked just like this cycle. Now I would like to comment on the lower for longer piece. When you think about our oil and gas customers as well as our mining customers, I think they've gotten their head around the fact that the commodity prices are going to be maintained at the current levels for a long, long time. And they have, in fact, changed their business model to deal with a lower for longer oil price as an example. So when you look at what's out there, they're prioritizing those projects. You can argue they've taken a longer deep breath here, not having the confidence that the oil prices were going to moderate. And therefore, that pushes the -- even the high-quality projects out in time. And that's what we're experiencing now. I would also say that the conversations we're having with our customers is they've gotten comfortable with their new model. They've gotten comfortable with the lower prices, and they're starting to move forward with the projects that are critical in terms of their growth trajectory. So we're seeing many, many of these customers moving these projects towards FID as we get through next year into '18, '19, '20. So where lower for longer can be seen as a negative, I actually see it as a positive because we're seeing much better behavior from customers in terms of the priorities that they're doing. And these high-value projects are typically the most critical and most complicated projects, which I think feeds right into our value proposition with those customers and what those customers expect us to deliver. So I kind of denoted a little bit of negativity in the way you used the term -- the phrase lower for longer. But in fact, I actually see that as an opportunity now."

We're still looking at low GDP growth globally and some of the same statistics that you guys are using in terms of overall growth. I think the countercyclical piece to this -- and I'll let Biggs talk about the burn. The countercyclical piece to this is they've waited so long that they have to do some of these projects. Many of these companies rely on reserve basis and other statistics in terms of their product production rates that they just won't simply be able to make if they don't make some of the improvements that are out in front of us. I think if you think about the Kuwaitis right now, those 2 big projects that we have out there, you can argue were done -- were bid in a countercyclical time. But in fact, if the Kuwaitis don't move forward on the fourth refinery like they've done and are a success, they would end up being net importers for motor fuels in the future. So there's things like that, that are going to drive decisions that may seem countercyclical to the statistical representation of GDP growth or market performance."

So I'll give you an example where a typical project in the process industries, a FEED is typically between 1% to 2% depending on difficulty of process of TIC for the cost of the FEED. We're seeing some of our competitors bidding in less than 0.5% of TIC for the FEED. Now you can argue that, that's not producing or delivering the same level of information or data to make the decision on the EPC. So I would argue that is a disservice to the customer eventually because if you don't have a complete FEED, you're not going to have a solid EPC bid. And you'll the see change or a gameplay and we're just not going to go down that road. Now like I said, I'm confident in the new award plan that we have embedded in our overall '17 plan and outlook. So that means that based on -- using your term of -- is it 30%? Well, no. We're fine. We've got the projects that meet our criteria to go chase. And we're going to maintain that discipline and go after those projects, which means we're probably not going to go for some of the projects that are taking this price mentality to what I think is a dangerous, dangerous game in terms of long-term capital efficiency. So not quite the answer you wanted to hear, but I feel pretty good about where we are."

And I think that what they've done is they've gone through their prioritization process and redone their models at lower for longer commodity prices. And I'm starting to see the confidence come back in terms of moving some of these things forward. You -- if you stay on the oil and gas guys, you've seen all the impairment taken care of with lower oil price. You're seeing the oil companies kind of bottoming out in terms of their profitability. And we're starting to see, I think, some confidence in moving some of these capital programs further -- or forward. I think when you look at power, we're starting to see some opportunities in power come back. And you've seen us take some limited notice to proceed projects in this year that obviously are scheduled to hit final notice to proceed during '17. I talked at length about infrastructure and where I see that going. Our pharmaceutical, biotech and advanced manufacturing group, the drugs that have been approved by the FDA is significantly higher than its bid in the last decade. And so we're seeing growth opportunities in that business. And again, I think the overlay to that is what we've done to try to lower our cost of service, our cost to deliver these capital to answer the bell of our customers around capital efficiency. So when you put all of that together with an overlay of solid annuity-type programs in the government world, in the asset management and integrity business, I think that we're starting to build again that confidence in our ability to deliver in '18, '19. So I think long answer, but I think we've already gotten to where confidence is returning, and some of these projects are moving forward to FID within our customer organizations."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this",1056,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this quarter. In the second quarter, a revision was made to the project forecast to recognize the impact of several heavy rain events and abnormal site flooding. This situation has created an out-of-sequence work schedule, which continues to have a negative impact on productivity to this day. However, it was during the third quarter that the lack of productivity led to an updated detailed review, the result being our charge for the third quarter, which is related to additional craft hours and indirect costs required to complete the above ground portion of the project. This charge takes into consideration the out-of-sequence schedule and the current levels of productivity. These additional hours became apparent in the third quarter with the increased rate of pipe erection in the process units, which was not proceeding at the expected production rate.
All of this is evidence of what can happen with complex stick built projects -- construction projects when faced with unusual weather conditions and other site disruptions. To answer one of the questions you are likely to have, there are always risk in our business, but these circumstances are currently not evident on any of our other projects.
Now let's turn to the third quarter results beginning with Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the third quarter were $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared with $176 million or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated segment profits for the quarter was $25 million compared to $240 million a year ago. Results for the quarter include improved performance results from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment. Consolidated profit margins were 0.05% compared to 5.5% a year ago. The effect of the charge in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment was 4.8%. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
New awards for the quarter were $7 billion. In fact, new awards are up 29% through the first 9 months compared to last year. Consolidated Fluor backlog at the end was $44.3 billion, up from $41.7 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $5.6 billion in new awards. This includes an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion program in Kazakhstan. And we're proud to have been working at the Tengiz site for just under 20 years, and I'm pleased to see our customer moving forward with high-value projects during this expansion.
During the quarter, we received notice that the contract for one of our LNG EPC projects we have had in backlog has been suspended. We have made an adjustment to backlog to remove the EPC portion of this project. We also removed some smaller projects, which have been similarly suspended. As a result, we expect to see a faster conversion of our backlog. Backlog in Energy & Chemicals for the quarter was $23.7 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
In Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, we continue to see positive trends in revenue as we progressed through 2 nuclear projects for Westinghouse and as infrastructure projects start to ramp up. Ending backlog for this segment was $11.5 billion, up from $5.1 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of just under $1 billion. Awards for the quarter include the additional funding on Department of Energy's Savannah River project. Ending backlog was $5.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year ago.
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $350 million. This includes operations and maintenance work in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. Ending backlog was $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago.
Now that we've covered the quarter, I would like to take a moment to share our perspectives on the markets we serve and what we are doing to strengthen our performance and competitiveness. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, overall global economic growth has underperformed our expectations. We continue to experience greater-than-anticipated headwinds from the commodities in related markets, which impact our Energy, Chemicals & Mining and Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segments.
On a more positive note, we've seen significant increase in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power new awards and backlog, which should contribute to our growth next year. Looking forward, we do expect a modest improvement in the economic growth next year, which should lead to greater consumer spending and growth in industrial production. We expect these increases in economic activity will lead to greater project opportunities for Fluor.
We do believe that in order to maintain supply-demand balances of key commodities like crude oil and copper, our customers will need to move forward with major capital projects, but it will be gradual. We also expect infrastructure and government spending to continue.
As we move into 2017, I remain concerned that this longer -- lower for longer mindset on the commodity prices is starting to distort the E&C contracting market. We're now seeing customers not only expecting lower prices without addressing capital efficiencies but also demanding contractors take on risk that is in some cases outside of the contractor's control. This, along with an increased level of irrational bidding and fee pricing, creates an unusual and challenging marketplace. But we've seen this cycle before.
Having said all that, it's imperative that we maintain the discipline in our approach to pricing and risk management. That means not only seeking the right clients but the right projects with the right clients. It means making sure we appropriately price for risk, advise our clients on the benefits of an integrated solutions approach, and when we win the contract, intensely focus on execution and project completion.
Finally, we are prepared to deal with this lower for longer attitude. This includes controlling our own cost structure, preserving our sound capital structure and demonstrating the value of our integrated solutions approach.
With that, I'll now talk -- turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"
655659,403988297,1073377,"Fluor Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Fluor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, whi",575,"Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, which compares to $4.4 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity and Government were offset by a decline in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.03 reflect the impact of a charge for a petrochemical facility in the United States. If you add back $1.10 to our results, it's obviously, otherwise, a strong quarter. Although obscured by the large charge, there were offsetting favorable profit pickups, which positively affected ECM margins and consolidated results.
Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $27 million compared to $35 million a year ago. The quarter benefited from lower compensation expense as a result of the charge and from a foreign exchange gain. While there were no significant restructuring expenses at the corporate level this quarter, we remain focused on reducing overhead costs throughout the organization.
Taxes in the quarter benefited from the federal resolution of an IRS audit and an increase in R&D tax credits. We've been successful in capturing these types of tax benefits on a regular basis, and we'll continue to focus on doing so in the future.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion last quarter and $2.3 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $316 million for the quarter and $452 million year-to-date. While working capital has increased since the beginning of the year, we saw improvements this quarter as we expected. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $44.3 billion. A percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 29%. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 47% U.S. and 53% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016 and 2017, which is on Slide 8. To start with, it's worth spending a minute summarizing what drove Q3's results, which were strong if you eliminate the big charge. This was driven by lower G&A, favorable taxes, foreign exchange benefits and favorable profit adjustments in Energy, Chemicals & Mining aside from the big charge. These favorable items were, in the aggregate, worth over $0.30 of EPS.
As a result of the project charge in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we're reducing our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share from $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. The range includes opportunities with respect to tax and other upsides related to contractual matters. For 2017, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share.
Our range for 2017 assumes continued challenges in our commodity-focused segment and a shift in mix from higher-margin engineering to procurement and construction activities, offset by increasing opportunities in infrastructure, industrial and government. Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately 227 -- excuse me, $200 million to $275 million depending upon AMECO opportunities and NuScale expenses of approximately $80 million.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Because it's exclusively in the construction phase, mostly of the issue is relative to piping productivity. When you look at the degree of difficulty of the design, the weather events and everything else, it took us out of sequence. And everybody that's been in this business knows when you get out of sequence, the costs go up. And that's what we've seen here. As I said, the -- in the second quarter, we had a review. But we had not really guided into the piping scope on the ISBL or the inside battery limits. That's what we really started in the third quarter. And when we saw where we were, but more importantly, where -- what it was going to take to get finished is what resulted in the additional craft hours, supervision, indirect materials and the like. We sit at about 60% complete in construction. The project is scheduled to be mechanically complete in late summer or early fall of next year. So we're within a year of completion based on the delayed schedule that we had because of the weather events. So I feel like with -- we took a really hard look at this, almost a conservative look at this because of what we knew we had to get done. I will mention that this project was bid prior to some of the changes that we've made and some of the innovations that we've applied in the integrated solutions model. So when you look at where we're going, we shouldn't have these kind of issues in our backlog or in the projects that we win. So I think we're at a place where we've got our hands around what it's going to take. I'm extremely disappointed, as I said in the release, in where we are. But I feel comfortable that going forward, these types of things will be less of an issue. When you look at '17, I would argue -- I would say it's just in a couple of places. One is there's been a delay in the award of some of the projects even with the TCO project. So it's a book and burn issue that drives us to look at the number we presented. The other issue is I think the competition is extremely tight. And we're probably maybe a little bit more conservative in terms of the win rate that we look to get because we are going to maintain that discipline in terms of risk and pricing. We've got -- when you look at the other businesses though, I think we see good growth opportunities. But they're just not big enough to fill the void of some of the larger programs and projects that are there. So we've taken a bit of a conservative view at next year."

There's the charge and then there's the positives from the other things described, including the comp expense reduction, which affects ECM as well as other parts of the company. There's foreign exchange in there and there was favorable project performance. If you adjust ECM for all of those things in the third quarter, it'd be just over 6% margin at the EBIT level. We expect the fourth quarter to be between 5% and 6%. And then we'll talk about all the segments, including ECM, a little bit more by the time we get to the year-end conference call next February."

And as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we have a very specific key account process that we have where we focus on the customers that we have the best chance of being able to be successful with in terms of delivering those projects and delivering the profitability that we expect. There's some short-term behaviors that will challenge that. But I think in past cycles, we've been able to say no politely on certain things, and in some cases, change the opinions of our customers in terms of what risk they're expecting us to take that we have no ability to control. So as I said, this isn't the first time we've seen this behavior both on our customers' sides and on our customers' sides. But I think we're going to maintain that discipline. And I think that's where our diversity is part of the answer for continuing to grow. We were able to skate to where the puck's going to be and not have to rely on -- going back to a previous question, not rely on a must-win project. We're going to maintain our discipline. I think that even the CPChem project went through a pretty rigorous circumstance. But we had some uncontrollable events that have led us into a situation that would have been bad anyway. But I think we could have done a better job in terms of mitigating some of those risks earlier, but it was still -- been a bad project. But the fact of the matter is we're going to maintain our discipline and we're going to protect the company just like we have in past cycles that looked just like this cycle. Now I would like to comment on the lower for longer piece. When you think about our oil and gas customers as well as our mining customers, I think they've gotten their head around the fact that the commodity prices are going to be maintained at the current levels for a long, long time. And they have, in fact, changed their business model to deal with a lower for longer oil price as an example. So when you look at what's out there, they're prioritizing those projects. You can argue they've taken a longer deep breath here, not having the confidence that the oil prices were going to moderate. And therefore, that pushes the -- even the high-quality projects out in time. And that's what we're experiencing now. I would also say that the conversations we're having with our customers is they've gotten comfortable with their new model. They've gotten comfortable with the lower prices, and they're starting to move forward with the projects that are critical in terms of their growth trajectory. So we're seeing many, many of these customers moving these projects towards FID as we get through next year into '18, '19, '20. So where lower for longer can be seen as a negative, I actually see it as a positive because we're seeing much better behavior from customers in terms of the priorities that they're doing. And these high-value projects are typically the most critical and most complicated projects, which I think feeds right into our value proposition with those customers and what those customers expect us to deliver. So I kind of denoted a little bit of negativity in the way you used the term -- the phrase lower for longer. But in fact, I actually see that as an opportunity now."

Many of these companies rely on reserve basis and other statistics in terms of their product production rates that they just won't simply be able to make if they don't make some of the improvements that are out in front of us. I think if you think about the Kuwaitis right now, those 2 big projects that we have out there, you can argue were done -- were bid in a countercyclical time. But in fact, if the Kuwaitis don't move forward on the fourth refinery like they've done and are a success, they would end up being net importers for motor fuels in the future.

But the secretary has promised that there would be help, whatever that means, in terms of accelerating the review because this is the only the U.S.-owned nuclear technology. And there's some enthusiasm within the DOE to promote this. We also are focused on the U.K., and that dialogue has gone extremely well. We've had a lot of visitors out in Corvallis from both the DOE, NRC, other customers, the U.K. folks, which gives us confidence that, A, the process makes sense to them; B, that the submittal will see a positive result and as expedient a result as possible that the business model, including the cost per kilowatt, matches what their expectations are. So that, I think, is a pretty strong and positive story. Now will it take 39 months for the NRC to review this? Maybe. We hope that this is exciting enough since it is the only U.S. technology that's moving at this pace that they will expedite that. The early questions that have been asked and the answers that we had provided, I think, kind of give us a pretty good view that we've got something that's going to be positively received once the final submittal is made.

So I wouldn't say it's just oil and gas. It's across the board in terms of competitiveness. Now the good news for us is we spent the last 4 years improving our ability to compete. I think our integrated solutions, some of the capital efficiency things, the actions that we've taken to lower capital cost, to increase cost and schedule certainty has been well received by our customers. So those that are willing to get beyond the price war and can actually look at value are looking at us very favorably. Those that cannot and don't want to do the change, if they're good key customers and the risk profile is right and it matches with our discipline, we'll build a stick built for them again. But they won't enjoy the benefits of some of the learnings that we've had. So like I said, this isn't the first time I've seen this. We're going to maintain our discipline. And I know some folks will do some silly things, and maybe in a few years, they'll regret that. But it is what it is. But we've proven over time that we can compete.

One, it's not lowering our prices. It's lowering our cost that we're going to focus on. As I said, this has happened before, and there are certain places around the world where the procurement process is such that they can't look past low price. They have to look at -- they can't look at value. So I'll give you an example where a typical project in the process industries, a FEED is typically between 1% to 2% depending on difficulty of process of TIC for the cost of the FEED. We're seeing some of our competitors bidding in less than 0.5% of TIC for the FEED. Now you can argue that, that's not producing or delivering the same level of information or data to make the decision on the EPC. So I would argue that is a disservice to the customer eventually because if you don't have a complete FEED, you're not going to have a solid EPC bid. And you'll the see change or a gameplay and we're just not going to go down that road. Now like I said, I'm confident in the new award plan that we have embedded in our overall '17 plan and outlook. So that means that based on -- using your term of -- is it 30%? Well, no. We're fine. We've got the projects that meet our criteria to go chase. And we're going to maintain that discipline and go after those projects, which means we're probably not going to go for some of the projects that are taking this price mentality to what I think is a dangerous, dangerous game in terms of long-term capital efficiency.

And I'm starting to see the confidence come back in terms of moving some of these things forward. You -- if you stay on the oil and gas guys, you've seen all the impairment taken care of with lower oil price. You're seeing the oil companies kind of bottoming out in terms of their profitability. And we're starting to see, I think, some confidence in moving some of these capital programs further -- or forward. I think when you look at power, we're starting to see some opportunities in power come back. And you've seen us take some limited notice to proceed projects in this year that obviously are scheduled to hit final notice to proceed during '17. I talked at length about infrastructure and where I see that going. Our pharmaceutical, biotech and advanced manufacturing group, the drugs that have been approved by the FDA is significantly higher than it's bid in the last decade. And so we're seeing growth opportunities in that business. And again, I think the overlay to that is what we've done to try to lower our cost of service, our cost to deliver these capital to answer the bell of our customers around capital efficiency. So when you put all of that together with an overlay of solid annuity-type programs in the government world, in the asset management and integrity business, I think that we're starting to build again that confidence in our ability to deliver in '18, '19.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I'd like to address the challenges that are -- that we have seen on our fixed price project for CPChem in the Gulf Coast, which resulted in a significant charge being taken this quarter. In the second quarter, a revision was made to the project forecast to recognize the impact of several heavy rain events and abnormal site flooding. This situation has created an out-of-sequence work schedule, which continues to have a negative impact on productivity to this day. However, it was during the third quarter that the lack of productivity led to an updated detailed review, the result being our charge for the third quarter, which is related to additional craft hours and indirect costs required to complete the above ground portion of the project. This charge takes into consideration the out-of-sequence schedule and the current levels of productivity. These additional hours became apparent in the third quarter with the increased rate of pipe erection in the process units, which was not proceeding at the expected production rate.
All of this is evidence of what can happen with complex stick built projects -- construction projects when faced with unusual weather conditions and other site disruptions. To answer one of the questions you are likely to have, there are always risk in our business, but these circumstances are currently not evident on any of our other projects.
Now let's turn to the third quarter results beginning with Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the third quarter were $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared with $176 million or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated segment profits for the quarter was $25 million compared to $240 million a year ago. Results for the quarter include improved performance results from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment. Consolidated profit margins were 0.05% compared to 5.5% a year ago. The effect of the charge in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment was 4.8%. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
New awards for the quarter were $7 billion. In fact, new awards are up 29% through the first 9 months compared to last year. Consolidated Fluor backlog at the end was $44.3 billion, up from $41.7 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 4. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $5.6 billion in new awards. This includes an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion program in Kazakhstan. And we're proud to have been working at the Tengiz site for just under 20 years, and I'm pleased to see our customer moving forward with high-value projects during this expansion.
During the quarter, we received notice that the contract for one of our LNG EPC projects we have had in backlog has been suspended. We have made an adjustment to backlog to remove the EPC portion of this project. We also removed some smaller projects, which have been similarly suspended. As a result, we expect to see a faster conversion of our backlog. Backlog in Energy & Chemicals for the quarter was $23.7 billion compared with $30 billion a year ago.
In Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, we continue to see positive trends in revenue as we progressed through 2 nuclear projects for Westinghouse and as infrastructure projects start to ramp up. Ending backlog for this segment was $11.5 billion, up from $5.1 billion a year ago.
Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment had another solid quarter with new awards of just under $1 billion. Awards for the quarter include the additional funding on Department of Energy's Savannah River project. Ending backlog was $5.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year ago.
The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted new awards of $350 million. This includes operations and maintenance work in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. Ending backlog was $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago.
Now that we've covered the quarter, I would like to take a moment to share our perspectives on the markets we serve and what we are doing to strengthen our performance and competitiveness. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, overall global economic growth has underperformed our expectations. We continue to experience greater-than-anticipated headwinds from the commodities in related markets, which impact our Energy, Chemicals & Mining and Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segments.
On a more positive note, we've seen significant increase in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power new awards and backlog, which should contribute to our growth next year. Looking forward, we do expect a modest improvement in the economic growth next year, which should lead to greater consumer spending and growth in industrial production. We expect these increases in economic activity will lead to greater project opportunities for Fluor.
We do believe that in order to maintain supply-demand balances of key commodities like crude oil and copper, our customers will need to move forward with major capital projects, but it will be gradual. We also expect infrastructure and government spending to continue.
As we move into 2017, I remain concerned that this longer -- lower for longer mindset on the commodity prices is starting to distort the E&C contracting market. We're now seeing customers not only expecting lower prices without addressing capital efficiencies but also demanding contractors take on risk that is in some cases outside of the contractor's control. This, along with an increased level of irrational bidding and fee pricing, creates an unusual and challenging marketplace. But we've seen this cycle before.
Having said all that, it's imperative that we maintain the discipline in our approach to pricing and risk management. That means not only seeking the right clients but the right projects with the right clients. It means making sure we appropriately price for risk, advise our clients on the benefits of an integrated solutions approach, and when we win the contract, intensely focus on execution and project completion.
Finally, we are prepared to deal with this lower for longer attitude. This includes controlling our own cost structure, preserving our sound capital structure and demonstrating the value of our integrated solutions approach.
With that, I'll now talk -- turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?"

Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, whi",575,"Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, which compares to $4.4 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity and Government were offset by a decline in Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. As already mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.03 reflect the impact of a charge for a petrochemical facility in the United States. If you add back $1.10 to our results, it's obviously, otherwise, a strong quarter. Although obscured by the large charge, there were offsetting favorable profit pickups, which positively affected ECM margins and consolidated results.
Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $27 million compared to $35 million a year ago. The quarter benefited from lower compensation expense as a result of the charge and from a foreign exchange gain. While there were no significant restructuring expenses at the corporate level this quarter, we remain focused on reducing overhead costs throughout the organization.
Taxes in the quarter benefited from the federal resolution of an IRS audit and an increase in R&D tax credits. We've been successful in capturing these types of tax benefits on a regular basis, and we'll continue to focus on doing so in the future.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion last quarter and $2.3 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $316 million for the quarter and $452 million year-to-date. While working capital has increased since the beginning of the year, we saw improvements this quarter as we expected. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.
Moving to Slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $44.3 billion. A percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 29%. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 47% U.S. and 53% non-U.S.
I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016 and 2017, which is on Slide 8. To start with, it's worth spending a minute summarizing what drove Q3's results, which were strong if you eliminate the big charge. This was driven by lower G&A, favorable taxes, foreign exchange benefits and favorable profit adjustments in Energy, Chemicals & Mining aside from the big charge. These favorable items were, in the aggregate, worth over $0.30 of EPS.
As a result of the project charge in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, we're reducing our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share from $3.25 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. The range includes opportunities with respect to tax and other upsides related to contractual matters. For 2017, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share.
Our range for 2017 assumes continued challenges in our commodity-focused segment and a shift in mix from higher-margin engineering to procurement and construction activities, offset by increasing opportunities in infrastructure, industrial and government. Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $200 million to $220 million and capital expenditures of approximately 227 -- excuse me, $200 million to $275 million depending upon AMECO opportunities and NuScale expenses of approximately $80 million.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

And then I guess the other question I have is I'm a little perplexed by your 2017 guidance. If we -- it implies a step-down in earnings, earnings of about $0.75 per quarter, whereas if we looked at where you were run rating in 2016, it was more like $0.90 a quarter. We have TCO. You have Westinghouse. You have the infrastructure projects. You have onetime restructuring and integration costs that go away. It's just your '17 guidance doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So any color you can provide on that would be helpful."

Because it's exclusively in the construction phase, mostly of the issue is relative to piping productivity. When you look at the degree of difficulty of the design, the weather events and everything else, it took us out of sequence. And everybody that's been in this business knows when you get out of sequence, the costs go up. And that's what we've seen here. As I said, the -- in the second quarter, we had a review. But we had not really guided into the piping scope on the ISBL or the inside battery limits. That's what we really started in the third quarter. And when we saw where we were, but more importantly, where -- what it was going to take to get finished is what resulted in the additional craft hours, supervision, indirect materials and the like. We sit at about 60% complete in construction. The project is scheduled to be mechanically complete in late summer or early fall of next year. So we're within a year of completion based on the delayed schedule that we had because of the weather events. So I feel like with -- we took a really hard look at this, almost a conservative look at this because of what we knew we had to get done. I will mention that this project was bid prior to some of the changes that we've made and some of the innovations that we've applied in the integrated solutions model. So when you look at where we're going, we shouldn't have these kind of issues in our backlog or in the projects that we win. So I think we're at a place where we've got our hands around what it's going to take. I'm extremely disappointed, as I said in the release, in where we are. But I feel comfortable that going forward, these types of things will be less of an issue. When you look at '17, I would argue -- I would say it's just in a couple of places. One is there's been a delay in the award of some of the projects even with the TCO project. So it's a book and burn issue that drives us to look at the number we presented. The other issue is I think the competition is extremely tight. And we're probably maybe a little bit more conservative in terms of the win rate that we look to get because we are going to maintain that discipline in terms of risk and pricing. We've got -- when you look at the other businesses though, I think we see good growth opportunities. But they're just not big enough to fill the void of some of the larger programs and projects that are there. So we've taken a bit of a conservative view at next year."

There's the charge and then there's the positives from the other things described, including the comp expense reduction, which affects ECM as well as other parts of the company. There's foreign exchange in there and there was favorable project performance. If you adjust ECM for all of those things in the third quarter, it'd be just over 6% margin at the EBIT level. We expect the fourth quarter to be between 5% and 6%. And then we'll talk about all the segments, including ECM, a little bit more by the time we get to the year-end conference call next February."

So the simple answer to your question is I think we're pretty much at the bottom right now when you look at all of those markets together. Oil and gas, I think, is going to be a little bit later in that uptick. But I think you're going to start to see some things start to break as we get into next year."

And as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we have a very specific key account process that we have where we focus on the customers that we have the best chance of being able to be successful with in terms of delivering those projects and delivering the profitability that we expect. There's some short-term behaviors that will challenge that. But I think in past cycles, we've been able to say no politely on certain things, and in some cases, change the opinions of our customers in terms of what risk they're expecting us to take that we have no ability to control. So as I said, this isn't the first time we've seen this behavior both on our customers' sides and on our customers' sides. But I think we're going to maintain that discipline. And I think that's where our diversity is part of the answer for continuing to grow. We were able to skate to where the puck's going to be and not have to rely on -- going back to a previous question, not rely on a must-win project. We're going to maintain our discipline. I think that even the CPChem project went through a pretty rigorous circumstance. But we had some uncontrollable events that have led us into a situation that would have been bad anyway. But I think we could have done a better job in terms of mitigating some of those risks earlier, but it was still -- been a bad project. But the fact of the matter is we're going to maintain our discipline and we're going to protect the company just like we have in past cycles that looked just like this cycle. Now I would like to comment on the lower for longer piece. When you think about our oil and gas customers as well as our mining customers, I think they've gotten their head around the fact that the commodity prices are going to be maintained at the current levels for a long, long time. And they have, in fact, changed their business model to deal with a lower for longer oil price as an example. So when you look at what's out there, they're prioritizing those projects. You can argue they've taken a longer deep breath here, not having the confidence that the oil prices were going to moderate. And therefore, that pushes the -- even the high-quality projects out in time. And that's what we're experiencing now. I would also say that the conversations we're having with our customers is they've gotten comfortable with their new model. They've gotten comfortable with the lower prices, and they're starting to move forward with the projects that are critical in terms of their growth trajectory. So we're seeing many, many of these customers moving these projects towards FID as we get through next year into '18, '19, '20. So where lower for longer can be seen as a negative, I actually see it as a positive because we're seeing much better behavior from customers in terms of the priorities that they're doing. And these high-value projects are typically the most critical and most complicated projects, which I think feeds right into our value proposition with those customers and what those customers expect us to deliver. So I kind of denoted a little bit of negativity in the way you used the term -- the phrase lower for longer. But in fact, I actually see that as an opportunity now."

We're still looking at low GDP growth globally and some of the same statistics that you guys are using in terms of overall growth. I think the countercyclical piece to this -- and I'll let Biggs talk about the burn. The countercyclical piece to this is they've waited so long that they have to do some of these projects. Many of these companies rely on reserve basis and other statistics in terms of their product production rates that they just won't simply be able to make if they don't make some of the improvements that are out in front of us. I think if you think about the Kuwaitis right now, those 2 big projects that we have out there, you can argue were done -- were bid in a countercyclical time. But in fact, if the Kuwaitis don't move forward on the fourth refinery like they've done and are a success, they would end up being net importers for motor fuels in the future. So there's things like that, that are going to drive decisions that may seem countercyclical to the statistical representation of GDP growth or market performance."

So I've used the term lumpy. I would argue that they're the most lumpy just because of how long it takes for those projects to go from concept to actual funding decisions. We have the Purple Line this year. But I guess from a color perspective, I would say that our infrastructure group is probably as busy on the bidding cycles than I've seen them in many, many years. Again, lots of different projects and lots of different locations that we're bidding. And I see them over the next like 3 or 4 years to be a significant contributor to both revenue growth and profitability as some of these projects come together. One of the things I mentioned in a previous call was how excited I was about the project in South Carolina because it showed we can be competitive on the smaller infrastructure programs and projects because I think that's what's going to drive that market in the near term in the United States. So I'm pretty excited about what they've been able to do and the changes they've made to be, again, more competitive and more attractive in terms of delivering these projects."

One, it's not lowering our prices. It's lowering our cost that we're going to focus on. As I said, this has happened before, and there are certain places around the world where the procurement process is such that they can't look past low price. They have to look at -- they can't look at value. So I'll give you an example where a typical project in the process industries, a FEED is typically between 1% to 2% depending on difficulty of process of TIC for the cost of the FEED. We're seeing some of our competitors bidding in less than 0.5% of TIC for the FEED. Now you can argue that, that's not producing or delivering the same level of information or data to make the decision on the EPC. So I would argue that is a disservice to the customer eventually because if you don't have a complete FEED, you're not going to have a solid EPC bid. And you'll the see change or a gameplay and we're just not going to go down that road. Now like I said, I'm confident in the new award plan that we have embedded in our overall '17 plan and outlook. So that means that based on -- using your term of -- is it 30%? Well, no. We're fine. We've got the projects that meet our criteria to go chase. And we're going to maintain that discipline and go after those projects, which means we're probably not going to go for some of the projects that are taking this price mentality to what I think is a dangerous, dangerous game in terms of long-term capital efficiency. So not quite the answer you wanted to hear, but I feel pretty good about where we are."

As I said earlier, I think going back to Andy's question on lower for longer conversation, I think they've gotten comfortable that they -- we're not going to see $100 oil -- just to use the oil and gas guys, we're not going to see $100 oil again. And I think that what they've done is they've gone through their prioritization process and redone their models at lower for longer commodity prices. And I'm starting to see the confidence come back in terms of moving some of these things forward. You -- if you stay on the oil and gas guys, you've seen all the impairment taken care of with lower oil price. You're seeing the oil companies kind of bottoming out in terms of their profitability. And we're starting to see, I think, some confidence in moving some of these capital programs further -- or forward. I think when you look at power, we're starting to see some opportunities in power come back. And you've seen us take some limited notice to proceed projects in this year that obviously are scheduled to hit final notice to proceed during '17. I talked at length about infrastructure and where I see that going. Our pharmaceutical, biotech and advanced manufacturing group, the drugs that have been approved by the FDA is significantly higher than its bid in the last decade. And so we're seeing growth opportunities in that business. And again, I think the overlay to that is what we've done to try to lower our cost of service, our cost to deliver these capital to answer the bell of our customers around capital efficiency. So when you put all of that together with an overlay of solid annuity-type programs in the government world, in the asset management and integrity business, I think that we're starting to build again that confidence in our ability to deliver in '18, '19. So I think long answer, but I think we've already gotten to where confidence is returning, and some of these projects are moving forward to FID within our customer organizations."
