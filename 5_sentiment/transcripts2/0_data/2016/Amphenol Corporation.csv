We'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. Q4 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
The company closed the fourth quarter with sales and EPS of $1,431,000,000 and $0.63. Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in both U.S. dollars and organically after a very strong third quarter.
For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year, primarily due to the effect of currency translations. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income increased $289 million -- to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was a strong 20.2%, equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impacts from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.
Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program. 
Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of '15 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of '14, excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of '14.
Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and EPS was $0.63, equal to the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding onetime items. For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding onetime items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. Orders for the quarter were $1,463,000,000, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.
The company continues to be in excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1,030,000,000 or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September. 
Inventory days was 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. 
Days sales outstanding was 71 days consistent with September levels. Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable dales were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range.
The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million, to purchase approximately 53 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $39 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments net of cash acquired to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand.
Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion, and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program, and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately 349 -- $343 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. 
As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore, are incorporated in our guidance. 
For the full-year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company's consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level. 
As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts, of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of '16 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. 
In addition, our guidance excludes any onetime charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other onetime acquisition related costs such as amortization of backlog or any onetime costs associated with improvements across structure. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, and of course, we'll have time at the and for questions. 
With respect to the fourth quarter, certainly, our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings despite what's clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1,431,000,000. 
I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1,463,000,000 in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02:1. We're especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company's history as we sustained our industry-leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, 3 of those quarters we've achieved that 20.2%. 
Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company's discipline and financial strength.
I'm extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercised both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy.
Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in -- just here recently in January, and we're extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8 after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our Interconnect product offerings for customers in the IT Datacom, Industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we've added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact, just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford, and what I can only confirm for you is that they're all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization.
Looking into 2016, as Craig discussed, we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will be available to Amphenol, given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Now with respect to the 2015, it's no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5,569,000,000. In addition, we expanded our operating margin to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding onetime items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. We also had, as you all know, a very busy year on our acquisition program in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact, already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we've now been joined by a great range of a new talented managers, thereby strengthening our already impressive management team.
In 2015, it's once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative Interconnect technologies in support of our simple but long-term mission to be the enabler of electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby, have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we entered 2016, I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better, long-term performance for many years to come.
Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balanced and diversified market position, and this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty. And I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales, and I'll just say with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it.
Turning to the markets. First, the military market represented 10% of our sales in our fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were, in fact, pleased in the fourth quarter to see a stronger-than-expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter, with strength across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market.
While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we've continued to expand our high-technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. 
Looking into 2016, while we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch.
The Commercial Aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. We were actually very encouraged during the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp up of new large jet programs.
For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency, driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales. And we believe that, that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we're very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial market as we've taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology Interconnect products.
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect sales to remain flat or slight above these levels in the first quarter, and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new plans ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company.
The Industrial market represented 17% of our sales, both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency, and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued decline in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher-than-expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments.
For the full year 2015, sales in the Industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. 
I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified Industrial business, and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of Interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the Industrial market, and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company.
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition, and looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high teens in the Industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI together with moderate organic growth from the many segments of the Industrial market.
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels.
For the full year 2015, we're very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of Interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world while, at the same time, identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realizing the benefits from this approach for many years to come.
For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels, and for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our Interconnect and sensor products are designed.
The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market.
We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever-dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology position that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our Interconnect and antenna products. 
Looking into the first quarter, we now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels.
Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year, and our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by our normal seasonal decline in sales service providers. No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we've made great strides in developing new Interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into the next-generation wireless systems.
Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not, at this time though, expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future.
Now turning to the information technology and Datacom market, sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server application, together with the strong progress in that we have made selling into the new generation of web and data center customers.
Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I can just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and data center customers. 
Now with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT Datacom market. And this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their data center equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that's driven in particular by the proliferation of the mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing.
Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition. And we continue to look forward to creating great long-term value with our many investments in this space.
Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year. And sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO buildout activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. 
Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. And essentially, we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which, as a result, more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region. 
For the first quarter, while we expect to demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it's still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well-positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of Interconnect and Cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge.
So let me just say with respect to 2015, I'm just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains, even today, very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, increasing position with customers and diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure, combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook. As I've already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world, and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results. 
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1,380,000,000 to $1,420,000,000, and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat the prior year. 
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,040,000,000 to $6.2 billion, and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%. 
We're very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I'm extremely confident that in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take whatever questions there may be."

This is certainly not going to be an overnight action. We are certainly in the process of working with management to go through kind of the details of the organization. But we're very confident and that we'd be able to bring the profitability levels up over some time period."

And the only thing that I would maybe add to that is the management team from FCI, they have also the same aspiration. We have seen this in many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company has may be at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always, from the outside, say, how is it that they can do it? And as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins, and there's nothing better than a little bit of peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI, just like it is with every one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin price less the cost, and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen? Ultimately, what's the timing of that? This is a very hard thing to predict at this stage and I think we've taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though, we remain very confident that we will bring that to close to, if not above the levels of the company."

That's number one thing we do. That's not something you can do overnight. It's something we spent the better part of 2 decades kind of incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past for those especially who followed us through many cycles that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most because we have around the world 90-plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day, as they going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they're going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times, that they're hearing from customers not positive news and when they're hearing not positive news, they don't report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do, they go back to their factory that say, hey, I don't see the orders. I better adjust my resources, and that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That's the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seat belts because it doesn't feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they're getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocation to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That's the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we're going to have that same playbook."

I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to Industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the Industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to the turbulence in the many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization, and by the way, some of that organization in China, that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in Industrial. So I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven't talked about before as part of Industrial, and that's this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our teams did a phenomenal job over the last year or 2 to ferret out this whole new area that is there that is really harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks, and as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is, actually, our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in Industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter, and that's what oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the Industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid-single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that's a very robust outlook actually, given all what one reads in the paper everyday, which seems to be not a great time to be reading paper these last few days. So I think -- and that's coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities."

And then Industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had, and we have, in all honesty, struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that's happening in the Industrial market, whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever, I mean you can go up and down the list of Industrial applications where they're putting more sensors and there's more processing power and thus, there's more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose essentially very robust computer Interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes such a premium. So I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position. Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we've talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channel. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings because it allows us access with those types of products that we haven't had in the past.

So we're taking what I believe is a prudent but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it's not like there's million of customers out there, so there is some concentration in the customer base. But we continue to diversify. We continue to attract new application. If we look at where the growth came this year, it wasn't necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which years ago, we didn't work in laptops. And now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So what will it ultimately be? What will it the kind of new architecture of mobile be?

What I can tell you is that our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies is, no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid- to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from? It's clearly not just coming from units. I think that's very clear. So it's coming from our penetration to new application, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we've got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has a real great asset, in particular as we now have a product offering ranging from Interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw, on a year-over-year basis, not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually, sequentially even, we grew in Asia by double digits. And I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get, was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales."

I think I would -- I think I went over most of that in the prepared remarks, but I would just say that we had probably a more positive view of military, of commercial air, Industrial and automotive, and we have a less positive view of mobile devices, broadband, wireless infrastructure and IT Datacom. I think that, in a nutshell, how we see the markets. I think those latter 4 markets, we would expect to be essentially flattish organically at a market level. Obviously, we have a big impact on wireless infrastructure and IT Datacom with FCI. So we will report certainly strong sales growth in those markets. But our organic expectations are more muted in that space. On the contrary, we feel very good about automotive, about Industrial, aerospace. And as I mentioned very early on, we start to see some renewed signs, green shoots, if you will, of growth in the military market."

No, look, I think, number one, I would just modify it slightly, which is we see a lot of benefit of the product and the technologies from FCI in the IT Datacom, but we also see that in mobile infrastructure, and we see that absolutely in the Industrial space where we also have very complementary and additive high-technology products. But with respect to IT Datacom, we've talked for several quarters about the real transformation that's happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards the service providers, be they web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers are kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with a couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don't have a product offering that fills essentially every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I/Os, in Cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say, you tell us what you need, and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price-performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that, that is something that will, over the long term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT Datacom market in 2016, where we had a more modest expectations. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we're in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending also it's a capital item, and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlikely ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically, and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we're going to have the best solution for it."

Dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that it is this year. So that's certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014, we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So I don't know about 6 quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter, and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will -- there is developing like there was last time a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take the equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the Interconnect products that we have, and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products, at least in our industry, to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned, we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis, and that was the first quarter in I'd say 3 or 4 that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit. From a regional basis, I would tell you that we've seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market, at least in the recent quarter. And we've started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that. And our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I'm never going to bet on India in terms of the market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India, and to the extent that they do ultimately build the levels that they have, that can be also another sign of life from for mobile networks."

There's been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We've seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they might not have had access and we've also seen great reception from customers where we didn't have a strong access before with our Interconnect products. So I tell you, from my perspective, I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience. In terms of the end market exposure, advanced sensors when we bought it was about 2/3 Industrial, 1/3 automotive, and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So I'd say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and Industrial. And within Industrial, again there's diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So there's a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there's a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise, the types of sensors that we're selling into those applications. So we feel great about the deals. We feel great about the progress so far, and we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition."

So we've been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and Industrial products, and they've been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT Datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction because we didn't have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage. Industrial is one which I've already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT Datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I'd say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan, in China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM and new generation of IT Datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that's another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI irrespective of the market position is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low-cost areas are products that we don't make in those areas. So there's a whole range also of capabilities that we're very excited about, and I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low-hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company."

And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that, yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It's a market that's extremely hard to predict and one that's volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation, and ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don't know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is working or not growing? I think you can read 5 reports and get 5 different answers right now. So what we do is we guide based on what we're seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to Industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses and that related to credit, I don't know necessarily that's related to credits. I think it's related to really dirty air. And so I think that other some other places in the world are coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable, and they're doing things about it. And I don't know that, that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time? We'll see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area in what is otherwise an Industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs."

We'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. 
Q4 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
The company closed the fourth quarter with sales and EPS of $1,431,000,000 and $0.63. Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in both U.S. dollars and organically after a very strong third quarter.
For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year, primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income increased $289 million -- to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was a strong 20.2%, equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
From a segment standpoint. In the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. 
We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program. 
Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of '15 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. 
The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of '14 excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of '14.
Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and EPS was $0.63, equal to the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding onetime items. 
For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding onetime items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. 
Orders for the quarter were $1,463,000,000, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1,030,000,000 or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September. Inventory days was 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. 
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, consistent with September levels. 
Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable days were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range.
The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million; to purchase approximately 53 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditures of $39 million; to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments, net of cash acquired, to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand.
Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program, and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately 349 -- $343 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore are incorporated in our guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company's consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level. As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. 
From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts, of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of '16 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. In addition, our guidance excludes any onetime charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other onetime acquisition-related costs such as amortization of backlog or any onetime costs associated with improvements of cost structure. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, and of course, we'll have time at the and for questions. 
With respect to the fourth quarter. Certainly, our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings despite what is clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1,431,000,000. I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1,463,000,000 in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02:1. 
We're especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company's history as we sustained our industry-leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, 3 of those quarters we have achieved that 20.2%. 
Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company's discipline and financial strength.
I'm extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercise both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy.
Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in -- just here recently in January and we're extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8 after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our Interconnect Product offering for customers in the IT data com, industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we have added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact, just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford and what I can only confirm for you is that they're all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization.
Looking into 2016. As Craig discussed, we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will now be available to Amphenol given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Now with respect to the 2015. It's no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. 
First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5,569,000,000. 
In addition, we expanded our operating margins to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding onetime items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. 
We also had, as you all know, a very busy year on our acquisition program as in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, DoCharm and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact, already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we've now been joined by a great range of a new, talented managers thereby strengthening our already impressive management team.
And 2015, it's once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies in support of our simple, but long-term mission to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. 
While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we entered 2016, I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better, long-term performance for many years to come.
Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balanced and diversified market position and this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty, and I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales, and I'll just say that with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it.
Turning to the markets. First, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were, in fact, pleased in the fourth quarter to see a stronger-than-expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter with strength in most -- across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market.
While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we've continued to expand our high-technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. 
Looking into 2016. While we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch.
The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. We were actually very encouraged, though, in the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp-ups of new large jet programs. For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency, driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales and we believe that, that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. 
Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we're very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial end market as we've taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.
Looking ahead to 2016. We expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels in the first quarter and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new plans ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales, both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued decline in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher-than-expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments. For the full year 2015, sales in the industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. 
I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified industrial business and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. 
Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the industrial market and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company.
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition. And looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high teens in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI, together with the moderate organic growth from the many segments of the industrial market.
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels. For the full year 2015, we're very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. 
Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world while at the same time identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from this approach for many years to come.
For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels, and for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed.
The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market.
We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever-dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology positions that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever-broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our interconnect and antenna products. 
Looking into the first quarter. We now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp-ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year and our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by a normal seasonal decline in sales to service providers. 
No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we've made great strides in developing new interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into next-generation wireless systems.
Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not at this time, though, expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future.
Now turning to the information technology and data com market. Sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server applications, together with the strong progress that we have made selling into the new generation of web and data center customers.
Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I can just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and data center customers. 
Now with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT data com market and this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their data center equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that's driven, in particular, by the proliferation of new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing.
Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition and we continue to look forward to creating great, long-term value with our many investments in this space.
Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year, and sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency and essentially we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market, together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which, as a result, more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region. 
For the first quarter, while we expect demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it's still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge.
So let me just say with respect to 2015, I'm just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains, even today, very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program, to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, increasing position with customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure, combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook. As I've already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world, and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results: for the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1,380,000,000 to $1,420,000,000; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat to prior year. 
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,040,000,000 to $6.2 billion; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%. 
We are very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I'm extremely confident that -- in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take whatever questions there may be."

They have similar, if not even slightly more, exposure to certain currencies and so there is a significant impact of currency translation. In addition, we closed on the deal in January 8, so we lose a solid week of sales in the year. And I would just tell you that if you think about the markets where FCI is, we have what I consider a relatively prudent and conservative outlook in those markets looking forward and I would say that FCI is no different than that.

We have seen this in -- many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company is maybe at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always, from the outside, say, how is it that they can do it? And as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins. And there is nothing better than a little bit of peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI, just like it is with every  one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin, price less the cost, and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen? Ultimately, what's the timing of that? This is a very hard thing to predict at this stage and I think we've taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though, we remain very confident that we will bring that to -- close to, if not above, the levels of the company."

That's #1 thing we do. That's not something you can do overnight. It's something we spent the better part of 2 decades incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past, for those especially who followed us through many cycles, that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most because we have around the world 90-plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day, and they're going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they're going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times, that they're hearing from customers not positive news, and when they're hearing not positive news, they don't report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do, they go back to their factory that say, ""Hey, I don't see the orders. I better adjust my resources."" And that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That's the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seat belts because it doesn't feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they're getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocation to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That's the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we're going to have that same playbook."

I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to Industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the Industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to this turbulence in those many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization, and by the way, some of that organization in China, that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in Industrial. So I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven't talked about before as part of Industrial, and that's this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our teams did a phenomenal job over the last year or 2 to ferret out this whole new area, that is there, that is really a harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks, and as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is, actually, our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in Industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter, and that's with oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the Industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid-single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that's a very robust outlook actually, given all what one reads in the paper everyday which seems to be not a great time to be reading papers, these last few days. So I think -- and that's coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities."

And then Industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had, and we have, in all honesty, struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that's happening in the Industrial market, whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever, I mean you can go up and down the list of Industrial applications where they're putting more sensors and there's more processing power and thus, there's more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose, essentially, very robust computer Interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing in them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes, it's such a premium. So I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position. Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we've talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channel. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings, because it allows us to access with those types of products that we haven't had in the past. So I think that there is really strength, both from market and a regional perspective."

It's one where we came in to 2015 with relatively muted expectations. Ultimately, our team was able to really to outperform in that space, growing for the full year essentially by 13%, which was certainly not what we had expected coming into the year. But it is a very hard market to put a line in the sand on and say, that's -- we do anticipate to grow. So we're taking what I believe is a prudent but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it's not like there's millions of customers out there, so there is some concentration in the customer base, but we continue to diversify, we continue to attack new application. If we look at where the growth came this year, it wasn't necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which -- years ago, we didn't work in laptops, and now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So what will it ultimately be? What will the new architecture of mobile be? It's just very hard for us to predict.

So I couldn't even tell you exactly what content growth is and what unit volume growth is. I think I read the same papers, but I know there's lots of other detailed studies that we don't pay for. What I can tell you is, our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies is, no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid- to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from? It's clearly not just coming from units. I think that's very clear. So it's coming from our penetration to new application, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we've got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has been a real great asset, in particular, as we now have a product offering ranging from Interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw, on a year-over-year basis, not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually, sequentially even, we grew in Asia by double digits, and I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get, was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales."

But with respect to IT Datacom, we talked -- we've talked for several quarters about the real transformation that's happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards these service providers, be they web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers are kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with a couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, your -- the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don't have a product offering that fills, essentially, every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I/Os, in Cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say, you tell us what you need, and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price-performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that, that is something that will, over the long term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT Datacom market in 2016, where we have a more modest expectation. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we're in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending, also, it's a capital item, and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlike we've ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically, and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we're going to have the best solution for it."

Dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that it is this year. So that's certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014, we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So I don't know about the 6 quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter, and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will -- there is developing like there was last time, a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the Interconnect products that we have, and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products, at least in our industry, to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned, we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis, and that was the first quarter in I'd say 3 or 4 that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit. From a regional basis, I would tell you that we've seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market, at least in the recent quarter. And we've started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that, and our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I'm never going to bet on India in terms of a market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India, and to the extent that they do ultimately build at the levels that they have, that can be also another sign of life for mobile networks."

And I can tell you that we feel really good about the progress, and we added obviously Casco a year later, and that is -- I can just say that, that's a very positive impression, both with our customers as well as internally. There's been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We've seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they would not have had access, and we've also seen great reception from some customers where we didn't have a strong of an access before with our Interconnect products. So I tell you, from my perspective, I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience. In terms of the end market exposure, advanced sensors when we bought, it was about 2/3 Industrial, 1/3 automotive, and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So I'd say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and Industrial. And within Industrial, again there is a diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So there's a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there's a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise the types of sensors that we're selling into those applications. So we feel great about the deals, and we feel great about the progress so far, and we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition."

So we've been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and Industrial products, and they've been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT Datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction because we didn't have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage. Industrial is one which I've already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT Datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I'd say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan, and China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM, and new generation of IT Datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that's another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI, irrespective of the market position, is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low-cost areas or products that we don't make in those areas. So there's a whole range also of capabilities that we're very excited about, and I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low-hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company."

So are you kind of deemphasizing some things? Or is your exposure causing you to do that? Because it's really not like the industry is expecting the handset industry to be down. I mean, there's some other part of the business I'm missing, and then the follow up question is, on the Industrial side, it seems like we saw some strength.

With respect to mobility, I think you did the right calculation, 30% down, and as I said, that's similar to what we saw in prior year, and I think even for the last 3 years almost. And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that, yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It's a market that's extremely hard to predict and one that's volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation, and ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don't know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is working or not growing? I think you can read 5 reports and get 5 different answers right now. So what we do is we guide based on what we're seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to Industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses, and is that related to credit? I don't know necessarily if that's related to credits. I think it's related to really dirty air. And so I think that there is a lot of places in the world who're coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable, and they're doing things about it. And I don't know that, if that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time? We'll see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area in what is otherwise an Industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs."

Been with Amphenol for more than a decade, and he knows exactly what it takes to bring a large enterprise into Amphenol and to really go through that cultural transformation that is something that takes time, but it takes also a great focus. The prior executive running FCI, who is also a fabulous individual as part of a private equity sale, that was natural that he would be moving on, and we were very happy that the whole current management team who now reports to the gentleman who is running that is part of Amphenol. They're very strong, robust and excited to be part of the team. And they're doing that under the leadership of someone who has gone through this exact same transformation in a very, very successful fashion in years past. So otherwise, we're not mushing things together. We're not going through radical transformation. But we're doing the things that are necessary from an operating standpoint, as Craig alluded to, to get the margins up, and long term, in Amphenol, it's not like we have sacred cows and we say nothing can go. We're going to be very thoughtful about that. But at the end of the day, we feel that, that is an enterprise that is going to be a high-performance enterprise going forward.
Very good. I think that is our final question. So on behalf of Craig and I, we again wish you all a happy new year.

We'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. 
Q4 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
The company closed the fourth quarter with sales and EPS of $1,431,000,000.63. Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in both U.S. dollars and organically after a very strong third quarter.
For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year, primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income increased $289 million -- to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was a strong 20.2%, equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
From a segment standpoint. In the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. 
We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby has maximized both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program. 
Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of '15 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. 
The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of '14 excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of '14.
Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and EPS was $0.63, equal to the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding onetime items. 
For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding onetime items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. 
Orders for the quarter were $1,463,000,000, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1,030,000,000 or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September. Inventory days were 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. 
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, consistent with September levels. 
Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable days were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range.
The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million; to purchase approximately 53 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditure of $39 million; to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments, net of cash acquired, to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand.
Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program, and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately 349 -- $343 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore are incorporated in our guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company's consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level. As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. 
From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of '16 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. In addition, our guidance excludes any onetime charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other onetime acquisition-related costs such as amortization of backlog or any onetime costs associated with improvements of cost structure. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, and of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the fourth quarter. Certainly, our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings despite what is clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1,431,000,000. I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1,463,000,000 in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02:1. 
We're especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company's history as we sustained our industry-leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, 3 of those quarters we have achieved that 20.2%. 
Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company's discipline and financial strength.
I'm extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercise both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy.
Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in -- just here recently in January and we're extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8 after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our Interconnect Product offering for customers in the IT data com, industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we have added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact, just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford and what I can only confirm for you is that they're all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization.
Looking into 2016. As Craig discussed, we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will now be available to Amphenol given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Now with respect to the 2015. It's no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. 
First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5,569,000,000. 
In addition, we expanded our operating margins to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding onetime items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. 
We also had, as you all know, a very busy year on our acquisition program as in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, DoCharm and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact, already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we've now been joined by a great range of new, talented managers thereby strengthening our already impressive management team.
In 2015, it's once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies in support of our simple, but long-term mission to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. 
While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we enter 2016, I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better, long-term performance for many years to come.
Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balanced and diversified market position and this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty, and I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales, and I'll just say that with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it.
Turning to the markets. First, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were, in fact, pleased in the fourth quarter to see a stronger-than-expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter with strength in most -- across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market.
While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we've continued to expand our high-technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. 
Looking into 2016. While we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch.
The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. We were actually very encouraged, though, in the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp-ups of new large jet programs. For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency, driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales, and we believe that, that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. 
Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we're very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial end market as we've taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.
Looking ahead to 2016. We expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels in the first quarter and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new planes ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales, both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued decline in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher-than-expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments. For the full year 2015, sales in the industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. 
I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified industrial business and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. 
Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the industrial market and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company.
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition. And looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high teens in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI, together with the moderate organic growth from the many segments of the industrial market.
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels. For the full year 2015, we're very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. 
Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world while at the same time identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from this approach for many years to come.
For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels, and for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed.
The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market.
We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever-dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology positions that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever-broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our interconnect and antenna products. 
Looking into the first quarter. We now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp-ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year and our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by a normal seasonal decline in sales to service providers. 
No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we've made great strides in developing new interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into next-generation wireless systems.
Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not at this time, though, expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future.
Now turning to the information technology and data com market. Sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server applications, together with the strong progress that we have made selling into the new generation of web and data center customers.
Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I can just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and data center customers. 
Now with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT data com market and this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their data center equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that's driven, in particular, by the proliferation of new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing.
Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition and we continue to look forward to creating great, long-term value with our many investments in this space.
Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year, and sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency and essentially we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market, together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which, as a result, more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region. 
For the first quarter, while we expect demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it's still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge.
So let me just say with respect to 2015, I'm just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains, even today, very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program, to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, increasing position with customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure, combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook. As I've already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world, and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results: for the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1,380,000,000 to $1,420,000,000; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat to prior year. 
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,040,000,000 to $6.2 billion; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%. 
We are very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I'm extremely confident that -- in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take whatever questions there may be."

They have similar, if not even slightly more, exposure to certain currencies and so there is a significant impact of currency translation. In addition, we closed on the deal in January 8, so we lose a solid week of sales in the year. And I would just tell you that if you think about the markets where FCI is, we have what I consider a relatively prudent and conservative outlook in those markets looking forward and I would say that FCI is no different in that.

We have seen this in -- many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company is maybe at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always, from the outside, say, how is it that they can do it? And as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins. And there is nothing better than a little bit of peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI, just like it is with every one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin is the price less the cost, and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen? Ultimately, what's the timing of that? This is a very hard thing to predict at this stage and I think we've taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though, we remain very confident that we will bring that to -- close to, if not above, the levels of the company."

In particular, when markets are turbulent like they are today, I think the investment-grade rating is a very important thing. That being said, we still have a lot of capacity, and I think Craig talked about that we have still significant capacity remaining even where we were to get to investment grade. The reality is, our position as an acquirer of preference for companies around the world, that has not changed and that continues to grow. And we have an excellent pipeline of acquisition. Are we going to make another FCI tomorrow? I guess probably not. But do we have a great pipeline of acquisitions, a variety of sizes and are we committed to continuing to drive our acquisition program, which has created so much value for the company? No doubt about it, we're still very committed to that program."

That's #1 thing we do. That's not something you can do overnight. It's something we spent the better part of 2 decades incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past, for those especially who followed us through many cycles, that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most because we have around the world 90-plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day, and they're going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they're going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times, that they're hearing from customers not positive news, and when they're hearing not positive news, they don't report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do. They go back to their factory to say, ""Hey, I don't see the orders. I better adjust my resources."" And that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That's the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seat belts because it doesn't feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they're getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocations to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That's the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we're going to have that same playbook."

I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to Industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the Industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to this turbulence in those many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization, and by the way, some of that organization in China, that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in Industrial. So I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven't talked about before as part of Industrial, and that's this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our teams just did a phenomenal job over the last year or 2 to ferret out this whole new area that is there, that is really a harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks, and as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is, actually, our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in Industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter, and that's with oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the Industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid-single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that's a very robust outlook actually, given all what one reads in the paper every day which seems to be not a great time to be reading papers, these last few days. So I think -- and that's coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities."

I think I also mentioned in mobile infrastructure where we have just a tremendous span of presence. And then Industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had, and we have, in all honesty, struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that's happening in the Industrial market, whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever, I mean you can go up and down the list of Industrial applications where they're putting more sensors and there's more processing power and thus, there's more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose, essentially, very robust computer Interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing in them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes at such a premium. So I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position. Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we've talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channel. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings, because it allows us access with those types of products that we haven't had in the past. So I think that there is really strength, both from market and a regional perspective."

It's one where we came in to 2015 with relatively muted expectations. Ultimately, our team was able really to outperform in that space, growing for the full year essentially by 13%, which was certainly not what we had expected coming into the year. But it is a very hard market to put a line in the sand on and say, that's -- we do anticipate to grow. So we're taking what I believe is a prudent but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it's not like there's millions of customers out there, so there is some concentration in the customer base, but we continue to diversify, we continue to attack new application. If we look at where the growth came this year, it wasn't necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which -- years ago, we didn't work in laptops, and now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So what will it ultimately be? What will the new architecture of mobile be? This is very hard for us to predict. Will we continue to have a very strong position and will we capitalize on every opportunity that we see? No doubt about it.

So I couldn't even tell you exactly what content growth is and what unit volume growth is. I think I read the same papers, but I know there's lots of other detailed studies that we don't pay for. What I can tell you is, our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies is, no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid- to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from? It's clearly not just coming from units. I think that's very clear. So it's coming from our penetration to new application, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we've got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has been a real great asset, in particular, as we now have a product offering ranging from Interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw, on a year-over-year basis, not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually, sequentially even, we grew in Asia by double digits, and I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get, was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales."

There's always new positions that you have on new products. But there is no share loss that we would note or that we have noted across any of our business in mobile.

No, look, I think, number one, I would just modify it slightly, which is we see a lot of benefit of the product and the technologies from FCI in the IT Datacom, but we also see that in mobile infrastructure, and we see that absolutely in the Industrial space where we also have very complementary and additive high-technology products. But with respect to IT Datacom, we talked -- we've talked for several quarters about the real transformation that's happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards these service providers, be they web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers a kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with a couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, your -- the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don't have a product offering that fills, essentially, every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I/Os, in Cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say, you tell us what you need, and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price-performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that, that is something that will, over the long term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT Datacom market in 2016, where we have a more modest expectation. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we're in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending, also, it's a capital item, and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlike we have ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically, and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we're going to have the best solution for it."

Dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that it is this year.

Dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that it is this year. So that's certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014, we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So I don't know about the 6 quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter, and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will -- there is developing like there was last time, a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the Interconnect products that we have, and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products, at least in our industry, to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned, we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis, and that was the first quarter in I'd say 3 or 4 that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit. From a regional basis, I would tell you that we've seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market, at least in the recent quarter. And we've started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that, and our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I'm never going to bet on India in terms of a market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India, and to the extent that they do ultimately build at the level that they have, that can be also another sign of life for mobile networks."

And I can tell you that we feel really good about the progress, and we added obviously Casco a year later, and that is -- I can just say that, that's a very positive impression, both with our customers as well as internally. There's been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We've seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they would not have had access, and we've also seen great reception from some customers where we didn't have as strong of an access before with our Interconnect products. So I tell you, from my perspective, I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience. In terms of the end market exposure, Advanced Sensors when we bought it was about 2/3 Industrial, 1/3 automotive, and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So I'd say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and Industrial. And within Industrial, again there is a diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So there's a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there's a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise the types of sensors that we're selling into those applications. So we feel great about the deals, and we feel great about the progress so far, and we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition."

So we've been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and Industrial products, and they've been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT Datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction because we didn't have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage. Industrial is one which I've already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT Datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I'd say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan, and China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM, and new generation of IT Datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that's another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI, irrespective of the market position, is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low-cost areas or products that we don't make in those areas. So there's a whole range also of capabilities that we're very excited about, and I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low-hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company."

So are you kind of deemphasizing some things? Or is your exposure causing you to do that? Because it's really not like the industry is expecting the handset industry to be down. Or maybe there's some other part of the business I'm missing, and then the follow up question is, on the Industrial side, it seems like we saw some strength.

And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that, yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It's a market that's extremely hard to predict and one that's volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation, and ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don't know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is growing or not growing? I think you can read 5 reports and get 5 different answers right now. So what we do is we guide based on what we're seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to Industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses, and is that related to credits? I don't know necessarily that, that's related to credits. I think it's related to really dirty air. And so I think that there is a lot of places in the world who're coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable, and they're doing things about it. And I don't know that, that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time? We'll see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area in what is otherwise an Industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs."

Been with Amphenol for more than a decade, and he knows exactly what it takes to bring a large enterprise into Amphenol and to really go through that cultural transformation that is something that takes time, but it takes also a great focus. The prior executive running FCI, who is also a fabulous individual as part of a private equity sale, that was natural that he would be moving on, and we were very happy that the whole current management team who now reports to the gentleman who is running that as part of Amphenol. They're very strong, robust and excited to be part of the team. And they're doing that under the leadership of someone who has gone through this exact same transformation in a very, very successful fashion in years past. So otherwise, we're not mushing things together. We're not going through radical transformation. But we're doing the things that are necessary from an operating standpoint, as Craig alluded to, to get the margins up, and long term, in Amphenol, it's not like we have sacred cows and we say nothing can go. We're going to be very thoughtful about that. But at the end of the day, we feel that, that is an enterprise that is going to be a high-performance enterprise going forward.

We'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. 
Q4 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
The company closed the fourth quarter with sales and EPS of $1,431,000,000.63. Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in both U.S. dollars and organically after a very strong third quarter.
For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year, primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income increased $289 million -- to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was a strong 20.2%, equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
From a segment standpoint. In the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. 
We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby has maximized both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program. 
Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of '15 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. 
The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of '14 excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of '14.
Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and EPS was $0.63, equal to the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding onetime items. 
For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding onetime items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. 
Orders for the quarter were $1,463,000,000, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1,030,000,000 or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September. Inventory days were 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. 
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, consistent with September levels. 
Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable days were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range.
The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million; to purchase approximately 53 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditure of $39 million; to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments, net of cash acquired, to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand.
Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program, and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately 349 -- $343 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore are incorporated in our guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company's consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level. As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. 
From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of '16 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. In addition, our guidance excludes any onetime charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other onetime acquisition-related costs such as amortization of backlog or any onetime costs associated with improvements of cost structure. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, and of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the fourth quarter. Certainly, our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings despite what is clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1,431,000,000. I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1,463,000,000 in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02:1. 
We're especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company's history as we sustained our industry-leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, 3 of those quarters we have achieved that 20.2%. 
Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company's discipline and financial strength.
I'm extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercise both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy.
Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in -- just here recently in January and we're extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8 after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our Interconnect Product offering for customers in the IT data com, industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we have added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact, just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford and what I can only confirm for you is that they're all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization.
Looking into 2016. As Craig discussed, we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will now be available to Amphenol given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.
Now with respect to the 2015. It's no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. 
First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5,569,000,000. 
In addition, we expanded our operating margins to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding onetime items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. 
We also had, as you all know, a very busy year on our acquisition program as in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, DoCharm and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact, already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we've now been joined by a great range of new, talented managers thereby strengthening our already impressive management team.
In 2015, it's once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies in support of our simple, but long-term mission to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. 
While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we enter 2016, I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better, long-term performance for many years to come.
Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balanced and diversified market position and this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty, and I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales, and I'll just say that with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it.
Turning to the markets. First, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were, in fact, pleased in the fourth quarter to see a stronger-than-expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter with strength in most -- across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market.
While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we've continued to expand our high-technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. 
Looking into 2016. While we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch.
The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. We were actually very encouraged, though, in the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp-ups of new large jet programs. For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency, driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales, and we believe that, that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. 
Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we're very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial end market as we've taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.
Looking ahead to 2016. We expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels in the first quarter and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new planes ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales, both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued decline in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher-than-expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments. For the full year 2015, sales in the industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. 
I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified industrial business and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. 
Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the industrial market and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company.
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition. And looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high teens in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI, together with the moderate organic growth from the many segments of the industrial market.
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels. For the full year 2015, we're very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. 
Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world while at the same time identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from this approach for many years to come.
For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels, and for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed.
The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market.
We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever-dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology positions that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever-broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our interconnect and antenna products. 
Looking into the first quarter. We now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp-ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year and our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by a normal seasonal decline in sales to service providers. 
No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we've made great strides in developing new interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into next-generation wireless systems.
Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not at this time, though, expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future.
Now turning to the information technology and data com market. Sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server applications, together with the strong progress that we have made selling into the new generation of web and data center customers.
Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I can just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and data center customers. 
Now with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT data com market and this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their data center equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that's driven, in particular, by the proliferation of new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing.
Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition and we continue to look forward to creating great, long-term value with our many investments in this space.
Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year, and sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency and essentially we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market, together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which, as a result, more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region. 
For the first quarter, while we expect demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it's still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge.
So let me just say with respect to 2015, I'm just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains, even today, very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program, to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, increasing position with customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure, combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook. As I've already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world, and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results: for the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1,380,000,000 to $1,420,000,000; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat to prior year. 
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,040,000,000 to $6.2 billion; and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%. 
We are very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I'm extremely confident that -- in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take whatever questions there may be."

At the time we gave the guidance, I think there's 2 aspects of why the $600 million becomes a $570 million. Number one is FCI certainly was impacted by currency as other companies were. They have similar, if not even slightly more, exposure to certain currencies and so there is a significant impact of currency translation. In addition, we closed on the deal in January 8, so we lose a solid week of sales in the year. And I would just tell you that if you think about the markets where FCI is, we have what I consider a relatively prudent and conservative outlook in those markets looking forward and I would say that FCI is no different in that. But I wouldn't necessarily say that there is any significant change in terms of distribution that is any different from what maybe we have. That's not the big thing happening."

We have seen this in -- many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company is maybe at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always, from the outside, say, how is it that they can do it? And as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins. And there is nothing better than a little bit of peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI, just like it is with every one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin is the price less the cost, and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen? Ultimately, what's the timing of that? This is a very hard thing to predict at this stage and I think we've taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though, we remain very confident that we will bring that to -- close to, if not above, the levels of the company."

And we started to see -- Craig mentioned that we saw a little bit of benefit in the quarter in our Cable business and you can bet that our team's being very aggressive on that. But overall, we think that is still a guidance that is well in line with the profitability trends of the company."

That's #1 thing we do. That's not something you can do overnight. It's something we spent the better part of 2 decades incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past, for those especially who followed us through many cycles, that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most because we have around the world 90-plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day, and they're going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they're going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times, that they're hearing from customers not positive news, and when they're hearing not positive news, they don't report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do. They go back to their factory to say, ""Hey, I don't see the orders. I better adjust my resources."" And that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That's the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seat belts because it doesn't feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they're getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocations to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That's the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we're going to have that same playbook."

I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to Industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the Industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to this turbulence in those many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization, and by the way, some of that organization in China, that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in Industrial. So I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven't talked about before as part of Industrial, and that's this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our teams just did a phenomenal job over the last year or 2 to ferret out this whole new area that is there, that is really a harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks, and as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is, actually, our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in Industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter, and that's with oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the Industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid-single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that's a very robust outlook actually, given all what one reads in the paper every day which seems to be not a great time to be reading papers, these last few days. So I think -- and that's coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities."

And then Industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had, and we have, in all honesty, struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that's happening in the Industrial market, whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever, I mean you can go up and down the list of Industrial applications where they're putting more sensors and there's more processing power and thus, there's more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose, essentially, very robust computer Interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing in them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes at such a premium. So I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position. Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we've talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channel. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings, because it allows us access with those types of products that we haven't had in the past. So I think that there is really strength, both from market and a regional perspective."

It's one where we came in to 2015 with relatively muted expectations. Ultimately, our team was able really to outperform in that space, growing for the full year essentially by 13%, which was certainly not what we had expected coming into the year. But it is a very hard market to put a line in the sand on and say, that's -- we do anticipate to grow. So we're taking what I believe is a prudent but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it's not like there's millions of customers out there, so there is some concentration in the customer base, but we continue to diversify, we continue to attack new application. If we look at where the growth came this year, it wasn't necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which -- years ago, we didn't work in laptops, and now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So what will it ultimately be? What will the new architecture of mobile be? This is very hard for us to predict. Will we continue to have a very strong position and will we capitalize on every opportunity that we see? No doubt about it.

So I couldn't even tell you exactly what content growth is and what unit volume growth is. I think I read the same papers, but I know there's lots of other detailed studies that we don't pay for. What I can tell you is, our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies is, no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid- to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from? It's clearly not just coming from units. I think that's very clear. So it's coming from our penetration to new application, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we've got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has been a real great asset, in particular, as we now have a product offering ranging from Interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw, on a year-over-year basis, not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually, sequentially even, we grew in Asia by double digits, and I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get, was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales."

There's always new positions that you have on new products. But there is no share loss that we would note or that we have noted across any of our business in mobile.

No, look, I think, number one, I would just modify it slightly, which is we see a lot of benefit of the product and the technologies from FCI in the IT Datacom, but we also see that in mobile infrastructure, and we see that absolutely in the Industrial space where we also have very complementary and additive high-technology products. But with respect to IT Datacom, we talked -- we've talked for several quarters about the real transformation that's happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards these service providers, be they web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers a kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with a couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, your -- the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don't have a product offering that fills, essentially, every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I/Os, in Cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say, you tell us what you need, and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price-performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that, that is something that will, over the long term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT Datacom market in 2016, where we have a more modest expectation. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we're in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending, also, it's a capital item, and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlike we have ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically, and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we're going to have the best solution for it."

Dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that it is this year. So that's certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014, we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So I don't know about the 6 quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter, and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will -- there is developing like there was last time, a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the Interconnect products that we have, and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products, at least in our industry, to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned, we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis, and that was the first quarter in I'd say 3 or 4 that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit. From a regional basis, I would tell you that we've seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market, at least in the recent quarter. And we've started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that, and our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I'm never going to bet on India in terms of a market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India, and to the extent that they do ultimately build at the level that they have, that can be also another sign of life for mobile networks."

And I can tell you that we feel really good about the progress, and we added obviously Casco a year later, and that is -- I can just say that, that's a very positive impression, both with our customers as well as internally. There's been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We've seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they would not have had access, and we've also seen great reception from some customers where we didn't have as strong of an access before with our Interconnect products. So I tell you, from my perspective, I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience. In terms of the end market exposure, Advanced Sensors when we bought it was about 2/3 Industrial, 1/3 automotive, and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So I'd say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and Industrial. And within Industrial, again there is a diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So there's a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there's a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise the types of sensors that we're selling into those applications. So we feel great about the deals, and we feel great about the progress so far, and we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition."

So we've been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and Industrial products, and they've been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT Datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction because we didn't have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage. Industrial is one which I've already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT Datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I'd say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan, and China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM, and new generation of IT Datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that's another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI, irrespective of the market position, is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low-cost areas or products that we don't make in those areas. So there's a whole range also of capabilities that we're very excited about, and I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low-hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company."

But the real question is, then I may have -- I heard you say you expect it to be down slightly for this year, and I kind of scratch my head because the smartphone market's expected to grow. So are you kind of deemphasizing some things? Or is your exposure causing you to do that? Because it's really not like the industry is expecting the handset industry to be down. Or maybe there's some other part of the business I'm missing, and then the follow up question is, on the Industrial side, it seems like we saw some strength. And if I heard right, correctly, the hybrid bus and truck did well. Is that sustainable? Or is that more driven by some credits or some type of program that came up and went away?

And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that, yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It's a market that's extremely hard to predict and one that's volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation, and ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don't know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is growing or not growing? I think you can read 5 reports and get 5 different answers right now. So what we do is we guide based on what we're seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to Industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses, and is that related to credits? I don't know necessarily that, that's related to credits. I think it's related to really dirty air. And so I think that there is a lot of places in the world who're coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable, and they're doing things about it. And I don't know that, that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time? We'll see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area in what is otherwise an Industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs."

He was actually the individual who shepherded us -- shepherded the TCS company into Amphenol 10 years before. He's been with the company -- with TCS for more than 27 years. Been with Amphenol for more than a decade, and he knows exactly what it takes to bring a large enterprise into Amphenol and to really go through that cultural transformation that is something that takes time, but it takes also a great focus. The prior executive running FCI, who is also a fabulous individual as part of a private equity sale, that was natural that he would be moving on, and we were very happy that the whole current management team who now reports to the gentleman who is running that as part of Amphenol. They're very strong, robust and excited to be part of the team. And they're doing that under the leadership of someone who has gone through this exact same transformation in a very, very successful fashion in years past. So otherwise, we're not mushing things together. We're not going through radical transformation. But we're doing the things that are necessary from an operating standpoint, as Craig alluded to, to get the margins up, and long term, in Amphenol, it's not like we have sacred cows and we say nothing can go. We're going to be very thoughtful about that. But at the end of the day, we feel that, that is an enterprise that is going to be a high-performance enterprise going forward.
Very good. I think that is our final question. So on behalf of Craig and I, we again wish you all a happy new year.

We'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Q1 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A. 
The company closed the first quarter with sales and EPS of $1,451,000,000 and $0.59, excluding onetime items. Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currencies, sales in the first quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and down 8% organically after a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 1% from last year, primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 10% from last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income, excluding onetime items, increased to $270 million in the first quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was 18.6% compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the FCI business acquired in early January. 
As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.3% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily due to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. 
In the Interconnect segment, margins were 20.6% compared to 21.8% last year due to the acquisition of FCI. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. 
Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded onetime charges of approximately $30 million or $0.09 per share during the first quarter related to the FCI acquisition, which closed in January. These include acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges. The acquisition-related transaction costs includes professional fees, transaction taxes and other external transaction-related costs.
Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the first quarter of '16 and 2015, excluding onetime items. 
On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 28.7% and 26.5% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net income, excluding onetime items, was a strong 13% of sales in the first quarter of 2016 although was impacted, as previously discussed, from the acquisition of FCI. 
EPS was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2016, excluding onetime items, and on as-reported basis, EPS was $0.50 and $0.57 for the first quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively.
Orders for the quarter were $1,479,000,000, a 10% increase over the first quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $194 million in the first quarter or approximately 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $934 million at the end of March, and inventory days were 84 days, up 5 days compared to December and within the normal range for our first quarter. 
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of March, and days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately 4 days from December and within the normal range.
Accounts payable was $615 million at end of March, and payable days were 55 days, up 1 day compared to December.
The cash flow from operations of $194 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $53 million and stock option proceeds of $19 million were used primarily to fund acquisitions of $1.2 billion, to purchase approximately $49 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $38 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion, net of translation. As we have mentioned briefly, the purchase price for FCI was funded entirely with offshore cash.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million shares stock repurchase program. 4.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. 
At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $714 million, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. On March 1, 2016, the company entered into a new $2 billion senior revolving credit facility, which replaced the previous $1.5 billion facility. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $877 million under its commercial paper program, and effective April 1, the commercial paper program was also increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities and now total approximately $1.8 billion.
Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion, and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. And Q1 2016 EBITDA was approximately $312 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance, and Adam will now provide an overview of the business and the current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our first quarter achievements here. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets, and then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year, and then, of course, there'll be time for questions at the end. 
With respect to the first quarter, we're very pleased that our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings, and that's despite continued market uncertainty. 
Our revenues increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $1,451,000,000. And very importantly, the company booked a new record of $1,479,000,000 in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02:1. As Craig went through and as we have anticipated, our margins after acquisition-related expenses were lower than prior year due to the impact of FCI but reached a higher-than-expected 18.6% operating margin. And operating cash flow in the quarter was again a very strong $194 million. 
And I just have to say once again how proud I am of this entrepreneurial Amphenol team, who once again has reconfirmed the value of both their discipline as well as their very important agility, and that has driven strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties in the worldwide economy.
Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just point out that once again in the quarter, we continued to have real tremendous balance across our end market diversification as no one of our markets represented more than 19% of our sales in the first quarter, and that's after including FCI, which we acquired at the beginning of the quarter.
Turning first to the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and in local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and ordinance was offset by moderated sales to communications and vehicle applications. And sequentially, our sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter. 
At the end of the first quarter, we were instructed by the United States Defense Logistics Agency, or the DLA, to stop the shipment of several of our military specification connector products that are sold by one of our operations into the U.S. Military market. This was due to the sourcing of certain noncritical piece parts from nonapproved locations, including China as well as delays in regular product testing. I'd just say that we understand that there are no alleged quality issues with respect to these products, and I would also just reaffirm that our practices, we believe, are common in the industry, and thus, we have expressed disagreement with the DLA's stricter rule interpretation. Nevertheless, we have complied with the DLA's order, and we're currently executing on a plan to meet their requirements, which we expect to be completed within the next 2 quarters at the latest. We just also note that the specific products that are impacted represent less than 10% of our annual military sales.
Despite the short-term military challenge, our team continues to do an excellent job of strengthening Amphenol's overall position in the military market. And looking ahead, while we expect sales in the second quarter to moderate slightly from these levels due to this delay issue, we do continue to expect growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Amphenol remains the leader in the military Interconnect industry, with the broadest range of products across virtually all Defense equipments, and this is a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future.
The Commercial Aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were up slightly from prior year as stronger sales onto new airframe airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet sales. Sequentially, our sales were a bit softer than expected as they were down slightly from the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead, while we expect a slight moderation of sales in the second quarter, we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. And I can just reaffirm that we are very pleased with our strong position in the commercial air market. And we continue to take excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation Commercial Aircraft, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology Interconnect products.
The Industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition together with growth in the hybrid bus and truck, instrumentation, medical and alternative energy segments. Organically, sales were essentially flat as growth in those segments was offset by continued significant declines in several markets, including oil and gas, in particular. 
Sequentially, our sales grew by 9%, largely due to the benefits of FCI. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales to increase moderately from these current levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the Industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI together with organic growth from a range of segments across Industrial markets. We remain very proud of our diversified Industrial business, and we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of Interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this exciting market. 
In particular, I would just commend our team, who's done an outstanding job of continuing to unearth growth opportunities amidst the backdrop of what is clearly a more somber global Industrial market outlook.
The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased a strong 11% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 6% organically. And this was driven by expanded sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics as well as growth in hybrid electric vehicles, in which we have a strong content. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%.
We continue to have a positive outlook for the automotive market as we drive a broad range of Interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified array of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, all while at the same time continuing to identify and leverage complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to realizing the benefits from this approach for many, many years to come. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to again increase from these levels, and for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve a strong growth in the automotive market.
The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the first quarter, our sales were down by 6% from prior year and just over 30% from the fourth quarter. Just once again, our team demonstrated incredible agility in this quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this significant sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any opportunities for incremental sales that may become available in the market. We are very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the dynamic mobile devices market. And we're encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms.
While we do expect sales in the second quarter to increase sequentially by at least 20%, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit decline in our sales for the full year of 2016. Regardless of this more muted outlook for the full year, we remain extremely confident that our team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market.
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were better than expected in the first quarter, growing from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales, in particular to network operators across several geographies. Sequentially, we grew by 22% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FCI.
We're really pleased in the first quarter to have achieved renewed organic growth in the mobile networks market, and I think that this is a strong reflection of the company's ongoing efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers as well as equipment makers around the world. Those customers continue to drive their networks to higher levels of performance as mobile users, the end users, ultimately demand ever greater bandwidth and more comprehensive coverage. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain essentially at these first quarter levels. And while we continue to expect strong full year growth with the addition of FCI, we think it remains still too early to predict organic growth for the mobile networks market for the full year 2016. Regardless, we remain well positioned to capitalize on any growth opportunity that should arise in this market.
The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were up strongly from prior year and prior quarter as contributions from FCI offset some organic moderation in sales. Our sales overall were up 21% versus prior year. 
With the broadened technology offering and expanded reach into customers that we have gained with the FCI acquisition, we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced, high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web and data -- Web service and data center customers. In particular, we're helping both these new customers as well as our traditional customers in their drive to raise the levels of performance of their equipment to support ongoing and dramatic increases in data traffic.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI.
The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies as multiservice operators, in particular in North America, began to expand their purchasing volumes. Our sales grew by 4% sequentially. While we're very pleased to see these early signs of renewed growth in the broadband market and while we do expect a slight increase from these levels in the second quarter, we continue to believe that the market, the broadband market in 2016 will remain at roughly last year's levels. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many corporate consolidations that are ongoing, we are well-positioned with our expanded range of Interconnect and Cable products to capitalize on any growth opportunities that may emerge.
So just in summary with respect to the first quarter, I just want to tell you how proud I am of the company's strong start to 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well, both organically and through our acquisition program in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. The company's superior results are a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and the full year, based on a continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and the full year 2016  the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,495,000,000 to $1,535,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.64, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase, excluding onetime items, versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 7% to 10%, respectively. 
For the full year 2016, we now anticipate sales in the range of $6,080,000,000 to $6.2 billion and earnings per share, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.56 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this now represents sales and EPS growth, excluding onetime items, of 9% to 11% and 5% to 8%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust start to 2016, and we all look forward to driving further strength going forward even given the many dynamics in the global economy. I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon that strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities, both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability throughout 2016. 
Operator, at that point, we'd be happy to take any questions that there may be."

I think with respect to the first part of your question, as it relates to the building materials, I don't know whether you mean the building materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent in the building materials of our customers. So maybe I'll answer both. On one, I would just tell you that connectors represent a small percentage of the overall building materials, but we're the largest connector manufacturer in the defense industry. So we have a very, very broad presence across essentially every equipment that there is. As it relates to our products, I think I mentioned that the products at issue here, number one, they come from one facility, and number 2, they represent less than 10% of our overall military sales. So from that perspective, it is a relatively minor impact to the overall military business that we have, even if 1 or 2 of those products can end up on lots of different systems around the world. We do believe that this would be a transitory issue. Let me just say that very clearly. We're working very rapidly to address the demands of the DLA, and our team is well, well along in that process. And as I mentioned, we expect this at most to be a 2-quarter disruption as the extent that it is. Will it mean that we will have to source certain things in certain different places? Absolutely, because ultimately, part of the issue arose from sourcing of components in a place that they now have decided not appropriate to source from. So we have already resourced those products, and I can tell you today that the vast majority of what we need to resource has already been resourced, and ultimately, I can tell you that our company is very good at managing through any cost impact that would come from that. We don't expect any material changes to our profitability in that business long term."

And the fact that interest rates are low or not low doesn't necessarily enter into our calculus so much in terms of the price we're willing to pay on the things and how much of our capital we're willing to put to work. We view acquisitions as a very, very long-term initiative. This is not a short-term approach to say, well, it can be accretive in the year, and thus, we will do the acquisition. We're very, very thoughtful about that, and thus, we spend a lot of time. We date many, many, many companies over time. And then eventually, the select few of those that we date ultimately become a strong acquisitions for the company.

We don't have a different view about the organic growth of the company this year. Now when you look at the different markets, it's not that every market has that somber outlook. And I think this really speaks to the value of the diversification of the company. We have one market, mobile devices, which is not a small market for us. Last year in particular, it was significant 18%, 19% of sales market, and we do expect that, that market will be down in the coming year, and that's all organic. On the other side, we have a positive organic outlook for markets like automotive, Industrial. We have a positive outlook for aero, for commercial aviation, and others are more flat. So I think the value of the diversification in a time like this, where there is no question that the overall growth environment is more muted, is really coming through in 2016. What does that mean in terms of the overall growth of the Interconnect industry? There are many studies about that. I think when you compare us to others, you see still a more favorable outlook and a more favorable, ultimately, results in terms of the organic growth compared to the overall industry. And our goal as a company continues to be to outgrow the industry in every environment and through every cycle. And if you look over the course of the last 10, 15 years, we have outgrown the industry by a significant margin, and we still have a long-term conviction to continue to do that going forward."

We saw strength in some places even like in India. We saw some strength in Europe. We didn't see so much strength in Asia in the quarter.

I think that the growth that we are seeing in the second quarter, may be that's a little more than we would normally see in the second quarter and may be the second half is a hair less than we would see in other years.

But I wouldn't necessarily assume some massive snapback. Look, relative to share, in the next 2 quarters, some people going to take some orders that otherwise we would have taken. I guess, by definition, that's the case. But I can tell you, as a company whose been through 2 floods and this is the same facility, which was having a flood in the past, and by the way, I could tell you that these issues relate back even to the time of the flood. But that's not for regulators to sympathize with. I can tell you that this is an organization who does not accept to lose a position, period. And with our breadth of technologies, with our program presence, a 2-quarter stop shipment is not going to hurt Amphenol in the medium or long term in our market position. In fact, I can tell you, we're going to come back so much stronger after this that I would expect over the long term we will further build our leadership position in the military market."

Well, first, I would just make one clarification, which is we don't classify heavy truck as part of our automotive business. That's part of our Industrial business. I certainly wouldn't assume that our margins are different on the heavy trucks than it would be on overall automotive. So automotive is for us really automotive as it is called. We're so happy with Automotive business. You followed us long enough to have seen the trajectory of that business over the last 6, 7 years, going from I think at its low point 5%, 6% of sales to today, 19% of sales. And we've done that both through some wonderful acquisitions together with some just outstanding technology program wins that we've had over those many years. And where we used to be a safety device company with a little bit of telematics, today, we have a very broad and high-technology automotive offering, ranging everything from engine control to antilock braking to electronic transmission to the high-voltage products and into sensors, starting even to make penetration in things like antennas along with the RF products that we've sold for so many years and together with hybrid electric vehicles. And so that breadth that we have into the high-growth content opportunities in the car, that has really been, for us, what has differentiated in terms of our performance. And geographically, our Automotive business has also really transformed from a predominant kind of 2/3 European business to today a less than half of the business in Europe, and really equally spread the rest between North America and Asia. And when we look at our results in the last quarter, actually, we had really strong performance for example in the first quarter coming out of Asia, where there was some talk, last year at least, in terms of some warning signs in that space. But our team in Asia has just done a fantastic job, and we made a nice acquisition as well last year that positioned us with some of the local manufacturers in Asia. So I would just tell you, we continue to grow in our satisfaction with the breadth and the depth of our Automotive business. We're still small on any relative and comparable basis, but we certainly are getting more and more than our fair share as things go on."

So we don't see anything meaningful, plus or minus, relative to changes in the distribution channel. What we do see, and that's for sure, is now having owned FCI for just over 3 months, the relationships, the presence, the discussions that we're having with the distributors have really gone to a next level. And I think that, that is just a testament to the strength that FCI had. You correctly point out, roughly 40% of their sales was on distribution, but what's more important is not that 40%, but rather where that 40% resides with the distributors. We have traditionally been more in the Industrial, the aerospace, the harsh environment products with those distributors, and FCI takes us much more into the more commercial products, a lot of which end up in the embedded computing applications in the Industrial space. And I think that's an area really of excitement among all of our distributors. And so we go from maybe a more traditional position with them to a position that is really right in the wheelhouse of many of their strategies. And I think we really see already the benefits of that in terms of the dialogues that we have had with our distributors and that we continue to have with them. So we thought all along that FCI would be a great asset as it relates to our distribution channel, and I can just tell you 3 months in that, that has been clearly confirmed for me."

That being said, I can tell you, our Industrial team is far from somber. And I think the reason is, is we continue to plum for those opportunities that are there. We are not just stuck to things that aren't growing. But as soon as we see that the opportunity is not there, our team is quickly pivoting towards those areas where there are opportunities. And so we talked about last quarter the one example where we've seen a really great growth out of something like a hybrid bus and truck. We've seen also great growth coming out of alternative energy in areas like new lighting applications. We saw strength in instrumentation in the quarter. Conversely, a market like an oil and gas continues to not be a great place to be, and that is what it is. And our team, who's involved in oil and gas, is doing all the things that you would expect an Amphenol management to do at a time when sales are down very significantly. It is just a kind of a microcosm of all how we view our business overall within Industrial that we drive everyday to make sure that we're appropriately diversified and agile such that we can pivot towards the opportunities that are there in the Industrial market.

Look, hybrid electric vehicles has been something that people have been talking about for pretty close to a decade now, and I would tell you that, today, that seems to be a bit more of a reality than was earlier just the prognosis for hybrid electric vehicles. So we're happy to see that. We're happy to see that we continue to win and gain new content. We've seen a lot of great content in other areas like electronic transmissions, for example. That's something I talked about in the past. It's an area where customers have one of the harshest environments, electronic systems in the car and where there's a unique Interconnect requirement in the very inhospitable part of the car, which is ultimately a transmission. And it's part of the category of applications that I would almost refer to as halfway to hybrid because that's one area, whether that's electronic to transmissions, whether that's motor, whether that's engine management control, these are all areas which allow automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of the car without having to stick a heavy battery and add all of the cost of a hybrid drive into the car. And so I think in general, that is one area that sort of hybrid-ish or half-hybrid area that we have seen good growth, and we continue to see good progress with our customers."

We're very, very pleased with the results here in the first quarter, and I can tell you that there is a lot of activities ongoing across the company. Some of those activities, and Craig alluded to them, are to get the cost structure in order, and we had significant actions here in the first quarter to do so. But there's other activities which is to really identify collaborative opportunities for growth, and those collaborative opportunities fall into a few different categories. One is from a market standpoint, working with customers where we may have a strength with a certain customer in a certain geography and FCI may not work, vice versa. Another may be just into a new market. For example, taking FCI's embedded computing products and seeking to proliferate those into an area like in aerospace, for example, where they didn't have so much presence in the past. And a third and equally important area is that technology collaboration. And what I can just tell you is here in the first 90, 100 days, we have really attacked all of those areas in a very thoughtful way because at the same time as you want to be impatient, you want to get all that stuff done, you have an organization of 7,000 people who have a new family, and they need to adjust to that new family. And we're very thoughtful about how we do that, how we bring the people in, what we ask of them, what we drive them. I mean, this is not an easy process for someone coming into a company. But the initiatives that we have already, we start already see the prospect of value creating between us on those incremental initiatives. When are they going to result in extra sales per se? I think it's too early to pin that on to a day, to a quarter or an outlook. But there's no doubt in my mind that long term, we will have significant opportunities to realize incremental growth because of those very strong initiatives that are really being embraced across the company."

Relative to IT Datacom, I think when I talk about our guidance both at the beginning of the year as well as just now, we did talk about the fact that while we expect a very strong growth because of FCI, we do expect the market overall on organic basis to be roughly at the same levels of last year. Now that does incorporate in the second half some growth compared to the first half, and that's not abnormal in the IT Datacom market, and that is really organically growing from the first half to the second half of the year. And we look forward to that and we feel that, that is not only normal, but it's something that should happen given our real strength with customers. I think the overall IT Datacom market is a market that is going through a lot of transition right now. And you see that in some of the public releases that already come out, but you see that really in terms of the shift of power in the industry and something that I've talked about in the past, that shift of power towards the operators, the service providers, and it's a little bit away from some of the traditional OEMs. I can tell you that our team and in particular, our team as it relates to the acquisition of FCI and the breadth of products that we have from FCI has done an outstanding job of ensuring that we take advantage of that shift as opposed to get injured by that shift. And we're doing a great job to pivot towards some of those new customers. And so while our overall outlook for the year for IT Datacom is a more muted outlook organically, the strength that we have in that space is going to pay great dividends for us. I mean, the reality is, we have a lot of confidence in the importance of that market relative to the Interconnect market long term. This is a market where they are pushing the limits of performance to enable data delivery, whether that be video, voice or other data forms around the world. The challenges that customers are facing in that space are significant, and many of those bottlenecks reside in Interconnect. I can tell you, that's a good recipe to have a good business behind it. When we see customers who struggle with performance and when we can go in and solve of those performance problems, that's a great long-term place to be. And we believe very strongly in the importance of the IT Datacom market. Relative to the communications infrastructure market, specifically in China as you discussed, I think I mentioned that in the first quarter, we saw good strength in the mobile data structure market, in particular, for North America and Europe, and we didn't yet see that sort of strength building in Asia. It doesn't mean that it's not going to come. I think it's too early to call this year is Asia going to be a helper or a hurter in the mobile infrastructure market? Right now, we continue to have what I would call a more prudent outlook. But there's no doubt about it that the growth of mobile data is happening as well in Asia. And I mentioned in one place in particular, which is India, where we have seen really some beginnings of a build out, and we're capitalizing very well on that, and it won't surprise me if that ultimately spreads to other parts of the region."

I think it's 2 years and a quarter now since we made our first acquisition of GE's Advanced Sensors business. I think originally, when we made that acquisition, there is always a question is sensors naturally a higher growth area than Interconnect, and we always said we don't think -- we certainly don't think it's the lower growth than Interconnect. And I haven't changed my opinion. Is it necessarily higher growth than Interconnect? I don't think by definition it is, but is it at least as good of an opportunity as the Interconnect market, we think no doubt about it, which makes some sense when you get down to it because every time you have a new application for a sensor, and that's whether it's in automotive or Industrial or in aerospace, ultimately, that sensor got to connect into the system. And so you may have so many new applications in a plane or a car or a train or a bus, each time you have that new application, that's going to require then some way to get that signal back into the overall system, and that usually is happening through an Interconnect product. And so the reality is that the 2 are not necessarily disconnected in terms of their trends. And we feel very good about that market. I think as we've now gotten a little bit more mature in our experience in the sensor market and as we've gotten out with more customers and as we've learned more about the space, we're really excited to be part of the sensor industry and to have our presence in the sensor industry. Now we're still small. There's no question about that, bigger than we used to be, but smaller than we will be in the future. And I think that we see so many potential growth opportunities in the long term, either organically or through acquisitions over time. And it is such a really exciting technology space, and it's one that really gets to a lot of the underlying technology trends in the various markets that we serve, whether that's in missions control or whether that's performance or autonomous driving or whether that's more control and more analytics that goes on in Industrial equipment, you name it, there's no question about it, sensors have a great future there."

I think you'",491,"Sure. Well, thank you very much, Will. Look, we take away this issue that we already talked excessively about, and you look at our outlook for the market, which is still to have a positive growth in the military market despite that DLA issue. I think you'll get the answer right there to the question, which is that we do have a positive outlook. And I think that positive outlook speaks to the breadth of presence that we have across the military market, whereby we are really participating on essentially every program in those geographies where we're allowed as a U.S. company to participate. And I think whether that is new airplane platforms, whether that is upgrade communication systems, whether that is new avionics and radars, there is definitely growth opportunity that we see starting in this year and long term. Now is this a snap back or a kind of a spike in growth? I would not advocate taking that view of it. But is there really a kind of maybe a more solid footing under the trends of the military market today than there was a couple of years ago? I feel like there is. And you look at our performance even last year in the military market, where we had relatively flat performance in a market where, I think, you would have thought was overall down, there's no doubt about it that we continue to grow our position in the military market, and that's despite any of these sort of mild regulatory hiccups that may come our way. So long term, I think that's a great market to be in. It's a market where we have tremendous presence, and it's a market where there's a lot of innovation around the technologies and around the electronics that are there. We see also in the military market that there is a subtle shift that appears to be happening just more geopolitically. And that subtle shift is that subtle shift away from a more tactical focus, getting a little bit back towards a more strategic focus. And that's a geopolitical topic that you can spend hours to review, but the net-net of that is that when you get to a more strategic priorities in military, the answer, very often, comes down to new technologies and new systems and what can be done with radars, with surveillance, with new fighter jets, with new avionics systems, with new communication systems. And so long term, I think that, that will be a great place to be, and our position remains very, very strong there, and we look forward to capitalizing on those trends going forward.
If I understand correctly, this was our last question, and I'd like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very warm and pleasant spring here. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again here in just around 90 days. Thank you very much."

We'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Q1 results were released this morning. And I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then Q&A. 
The company closed the first quarter with sales and EPS of $1,451,000,000 and $0.59, excluding onetime items. Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currencies, sales in the first quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and down 8% organically after a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was down 1% from last year primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 10% from last year primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income, excluding onetime items, increased to $270 million in the first quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was 18.6% compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the FCI business acquired in early January. 
As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 13.3% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily due to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 20.6% compared to 21.8% last year due to the acquisition of FCI. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded onetime charges of approximately $30 million or $0.09 per share during the first quarter related to the FCI acquisition, which closed in January. These include acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges. The acquisition-related transaction costs includes professional fees, transaction taxes and other external transaction-related costs. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. 
The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the first quarter of '16 and 2015, excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 28.7% and 26.5% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income, excluding onetime items, was a strong 13% of sales in the first quarter of 2016 although it was impacted, as previously discussed, from the acquisition of FCI. EPS was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2016, excluding onetime items. And on as-reported basis, EPS was $0.50 and $0.57 for the first quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively.
Orders for the quarter were $1,479,000,000, a 10% increase over the first quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $194 million in the first quarter or approximately 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $934 million at the end of March and inventory days were 84 days, up 5 days compared to December and within the normal range for our first quarter. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of March and days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately 4 days from December and within the normal range. Accounts payable was $615 million at end of March and payable days were 55 days, up 1 day compared to December.
The cash flow from operations of $194 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $53 million and stock option proceeds of $19 million, were used primarily to fund acquisitions of $1.2 billion, to purchase approximately $49 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $38 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion, net of translation. As we have mentioned previously, the purchase price for FCI was funded entirely with offshore cash.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 4.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $714 million, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. On March 1, 2016, the company entered into a new $2 billion senior revolving credit facility, which replaced the previous $1.5 billion facility. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $877 million under its commercial paper program. And effective April 1, the commercial paper program was also increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's cash and availability under our credit facility is now total approximately $1.8 billion. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. And Q1 2016 EBITDA was approximately $312 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. And Adam will now provide an overview of the business and the current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our first quarter achievements here. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year. And then of course, there'll be time for questions at the end. 
With respect to the first quarter, we're very pleased that our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings. And that's despite continued market uncertainty. Our revenues increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $1,451,000,000. And very importantly, the company booked a new record of $1,479,000,000 in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
As Craig went through and as we had anticipated, our margins after acquisition-related expenses were lower than prior year due to the impact of FCI but reached a higher-than-expected 18.6% operating margin. And operating cash flow in the quarter was again a very strong $194 million. And I just have to say once again how proud I am of this entrepreneurial Amphenol team, who once again has reconfirmed the value of both their discipline as well as their very important agility. And that has driven strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties in the worldwide economy.
Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just point out that once again in the quarter, we continued to have real tremendous balance across our end-market diversification as no one of our markets represented more than 19% of our sales in the first quarter. And that's after including FCI, which we acquired at the beginning of the quarter.
Turning first to the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and in local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and ordnance was offset by moderated sales to communications and vehicle applications. And sequentially, our sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter. 
At the end of the first quarter, we were instructed by the United States Defense Logistics Agency, or the DLA, to stop the shipment of several of our military specification connector products that are sold by one of our operations into the U.S. military market. This was due to the sourcing of certain noncritical piece parts from non-approved locations, including China, as well as delays in regular product testing. I'd just say that we understand that there are no alleged quality issues with respect to these products and would also just reaffirm that our practices, we believe, are common in the industry. And thus, we have expressed disagreement with the DLA's stricter rule interpretation. Nevertheless, we have complied with the DLA's order and we're currently executing on a plan to meet their requirements, which we expect to be completed within the next 2 quarters at the latest. I would just also note that the specific products that are impacted represent less than 10% of our annual military sales.
Despite this short-term regulatory challenge, our team continues to do an excellent job of strengthening Amphenol's overall position in the military market. And looking ahead, while we expect sales in the second quarter to moderate slightly from these levels due to this delay issue, we do continue to expect growth in the low single digits for the full year of 2016. Amphenol remains the leader in the military interconnect industry with the broadest range of products across virtually all defense equipments. And this is a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market were up slightly from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet sales. Sequentially, our sales were a bit softer than expected as they were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, while we expect a slight moderation of sales in the second quarter, we continue to expect growth for the full year of 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. And I can just reaffirm that we are very pleased with our strong position in the commercial air market. And we continue to take excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation commercial aircraft, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition together with growth in the hybrid bus and truck, instrumentation, medical and alternative energy segments. Organically, sales were essentially flat as growth in those segments was offset by continued significant declines in several markets, including oil and gas, in particular. Sequentially, our sales grew by 9%, largely due to the benefits of FCI. 
For the second quarter, we anticipate sales to increase moderately from these current levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI together with organic growth from a range of segments across the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business, and we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this exciting market. In particular, I would just commend our team, who's done an outstanding job of continuing to unearth growth opportunities amidst the backdrop of what is clearly a more somber global industrial market outlook.
The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And sales increased a strong 11% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 6% organically. And this was driven by expanded sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics as well as growth in hybrid electric vehicles, in which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%. We continue to have a positive outlook for the automotive market as we drive a broadened range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified array of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, all while at the same time continuing to identify and leverage complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to realizing the benefits from this approach for many, many years to come. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to again increase from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve strong growth in the automotive market.
The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the first quarter, our sales were down by 6% from prior year and just over 30% from the fourth quarter. Just once again, our team demonstrated incredible agility in this quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this significant sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any opportunities for incremental sales that may become available in the market. We're very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the dynamic mobile devices market. And we are encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. While we do expect sales in the second quarter to increase sequentially by at least 20%, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit decline in our sales for the full year of 2016. Regardless of this more muted outlook for the full year, we remain extremely confident that our team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market.  
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And sales were better than expected in the first quarter, growing from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales, in particular to network operators across several geographies. Sequentially, we grew by 22% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FCI. We're very pleased in the first quarter to have achieved renewed organic growth in the mobile networks market. And I think that this is a strong reflection of the company's ongoing efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers as well as equipment makers around the world. Those customers continue to drive their networks to higher levels of performance as mobile users, the end users, ultimately demand ever greater bandwidth and more comprehensive coverage. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain essentially at these first quarter levels. And while we continue to expect strong full year growth with the addition of FCI, we think it remains still too early to predict organic growth for the mobile networks market for the full year of 2016. Regardless, we remain well positioned to capitalize on any growth opportunity that should arise in this market.
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were up strongly from prior year and prior quarter as contributions from FCI offset some organic moderation in sales. Our sales overall were up 21% versus prior year. With the broadened technology offering and expanded reach into customers that we have gained with the FCI acquisition, we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced, high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web service and data center customers. In particular, we're helping both these new customers as well as our traditional customers in their drive to raise the levels of performance of their equipment to support ongoing and dramatic increases in data traffic. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI.
The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies as multiservice operators, in particular in North America, began to expand their purchasing volumes. Our sales grew by 4% sequentially. While we're very pleased to see these early signs of renewed growth in the broadband market and while we do expect a slight increase from these levels in the second quarter, we continue to believe that the market, the broadband market in 2016 will remain at roughly last year's levels. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many corporate consolidations that are ongoing, we are well positioned with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products to capitalize on any growth opportunities that may emerge.
So just in summary with respect to the first quarter, I just want to tell you how proud I am of the company's strong start to 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well both organically and through our acquisition program in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. The company's superior results are a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly our agile entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Based on a continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and the full year of 2016 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,495,000,000 to $1,535,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.64, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase, excluding onetime items, versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 7% to 10%, respectively. For the full year 2016, we now anticipate sales in the range of $6,080,000,000 to $6.2 billion and earnings per share, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.56 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this now represents sales and EPS growth, excluding onetime items, of 9% to 11% and 5% to 8%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust start to 2016, and we all look forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the global economy. I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon that strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability throughout 2016. 
Operator, at that point, we'd be happy to take any questions that there may be."

I think with respect to the first part of your question as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of",341,"Yes. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. I think with respect to the first part of your question as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of materials of our customers. So maybe I'll answer both. On one, I would just tell you that connectors represent a small percentage of the overall bill of materials, but we're the largest connector manufacturer in the defense industry. So we have a very, very broad presence across essentially every equipment that there is. As it relates to our products, I think I mentioned that the products at issue here, number one, they come from one facility; and number two, they represent less than 10% of our overall military sales. So from that perspective, it is a relatively minor impact to the overall military business that we have, even if 1 or 2 of those products can end up on lots of different systems around the world. We do believe this will be a transitory issue. Let me just say that very clearly. We are working very rapidly to address the demands of the DLA. And our team is well, well along in that process. And as I mentioned, we expect this at most to be a 2-quarter disruption at the extent that it is. Will it mean that we will have to source certain things in certain different places? Absolutely because ultimately part of the issue arose from sourcing of components in a place that they now have decided as not appropriate to source from. So we have already resourced those products. And I can tell you today that the vast majority of what we need to resource has already been resourced. And ultimately, I can tell you that our company is very good at managing through any cost impact that would come from that. And we don't expect any material changes to our profitability in that business long term."

And then we look to pay fair prices for those companies. And the fact that interest rates are low or not low doesn't necessarily enter into our calculus so much in terms of the price we're willing to pay on things and how much of our capital we're willing to put to work. We view acquisitions as a very, very long-term initiative. This is not a short-term approach to say, ""Well, that can be accretive in a year, and thus we will do the acquisition."" We're very, very thoughtful about that. And thus, we spend a lot of time. We date many, many, many companies over time. And then eventually, the select few of those that we date ultimately become strong acquisitions for the company. And we will continue to follow that same approach regardless of what short-term interest rates do or what the overall market multiples will do."

Now when you look at the different markets, it's not that every market has that somber outlook. And I think this really speaks to the value of the diversification of the company. We have one market, mobile devices, which is not a small market for us. Last year in particular, it was significant 18%, 19% of sales market. And we do expect that, that market will be down in the coming year, and that's all organic. On the other side, we have a positive organic outlook for markets like automotive, industrial. We have a positive outlook for commercial aviation and others are more flat. So I think the value of the diversification in a time like this, where there is no question that the overall growth environment is more muted, is really coming through in 2016. What does that mean in terms of the overall growth of the interconnect industry? There are many studies about that. I think when you compare us to others, you see still a more favorable outlook and a more favorable, ultimately, results in terms of the organic growth compared to the overall industry. And our goal as a company continues to be to outgrow the industry in every environment and through every cycle. And if you look over the course of the last 10, 15 years, we have outgrown the industry by a significant margin, and we still have a long-term conviction to continue to do that going forward."

Should the opportunity present itself to have that growth in the year, our organization is so well positioned.

We saw strength in some places even like in India. We saw some strength in Europe. We didn't see so much strength in Asia in the quarter. And I would say that we probably saw more strength coming out of our sales of our product direct to service providers as opposed to the equipment manufacturers.

I think that the growth that we're seeing in the second quarter, maybe that's a little more than we would normally see in the second quarter and may be the second half is a hair less than we would see in other years.

And where we used to be a safety device company with a little bit of telematics, today, we have a very broad high-technology automotive offering, ranging everything from engine control to antilock braking to electronic transmission to high-voltage products, into sensors, starting even to make penetration in things like antennas, along with the RF products that we've sold for so many years and together with hybrid and electric vehicles. And so that breadth that we have into the high-growth content opportunities in the car, that has really been for us what has differentiated in terms of our performance. And geographically, our automotive business has also really transformed from a predominant kind of 2/3 European business to today a less than half of the business in Europe and really equally spread on the rest between North America and Asia. And when we look at our results in the last quarter, actually we had really strong performance, for example, in the first quarter coming out of in Asia, where there was some talk last year at least in terms of some warning signs in that space. But our team in Asia has just done a fantastic job and we made a nice acquisition as well last year that positioned us with some of the local manufacturers in Asia. So I'd just tell you we continue to grow in our satisfaction with the breadth and the depth of our automotive business. We're still small on any relative and comparable basis, but we certainly are getting more and more than our fair share as things go on."

And not surprisingly, they don't see necessarily a correction or a refresh that comes sometimes on the tail of that. So we don't see anything meaningful, plus or minus, relative to changes in the distribution channel. What we do see, and that's for sure, is now having owned FCI for just over 3 months, the relationships, the presence, the discussions that we're having with the distributors have really gone to a next level. And I think that, that is just a testament to the strength that FCI had. You correctly point out, roughly 40% of their sales was on distribution. But what's more important is not that 40%, but rather where that 40% resides with the distributors. We have traditionally been more in the industrial, the aerospace, the harsh environment products with those distributors. And FCI takes us much more into the more commercial products, a lot of which end up in embedded computing applications in the industrial space. And I think that's an area really of excitement among all of our distributors. And so we go from maybe a more traditional position with them to a position that is really right in the wheelhouse of many of their strategies. And I think we really see already the benefits of that in terms of the dialogues that we have had with our distributors and that we continue to have with them. So we thought all along that FCI would be a great asset as it relates to our distribution channel. And I can just tell you 3 months in that, that has been clearly confirmed for me."

That being said, I can tell you our industrial team is far from somber. And I think the reason is we continue to plumb for those opportunities that are there. We are not just stuck to things that aren't growing. But as soon as we see that the opportunity is not there, our team is quickly pivoting towards those areas where there are opportunities. And so we talked about last quarter the one example where we've seen a really great growth out of something like a hybrid bus and truck. We've seen also great growth coming out of alternative energy in areas like new lighting applications. We saw strength in instrumentation in the quarter. Conversely, a market like an oil and gas continues to not be a great place to be. And that is what it is. And our team, who's involved in oil and gas, is doing all the things that you would expect an Amphenol management team to do at a time when sales are down very significantly. It is just a kind of a microcosm of how we view our business overall within industrial that we drive every day to make sure that we are appropriately diversified and agile such that we can pivot towards the opportunities that are there in the industrial market.

We're happy to see that we continue to win and gain new content. We've seen a lot of great content in other areas like electronic transmissions, for example. That's something I've talked about in the past. It's an area where customers have one of the harshest environments, electronic systems in the car and where there's a unique interconnect requirement in a very inhospitable part of the car, which is ultimately transmission. And it's part of a category of applications that I would almost refer to as halfway to hybrid because that's one area, whether that's electronic transmissions, whether that's start-stop motors, whether that's engine management control, these are all areas which allow automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of the car without having to stick a heavy battery and add all of the cost of a hybrid drive into the car. And so I think in general, that is one area this sort of hybrid-ish or half-hybrid area that we have seen good growth and we continue to see good progress with our customers."

We're very, very pleased with the results here in the first quarter. And I can tell you that there is a lot of activities ongoing across the company. Some of those activities, and Craig alluded to them, are to get the cost structure in order. And we had significant actions here in the first quarter to do so. But there's other activities, which is to really identify collaborative opportunities for growth. And those collaborative opportunities fall into a few different categories. One is from a market standpoint, working with customers where we may have a strength with a certain customer in a certain geography and FCI may not work or vice versa. Another maybe just into a new market, for example, taking FCI's embedded computing products and seeking to proliferate those into an area like in aerospace, for example, where they didn't have so much presence in the past. And a third and equally important area is that technology collaboration. And what I can just tell you is here in the first 90, 100 days, we have really attacked all of those areas in a very thoughtful way because at the same time as you want to be impatient, that you want to get all of that stuff done, you have an organization of 7,000 people who have a new family. And they need to adjust to that new family. And we're very thoughtful about how we do that, how we bring the people in, what we ask of them, what we drive them. I mean, this is not an easy process for someone coming into a company. But the initiatives that we have already, we start to already see the prospect of value creating between us on those incremental initiatives. When are they going to result in extra sales per se? I think it's too early to pin that on to a day, to a quarter or an outlook.

Relative to IT datacom, I think when I talked about our guidance both at the beginning of the year as well as just now, we did talk about the fact that while we expect a very strong growth because of FCI, we do expect the market overall on an organic basis to be roughly at the same levels of last year. Now that does incorporate in the second half some growth compared to the first half. And that's not abnormal in the IT datacom market and that is really organically growing from the first half to the second half of the year. And we look forward to that and we feel that, that is not only a normal, but it is something that should happen, given our real strength with customers. I think the overall IT datacom market is a market that is going through a lot of transition right now. And you see that in some of the public releases that already come out. But you see that really in terms of the shift of power in the industry and something that I've talked about in the past, that shift of power towards the operators, the service providers and a little bit away from some of the traditional OEMs. I can tell you that our team, and in particular our team as it relates to the acquisition of FCI and the breadth of products that we have from FCI, has done an outstanding job of ensuring that we take advantage of that shift as opposed to get injured by that shift. And we're doing a great job to pivot towards some of those new customers. And so while our overall outlook for the year for IT datacom is a more muted outlook organically, the strength that we have in that space is going to pay great dividends for us. I mean, the reality is we have a lot of confidence in the importance of that market relative to the interconnect market long term. This is a market where they are pushing the limits of performance to enable data delivery, whether that be video, voice or other data forms around the world. The challenges that customers are facing in that space are significant and many of those bottlenecks reside in interconnect. I can tell you, that's a good recipe to have a good business behind it. When we see customers who struggle with performance and when we can go in and solve those performance problems, that's a great long-term place to be. And we believe very strongly in the importance of the IT datacom market. Relative to the communications infrastructure market, specifically in China as you discussed, I think I mentioned that in the first quarter, we saw good strength in the mobile infrastructure market, in particular for North America and Europe. And we didn't yet see that sort of strength building in Asia. It doesn't mean that it's not going to come. I think it's too early to call this year. Is Asia going to be a helper or a hurter in the mobile infrastructure market? Right now, we continue to have what I would call a more prudent outlook. But there's no doubt about it that the growth of mobile data is happening as well in Asia. And I mentioned in one place in particular, which is India, where we have seen really some beginnings of a build-out and we're capitalizing very well on that. And it won't surprise me if that ultimately spreads to other parts of the region."

I think it's 2 years and a quarter now since we've made our first acquisition of GE's Advanced Sensors Business. I think originally when we made that acquisition, there is always the question, is sensors naturally a higher growth area than interconnect? And we always said we don't think -- we certainly don't think it's a lower growth than interconnect. And I haven't changed my opinion. Is it necessarily higher growth than interconnect? I don't think by definition it is. But is it at least as good of an opportunity as the interconnect market? We think no doubt about it, which makes some sense when you get down to it because every time you have a new application for a sensor, and that's whether it's in automotive or industrial or in aerospace, ultimately that sensor got to connect into the system. And so you may have so many new applications in a plane or a car or a train or a bus. Each time you have that new application, that's going to require then some way to get that signal back into the overall system. And that usually is happening through an interconnect product. And so the reality is that the 2 are not necessarily disconnected in terms of their trends. And we feel very good about that market. I think as we've now gotten a little bit more mature in our experience in the sensor market and as we've gotten out with more customers and as we've learned more about the space, we are really excited to be a part of the sensor industry and to have our presence in the sensor industry. Now we're still small. There's no question about that, bigger than we used to be, but smaller than we will be in the future. And I think that we see so many potential growth opportunities in the long term, either organically or through acquisitions over time. And it is such a really exciting technology space and it's one that really gets to a lot of the underlying technology trends in the various markets that we serve, whether that's in missions control or whether that's performance or autonomous driving or whether that's more control and more analytics that goes on in industrial equipment.

Look, if we take away this issue that we already talked extensively about and you look at our outlook for the market, which is still to have a positive growth in the military market despite that DLA issue, I think you'll get the answer right there to the question, which is that we do have a positive outlook. And I think that positive outlook speaks to the breadth of presence that we have across the military market, whereby we are really participating on essentially every program in those geographies where we're allowed as a U.S. company to participate. And I think whether that is new airplane platforms, whether that is upgrade communications systems, whether that is new avionics and radars, there is definitely a growth opportunity that we see starting in this year and long term. Now is this a snapback or a kind of a spike in growth? I would not advocate taking that view of it. But is there really a kind of maybe a more solid footing under the trends of the military market today than there was a couple of years ago? I feel like there is. And if you look at our performance even last year in the military market, where we had relatively flat performance in a market where, I think, you would have thought was overall down, there's no doubt about it that we continue to grow our position in the military market. And that's despite any of these sort of mild regulatory hiccups that may come our way. So long term, I think that's a great market to be in. It's a market where we have tremendous presence and it's a market where there's a lot of innovation around the technologies and around the electronics that are there. We see also in the military market that there is a subtle shift that appears to be happening just more geopolitically. And that subtle shift is that subtle shift away from a more tactical focus, getting a little bit back towards a more strategic focus. And that's a geopolitical topic that you could spend hours to review. But the net-net of that is that when you get to a more strategic priorities in military, the answer very often comes down to new technologies and new systems and what can be done with radars, with surveillance, with new fighter jets, with new avionics systems, with new communication systems. And so long term, I think that, that will be a great place to be. And our position remains very, very strong there and we look forward to capitalizing on those trends going forward. Well, I think if I understand correctly, this was our last question. And I'd like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very warm and pleasant spring here. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again here in just around 90 days. Thank you very much."

Q1 results were released this morning. And I will provid",1065,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Q1 results were released this morning. And I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then Q&A. 
The company closed the first quarter with sales and EPS of $1,451,000,000 and $0.59, excluding onetime items. Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currencies, sales in the first quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and down 8% organically after a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was down 1% from last year primarily due to the effect of currency translation. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 10% from last year primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income, excluding onetime items, increased to $270 million in the first quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was 18.6% compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the FCI business acquired in early January. 
As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 13.3% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily due to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 20.6% compared to 21.8% last year due to the acquisition of FCI. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded onetime charges of approximately $30 million or $0.09 per share during the first quarter related to the FCI acquisition, which closed in January. These include acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges. The acquisition-related transaction costs includes professional fees, transaction taxes and other external transaction-related costs. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. 
The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the first quarter of '16 and 2015, excluding onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 28.7% and 26.5% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income, excluding onetime items, was a strong 13% of sales in the first quarter of 2016 although it was impacted, as previously discussed, from the acquisition of FCI. EPS was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2016, excluding onetime items. And on as-reported basis, EPS was $0.50 and $0.57 for the first quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively.
Orders for the quarter were $1,479,000,000, a 10% increase over the first quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $194 million in the first quarter or approximately 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $934 million at the end of March and inventory days were 84 days, up 5 days compared to December and within the normal range for our first quarter. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of March and days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately 4 days from December and within the normal range. Accounts payable was $615 million at end of March and payable days were 55 days, up 1 day compared to December.
The cash flow from operations of $194 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $53 million and stock option proceeds of $19 million, were used primarily to fund acquisitions of $1.2 billion; to purchase approximately $49 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditures of $38 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion, net of translation. As we have mentioned previously, the purchase price for FCI was funded entirely with offshore cash.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 4.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $714 million, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. On March 1, 2016, the company entered into a new $2 billion senior revolving credit facility, which replaced the previous $1.5 billion facility. 
At quarter end, the company had issued $877 million under its commercial paper program. And effective April 1, the commercial paper program was also increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities now total approximately $1.8 billion. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. And Q1 2016 EBITDA was approximately $312 million. 
From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. And Adam will now provide an overview of the business and the current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our first quarter achievements here. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter as well as for the full year. And then of course, there'll be time for questions at the end. 
With respect to the first quarter, we're very pleased that our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings. And that's despite continued market uncertainty. Our revenues increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $1,451,000,000. And very importantly, the company booked a new record of $1,479,000,000 in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
As Craig went through and as we had anticipated, our margins after acquisition-related expenses were lower than prior year due to the impact of FCI but reached a higher-than-expected 18.6% operating margin. And operating cash flow in the quarter was again a very strong $194 million. And I just think I have to say once again how proud I am of this entrepreneurial Amphenol team, who once again has reconfirmed the value of both their discipline as well as their very important agility. And that has driven strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties in the worldwide economy.
Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just point out that once again in the quarter, we continued to have real tremendous balance across our end-market diversification as no one of our markets represented more than 19% of our sales in the first quarter. And that's after including FCI, which we acquired at the beginning of the quarter.
Turning first to the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and in local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and ordnance was offset by moderated sales to communications and vehicle applications. And sequentially, our sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter. 
At the end of the first quarter, we were instructed by the United States Defense Logistics Agency, or the DLA, to stop the shipment of several of our military specification connector products that are sold by one of our operations into the U.S. military market. This was due to the sourcing of certain noncritical piece parts from non-approved locations, including China, as well as delays in regular product testing. I'd just say that we understand that there are no alleged quality issues with respect to these products and would also just reaffirm that our practices, we believe, are common in the industry. And thus, we have expressed disagreement with the DLA's stricter rule interpretation. Nevertheless, we have complied with the DLA's order and we're currently executing on a plan to meet their requirements, which we expect to be completed within the next 2 quarters at the latest. I would just also note that the specific products that are impacted represent less than 10% of our annual military sales.
Despite this short-term regulatory challenge, our team continues to do an excellent job of strengthening Amphenol's overall position in the military market. And looking ahead, while we expect sales in the second quarter to moderate slightly from these levels due to this delay issue, we do continue to expect growth in the low single digits for the full year of 2016. Amphenol remains the leader in the military interconnect industry with the broadest range of products across virtually all defense equipment. And this is a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market were up slightly from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet sales. Sequentially, our sales were a bit softer than expected as they were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, while we expect a slight moderation of sales in the second quarter, we continue to expect growth for the full year of 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. And I can just reaffirm that we are very pleased with our strong position in the commercial air market. And we continue to take excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation commercial aircraft, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition together with growth in the hybrid bus and truck, instrumentation, medical and alternative energy segments. Organically, sales were essentially flat as growth in those segments was offset by continued significant declines in several markets, including oil and gas, in particular. Sequentially, our sales grew by 9%, largely due to the benefits of FCI. 
For the second quarter, we anticipate sales to increase moderately from these current levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI together with organic growth from a range of segments across the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business, and we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this exciting market. In particular, I would just commend our team, who's done an outstanding job of continuing to unearth growth opportunities amidst the backdrop of what is clearly a more somber global industrial market outlook.
The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And sales increased a strong 11% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 6% organically. And this was driven by expanded sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics as well as growth in hybrid electric vehicles, in which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%. We continue to have a positive outlook for the automotive market as we drive a broadened range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified array of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, all while at the same time continuing to identify and leverage complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to realizing the benefits from this approach for many, many years to come. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to again increase from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve strong growth in the automotive market.
The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the first quarter, our sales were down by 6% from prior year and just over 30% from the fourth quarter. Just once again, our team demonstrated incredible agility in this quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this significant sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any opportunities for incremental sales that may become available in the market. We're very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the dynamic mobile devices market. And we are encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. While we do expect sales in the second quarter to increase sequentially by at least 20%, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit decline in our sales for the full year of 2016. Regardless of this more muted outlook for the full year, we remain extremely confident that our team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And sales were better than expected in the first quarter, growing from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales, in particular to network operators across several geographies. Sequentially, we grew by 22% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FCI. We're very pleased in the first quarter to have achieved renewed organic growth in the mobile networks market. And I think that this is a strong reflection of the company's ongoing efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers as well as equipment makers around the world. Those customers continue to drive their networks to higher levels of performance as mobile users, the end users, ultimately demand ever greater bandwidth and more comprehensive coverage. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain essentially at these first quarter levels. And while we continue to expect strong full year growth with the addition of FCI, we think it remains still too early to predict organic growth for the mobile networks market for the full year of 2016. Regardless, we remain well positioned to capitalize on any growth opportunity that should arise in this market.
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were up strongly from prior year and prior quarter as contributions from FCI offset some organic moderation in sales. Our sales overall were up 21% versus prior year. With the broadened technology offering and expanded reach into customers that we have gained with the FCI acquisition, we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced, high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web service and data center customers. In particular, we're helping both these new customers as well as our traditional customers in their drive to raise the levels of performance of their equipment to support ongoing and dramatic increases in data traffic. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI.
The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies as multiservice operators, in particular in North America, began to expand their purchasing volumes. Our sales grew by 4% sequentially. While we are very pleased to see these early signs of renewed growth in the broadband market and while we do expect a slight increase from these levels in the second quarter, we continue to believe that the market, the broadband market in 2016 will remain at roughly last year's levels. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many corporate consolidations that are ongoing, we are well positioned with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products to capitalize on any growth opportunities that may emerge.
So just in summary with respect to the first quarter, I just want to tell you how proud I am of the company's strong start to 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well both organically and through our acquisition program in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. The company's superior results are a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Based on a continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and the full year of 2016 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,495,000,000 to $1,535,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.64, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase, excluding onetime items, versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 7% to 10%, respectively. For the full year 2016, we now anticipate sales in the range of $6,080,000,000 to $6.2 billion and earnings per share, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.56 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this now represents sales and EPS growth, excluding onetime items, of 9% to 11% and 5% to 8%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust start to 2016, and we all look forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the global economy. I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon that strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability throughout 2016. 
Operator, at that point, we'd be happy to take any questions that there may be."

I think with respect to the first part of your question as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of",341,"Yes. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. I think with respect to the first part of your question as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of materials of our customers. So maybe I'll answer both. On one, I would just tell you that connectors represent a small percentage of the overall bill of materials, but we're the largest connector manufacturer in the defense industry. So we have a very, very broad presence across essentially every equipment that there is. As it relates to our products, I think I mentioned that the products at issue here, number one, they come from one facility; and number two, they represent less than 10% of our overall military sales. So from that perspective, it is a relatively minor impact to the overall military business that we have, even if 1 or 2 of those products can end up on lots of different systems around the world. We do believe this will be a transitory issue. Let me just say that very clearly. We are working very rapidly to address the demands of the DLA. And our team is well, well along in that process. And as I mentioned, we expect this at most to be a 2-quarter disruption at the extent that it is. Will it mean that we will have to source certain things in certain different places? Absolutely because ultimately part of the issue arose from sourcing of components in a place that they now have decided is not appropriate to source from. So we have already re-sourced those products. And I can tell you today that the vast majority of what we need to re-source has already been re-sourced. And ultimately, I can tell you that our company is very good at managing through any cost impact that would come from that. And we don't expect any material changes to our profitability in that business long term."

I can only comment on the fact that our team continues to do a wonderful job to take advantage of every opportunity that is present in the market. And whether that is on new programs, taking share on other programs, developing new products, expanding the range of products that we sell, expanding the range of customers to whom we sell those products and the different types of platforms that are there because you're dealing with platforms everything within mobile computing devices, that can be tablet computers, that can be laptops, that can be phones, that can be accessories, wearables, all those kind of things.

So Jim, at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.8 billion of capacity under our revolver and cash from an availability perspective after we did the new revolving credit facility that we entered in the first quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, which certainly -- we believe it's very strong capacity and certainly doesn't even take into account the strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate. From a pro forma leverage perspective, we're at approximately 1.5x at the end of the quarter, which is certainly well within our comfort level, certainly giving full and appropriate consideration to our -- the importance of our investment-grade rating. So I would say that we're very comfortable and certainly have sufficient flexibility from a leverage standpoint and believe that we have plenty of capacity for future acquisitions as well as any stock repurchases that may be warranted."

We made -- just at the beginning of the year, closed the largest acquisition in our history. Last year, we completed 3 other acquisitions. And we continue to have a strong pipeline. At the same time, we will always be a disciplined acquirer. So we look for companies that have great people, that have great technology, that have a strongly complementary market position. And then we look to pay fair prices for those companies. And the fact that interest rates are low or not low doesn't necessarily enter into our calculus so much in terms of the price we're willing to pay on things and how much of our capital we're willing to put to work. We view acquisitions as a very, very long-term initiative. This is not a short-term approach to say, ""Well it can be accretive in a year, and thus we will do the acquisition."" We're very, very thoughtful about that. And thus, we spend a lot of time. We date many, many, many companies over time. And then eventually, the select few of those that we date ultimately become strong acquisitions for the company. And we will continue to follow that same approach regardless of what short-term interest rates do or what the overall market multiples will do."

Now when you look at the different markets, it's not that every market has that somber outlook. And I think this really speaks to the value of the diversification of the company. We have one market, mobile devices, which is not a small market for us. Last year in particular, it was significant 18%, 19% of sales market. And we do expect that, that market will be down in the coming year, and that's all organic. On the other side, we have a positive organic outlook for markets like automotive, industrial. We have a positive outlook for aero -- for commercial aviation and others are more flat. So I think the value of the diversification in a time like this, where there is no question that the overall growth environment is more muted, is really coming through in 2016. What does that mean in terms of the overall growth of the interconnect industry? There are many studies about that. I think when you compare us to others, you see still a more favorable outlook and a more favorable, ultimately, results in terms of the organic growth compared to the overall industry. And our goal as a company continues to be to outgrow the industry in every environment and through every cycle. And if you look over the course of the last 10, 15 years, we have outgrown the industry by a significant margin, and we still have a long-term conviction to continue to do that going forward."

We saw strength in some places even like in India. We saw some strength in Europe. We didn't see so much strength in Asia in the quarter. And I would say that we probably saw more strength coming out of our sales of our product direct to service providers as opposed to the equipment manufacturers. And you know that there have been many widely reported corporate combinations among the OEMs in that space.

I think that the growth that we're seeing in the second quarter, maybe that's a little more than we would normally see in the second quarter and may be the second half is a hair less than we would see in other years. And so maybe that's a little bit more imbalanced from that perspective. But I can tell you that we do always take a prudent approach to our outlook in this market.

Well, first, I would just make one clarification, which is we don't classify heavy truck as part of our automotive business. That's part of our industrial business. I certainly wouldn't assume that our margins are different on a heavy truck than it would be on overall automotive. So automotive is for us really automotive as it is called. No, we are so happy with automotive business. You've followed us long enough to have seen the trajectory of that business over the last 6, 7 years, going from, I think, at its low point, 5%, 6% of sales, to today, 19% of sales. And we've done that both through some wonderful acquisitions, together with some just outstanding technology program wins that we've had over those many years. And where we used to be a safety device company with a little bit of telematics, today, we have a very broad high-technology automotive offering, ranging everything from engine control to antilock braking to electronic transmission to high-voltage products, into sensors, starting even to make penetration in things like antennas, along with the RF products that we've sold for so many years and together with hybrid and electric vehicles. And so that breadth that we have into the high-growth content opportunities in the car, that has really been for us what has differentiated in terms of our performance. And geographically, our automotive business has also really transformed from a predominant kind of 2/3 European business to today a less than half of the business in Europe and really equally spread on the rest between North America and Asia. And when we look at our results in the last quarter, actually we had really strong performance, for example, in the first quarter coming out of in Asia, where there was some talk last year at least in terms of some warning signs in that space. But our team in Asia has just done a fantastic job and we made a nice acquisition as well last year that positioned us with some of the local manufacturers in Asia. So I'd just tell you we continue to grow in our satisfaction with the breadth and the depth of our automotive business. We're still small on any relative and comparable basis, but we certainly are getting more and more than our fair share as things go on."

And not surprisingly, they don't see necessarily a correction or a refresh that comes sometimes on the tail of that. So we don't see anything meaningful, plus or minus, relative to changes in the distribution channel. What we do see, and that's for sure, is in now having owned FCI for just over 3 months, the relationships, the presence, the discussions that we're having with the distributors have really gone to a next level. And I think that, that is just a testament to the strength that FCI had. You correctly point out, roughly 40% of their sales was on distribution. But what's more important is not that 40%, but rather where that 40% resides with the distributors. We have traditionally been more in the industrial, the aerospace, the harsh environment products with those distributors. And FCI takes us much more into the more commercial products, a lot of which end up in embedded computing applications in the industrial space. And I think that's an area really of excitement among all of our distributors. And so we go from maybe a more traditional position with them to a position that is really right in the wheelhouse of many of their strategies. And I think we really see already the benefits of that in terms of the dialogues that we have had with our distributors and that we continue to have with them. So we thought all along that FCI would be a great asset as it relates to our distribution channel. And I can just tell you 3 months in that, that has been clearly confirmed for me."

We are not just stuck to things that aren't growing. But as soon as we see that the opportunity is not there, our team is quickly pivoting towards those areas where there are opportunities. And so we talked about last quarter the one example where we've seen a really great growth out of something like a hybrid bus and truck. We've seen also great growth coming out of alternative energy in areas like new lighting applications. We saw strength in instrumentation in the quarter. Conversely, a market like an oil and gas continues to not be a great place to be. And that is what it is.

And we broadened it both from an application, we broadened it geographically, we broadened it by customer. I wouldn't point to just one or another application. I mentioned earlier that we've seen solid growth coming out of hybrid electric vehicles. Look, hybrid electric vehicles has been something that people have been talking about for pretty close to a decade now. And I would tell you that, today, that seems to be a bit more of a reality than was earlier just the prognosis for hybrid electric vehicles. So we're happy to see that. We're happy to see that we continue to win and gain new content. We've seen a lot of great content in other areas like electronic transmissions, for example. That's something I've talked about in the past. It's an area where customers have one of the harshest environments, electronic systems in the car and where there's a unique interconnect requirement in a very inhospitable part of the car, which is ultimately transmission. And it's part of a category of applications that I would almost refer to as halfway to hybrid because that's one area, whether that's electronic transmissions, whether that's start-stop motors, whether that's engine management control, these are all areas which allow automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of the car without having to stick a heavy battery and add all of the cost of a hybrid drive into the car. And so I think in general, that is one area that's sort of hybrid-ish or half-hybrid area that we have seen good growth and we continue to see good progress with our customers."

We're very, very pleased with the results here in the first quarter. And I can tell you that there is a lot of activities ongoing across the company. Some of those activities, and Craig alluded to them, are to get the cost structure in order. And we had significant actions here in the first quarter to do so. But there's other activities, which is to really identify collaborative opportunities for growth. And those collaborative opportunities fall into a few different categories. One is from a market standpoint, working with customers where we may have a strength with a certain customer in a certain geography and FCI may not work or vice versa. Another may be just into a new market, for example, taking FCI's embedded computing products and seeking to proliferate those into an area like in aerospace, for example, where they didn't have so much presence in the past. And a third and equally important area is that technology collaboration. And what I can just tell you is here in the first 90, 100 days, we have really attacked all of those areas in a very thoughtful way because at the same time as you want to be impatient, that you want to get all of that stuff done, you have an organization of 7,000 people who have a new family. And they need to adjust to that new family. And we're very thoughtful about how we do that, how we bring the people in, what we ask of them, what we drive them. I mean, this is not an easy process for someone coming into a company. But the initiatives that we have already, we start to already see the prospect of value creating between us on those incremental initiatives. When are they going to result in extra sales per se? I think it's too early to pin that on to a day, to a quarter or an outlook. But there's no doubt in my mind that long term, we will have significant opportunities to realize incremental growth because of those very strong initiatives that are really being embraced across the company."

Relative to IT datacom, I think when I talked about our guidance both at the beginning of the year as well as just now, we did talk about the fact that while we expect a very strong growth because of FCI, we do expect the market overall on an organic basis to be roughly at the same levels of last year. Now that does incorporate in the second half some growth compared to the first half. And that's not abnormal in the IT datacom market and that is really organically growing from the first half to the second half of the year. And we look forward to that and we feel that, that is not only a normal, but it is something that should happen, given our real strength with customers. I think the overall IT datacom market is a market that is going through a lot of transition right now. And you see that in some of the public releases that already come out. But you see that really in terms of the shift of power in the industry and something that I've talked about in the past, that shift of power towards the operators, the service providers and a little bit away from some of the traditional OEMs. I can tell you that our team, and in particular our team as it relates to the acquisition of FCI and the breadth of products that we have from FCI, has done an outstanding job of ensuring that we take advantage of that shift as opposed to get injured by that shift. And we're doing a great job to pivot towards some of those new customers. And so while our overall outlook for the year for IT datacom is a more muted outlook organically, the strength that we have in that space is going to pay great dividends for us. I mean, the reality is we have a lot of confidence in the importance of that market relative to the interconnect market long term. This is a market where they are pushing the limits of performance to enable data delivery, whether that be video, voice or other data forms around the world. The challenges that customers are facing in that space are significant and many of those bottlenecks reside in interconnect. I can tell you, that's a good recipe to have a good business behind it. When we see customers who struggle with performance and when we can go in and solve those performance problems, that's a great long-term place to be. And we believe very strongly in the importance of the IT datacom market. Relative to the communications infrastructure market, specifically in China as you discussed, I think I mentioned that in the first quarter, we saw good strength in the mobile infrastructure market, in particular for North America and Europe. And we didn't yet see that sort of strength building in Asia. It doesn't mean that it's not going to come. I think it's too early to call this year. Is Asia going to be a helper or a hurter in the mobile infrastructure market? Right now, we continue to have what I would call a more prudent outlook. But there's no doubt about it that the growth of mobile data is happening as well in Asia. And I mentioned in one place in particular, which is India, where we have seen really some beginnings of a build-out and we're capitalizing very well on that. And it won't surprise me if that ultimately spreads to other parts of the region."

I think it's 2 years and a quarter now since we've made our first acquisition of GE's Advanced Sensors Business. I think originally when we made that acquisition, there is always the question, is sensors naturally a higher growth area than interconnect? And we always said we don't think -- we certainly don't think it's a lower growth than interconnect. And I haven't changed my opinion. Is it necessarily higher growth than interconnect? I don't think by definition it is. But is it at least as good of an opportunity as the interconnect market? We think no doubt about it, which makes some sense when you get down to it because every time you have a new application for a sensor, and that's whether it's in automotive or industrial or in aerospace, ultimately that sensor got to connect into the system. And so you may have so many new applications in a plane or a car or a train or a bus. Each time you have that new application, that's going to require then some way to get that signal back into the overall system. And that usually is happening through an interconnect product. And so the reality is that the 2 are not necessarily disconnected in terms of their trends. And we feel very good about that market. I think as we've now gotten a little bit more mature in our experience in the sensor market and as we've gotten out with more customers and as we've learned more about the space, we are really excited to be a part of the sensor industry and to have our presence in the sensor industry. Now we're still small. There's no question about that, bigger than we used to be, but smaller than we will be in the future. And I think that we see so many potential growth opportunities in the long term, either organically or through acquisitions over time. And it is such a really exciting technology space and it's one that really gets to a lot of the underlying technology trends in the various markets that we serve, whether that's emissions control or whether that's performance or autonomous driving or whether that's more control and more analytics that goes on in industrial equipment. You name it, there's no question about it, sensors have a great future there."

Well, thank you very much, Will. Look, if we take away this issue that we already talked extensively about and you look at our outlook for the market, which is still to have a positive growth in the military market despite that DLA issue, I think you'll get the answer right there to the question, which is that we do have a positive outlook. And I think that positive outlook speaks to the breadth of presence that we have across the military market, whereby we are really participating on essentially every program in those geographies where we're allowed as a U.S. company to participate. And I think whether that is new airplane platforms, whether that is upgrade communications systems, whether that is new avionics and radars, there is definitely a growth opportunity that we see starting in this year and long term. Now is this a snapback or a kind of a spike in growth? I would not advocate taking that view of it. But is there really a kind of maybe a more solid footing under the trends of the military market today than there was a couple of years ago? I feel like there is. And if you look at our performance even last year in the military market, where we had relatively flat performance in a market where, I think, you would have thought was overall down, there's no doubt about it that we continue to grow our position in the military market. And that's despite any of these sort of mild regulatory hiccups that may come our way. So long term, I think that's a great market to be in. It's a market where we have tremendous presence and it's a market where there's a lot of innovation around the technologies and around the electronics that are there. We see also in the military market that there is a subtle shift that appears to be happening just more geopolitically. And that subtle shift is that subtle shift away from a more tactical focus, getting a little bit back towards a more strategic focus. And that's a geopolitical topic that you could spend hours to review. But the net-net of that is that when you get to a more strategic priorities in military, the answer very often comes down to new technologies and new systems and what can be done with radars, with surveillance, with new fighter jets, with new avionics systems, with new communication systems. And so long term, I think that, that will be a great place to be. And our position remains very, very strong there and we look forward to capitalizing on those trends going forward. 
Well, I think if I understand correctly, this was our last question. And I'd like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very warm and pleasant spring here. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again here in just around 90 days. Thank you very much."

We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we'll take Q&A. 
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1,548,000,000 and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 -- 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. 
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume as well as the benefit from favorable impact commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed. 
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items, in the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1,582,000,000, a 16% increase over second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 170% -- 117% of net income. For the 6 months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79, down 5 days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June and days sales outstanding were 73 days, down approximately 2 days from the end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March. 
The cash flow from operations of $243 million, along with stock option proceeds of $66 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program. And the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS, excluding one-time items, of $6,080,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and $2.56 to $2.62 to sales of $6,120,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS. This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress and operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few mo",2619,"Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I also like to add my welcome to that of Craig's to all of you who are here on the phone today. And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the second quarter, we are just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant, given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1,548,000,000. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1,582,000,000. And that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%, a really excellent achievement especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI. And that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy. 
So with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete 2 acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products. 
Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber-optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier data center market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's standing service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high-technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space. 
Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is, in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company. 
Turning to our progress across our served markets. I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter, not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales. 
Starting first with the military market. Our military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales were flat from the first quarter. As we had talked about last quarter, we expected, and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter. 
Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels. And we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016 even with the impact from the DLA issue. I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high-technology products across virtually all defense equipment. And that's a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications and in particular, sold through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter. 
Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially. And we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market. 
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially our sales grew as expected by 5% from the first quarter. 
Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high- and low-voltage applications. For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever. And that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market. 
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating the new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive. With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect, sensor and antenna products, we're participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. 
In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history. And this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position for many years to come. 
The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets. While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016. And this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops. 
Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than 10% from 2015 levels. Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms. 
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. 
Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter. We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter. And it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market. 
Turning to the information technology and data communications market. This market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic. 
Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world. We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers. And it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market. 
In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance. 
Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. 
Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect a seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market. We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world. And we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space. 
So just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our dual-pronged strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, the company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Turning to our outlook. Based on a continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,543,000,000 to $1,583,000,000 and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full year of 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6,120,000,000 to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016, and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

And we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I talked about in the past the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline. From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe, and then equally split roughly between the other 2 regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be. With respect to the incentives, it may be in certain areas. I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars. If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to the -- both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have and the application diversification because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well."

We've had a lot of conversations with distributors. I personally have had many of them. And our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement, and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted it",402,"Yes. We've had a lot of conversations with distributors. I personally have had many of them. And our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement, and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted it up, is a great enthusiasm from our distributors on 2 fronts. Number one is they have always had an affection, affinity and loyalty towards FCI. But they had always a little bit of a cloud hanging over in terms of the prior ownership. Whenever you're owned by the financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the home, the ultimate home of FCI. But the second and more important is FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products. And that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech, telecom, IT datacom-type areas, which are still very important for those distributors. Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products. Does it happen in a 6-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors. That gives me great confidence that in the future, we will really see strong benefits from that combination."

I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single-digits range. And today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter. We were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half. We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast us from our customers. It's not that we are losing anything of any note. You are always winning and losing certain things in that space. Let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts. When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt, we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half. And we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half, as we've currently guided it, is going to be up in somewhere in the teens. And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low 20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year, much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter? We've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year, that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations. Now I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunities to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that, in the end, has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand and deal with the moderations in demand if they come. And in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them."

We still have a long-term goal, as we always do and as we've widely communicated, to have FCI perform at the same levels as the rest of Amphenol. And we certainly don't lose sight of that goal. And we have confidence long term to reach that goal. When does it ultimately get there? That's something that is still too early to say. But the early returns and the performance of the team is really fantastic.

And we've talked about the fact that at the time we announced the acquisition that FCI really bolstered our position in the IT datacom market from 2 perspectives. One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental products from a power perspective and I/O, and then the unbelievable array of board-level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space. As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base, in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional, where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers, for example, locally in China. We had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here. They had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider. We had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there. So it just not just rounded out but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct. The IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today. And it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunity are. I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one. It's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. You look at our performance last quarter, we grew 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt, with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of that just excellent agility that our team has displayed here now with also a broader range of weapons to attack. So it's a place that we're very excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space."

There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening. And there's a lot of opportunities to intersect new demands for new functionality from customers. And it's kind of all over the place. There's so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers, reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products as appropriate, that has positioned us very well. I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solution. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately result in something that is mass-produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not. But with some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this, in these very dynamic times, is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them. And that's the approach we've followed in the mobile market over many years. It's the approach we've followed in the datacom market.

We made and announced 2 acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are 2 excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million, and those are just outstanding, outstanding companies. Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market, and I -- we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed on organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none. If you look at our track record of over a long time period, and we think in acquisitions in very long time periods, if you look at us over a very long time, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years, each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we've paid over time what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they are fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, we -- for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly 1x sales for those companies, and these are extremely high-technology companies that we have brought into the company. And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to win be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and midsized companies that become larger there again. And our approach, both organizationally and also from an execution perspective, is just a really, really compelling approach for those companies, and the right companies, we're still very, very confident to win those companies and to bring them into the Amphenol family over time. And you correctly point out that every quarter, you cannot predict are you going to get a deal done or not, but we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions and a great reputation among companies in the industry as a place that represents an outstanding ultimate home for those companies long term."

We saw strong performance also in Asia, and we had growth in North America. But the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle. The year prior was a good cycle, and 2 years before that were not great cycles. And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband, and that continued unabated. When do operators spend their money? On what do they spend their money? What are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using? Where are the content opportunities for us? Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis, but they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limits. And so our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system, maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly just to ultimately support the demands of the networks. And I think I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job, and I think the fact that we've seen now 2 quarters of strong performance really, indeed, accelerating performance, when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that."

SG&A is, I think, at a very effective rate for the sales, our product development and technology expansion is very key in terms of how we spent our money from an SG&A perspective. I think as you look at the second half of the year, I would expect that as a percentage of sales that our SG&A would certainly continue to decline as we get leverage on the increased sales. From an absolute dollar perspective, I don't necessarily know that, that would essentially go down on high volumes."

I think if you go back all the way to 2006, IT datacom was 25% of our sales. I think if you go back, we had maybe a year where mil/aero was a bit higher as a percent of sales. So it's not that 20% is a bright line. I think there is a level beyond which we wouldn't go. What is that? Is it 30%? Is it something like -- somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadth and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the markets, and so as we look an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers in this sort of almost rearchitecting of the nature of the markets. And I think that's just a great credit to the intra-market diversification that we have in IT datacom, but now, we're not putting the brakes in IT datacom. It doesn't change our investment strategy. It doesn't change our appetite for acquisitions or otherwise, but we continue to be very sensitive that whatever we do strategically, we will maintain a good balance, and we won't be over relying on one or another of our markets for the company."

I should also note that there was also some favorable impact from commodities. I think if you looked going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect that broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half. And as such, we would expect some moderation in the cable segment profitability based on kind of normal conversions, but I would say based on the current commodity environment essentially certainly if that doesn't change and demand environment doesn't change that we would expect that the profitability to be roughly in this range, fluxing up and down based on whatever the volumes do."

Time really flies fast here since we acquired first the Advanced Sensor business from GE. I can just tell you that the team has done an outstanding job in our sensor business. We are growing. We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries, and we continue to be just very excited about the space. In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still really reminds us of a bit like the interconnect market of a decade or 2 ago, very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you 2 thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment, 2.5 years in. It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes. I mean, you have competition. You have technology change. You have programs that come and programs that go, very much like you have in the connector industry. And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders. And I think of all the value that we have brought by those 2 acquisitions that we've made so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business, and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business. We had some in heavy equipment. We had some in medical. Well, you can imagine heavy equipment, overall, is a bit more of a challenging space. The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative, from a market share, the overall broad market for sensors, we still just have a very small position, and that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term, both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program."

We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we'll take Q&A. 
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1,548,000,000 and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 -- 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. 
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume as well as the benefit from favorable impact commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed. 
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items, in the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1,582,000,000, a 16% increase over second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 170% -- 117% of net income. For the 6 months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79, down 5 days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June and days sales outstanding were 73 days, down approximately 2 days from the end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March. 
The cash flow from operations of $243 million, along with stock option proceeds of $66 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program. And the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS, excluding one-time items, of $6,080,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and $2.56 to $2.62 to sales of $6,120,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS. This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress and operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the second quarter, we are just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant, given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1,548,000,000. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1,582,000,000. And that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%, a really excellent achievement especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI. And that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy. 
So with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete 2 acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products. 
Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber-optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier data center market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's standing service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high-technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space. 
Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is, in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company. 
Turning to our progress across our served markets. I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter, not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales. 
Starting first with the military market. Our military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales were flat from the first quarter. As we had talked about last quarter, we expected, and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter. 
Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels. And we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016 even with the impact from the DLA issue. I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high-technology products across virtually all defense equipment. And that's a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications and in particular, sold through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter. 
Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially. And we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market. 
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially our sales grew as expected by 5% from the first quarter. 
Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high- and low-voltage applications. For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever. And that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market. 
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating the new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive. With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect, sensor and antenna products, we're participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. 
In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history. And this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position for many years to come. 
The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets. While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016. And this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops. 
Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than 10% from 2015 levels. Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms. 
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. 
Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter. We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter. And it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market. 
Turning to the information technology and data communications market. This market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic. 
Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world. We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers. And it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market. 
In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance. 
Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. 
Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect a seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market. We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world. And we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space. 
So just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our dual-pronged strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, the company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Turning to our outlook. Based on a continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,543,000,000 to $1,583,000,000 and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full year of 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6,120,000,000 to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016, and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

And we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I talked about in the past the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline. From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe, and then equally split roughly between the other 2 regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be. With respect to the incentives, it may be in certain areas. I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars. If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to the -- both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have and the application diversification because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well."

I personally have had many of them. And our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement, and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted it up, is a great enthusiasm from our distributors on 2 fronts. Number one is they have always had an affection, affinity and loyalty towards FCI. But they had always a little bit of a cloud hanging over in terms of the prior ownership. Whenever you're owned by the financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the home, the ultimate home of FCI. But the second and more important is FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products. And that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech, telecom, IT datacom-type areas, which are still very important for those distributors. Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products. Does it happen in a 6-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors. That gives me great confidence that in the future, we will really see strong benefits from that combination."

I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single-digits range. And today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter. We were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half. We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast us from our customers. It's not that we are losing anything of any note. You are always winning and losing certain things in that space. Let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts. When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt, we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half. And we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half, as we've currently guided it, is going to be up in somewhere in the teens. And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low 20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year, much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter? We've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year, that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations. Now I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunities to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that, in the end, has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand and deal with the moderations in demand if they come. And in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them."

One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental products from a power perspective and I/O, and then the unbelievable array of board-level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space. As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base, in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional, where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers, for example, locally in China. We had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here. They had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider. We had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there. So it just not just rounded out but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct. The IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today. And it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunity are. I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one. It's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. You look at our performance last quarter, we grew 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt, with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of that just excellent agility that our team has displayed here now with also a broader range of weapons to attack. So it's a place that we're very excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space."

There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening. And there's a lot of opportunities to intersect new demands for new functionality from customers. And it's kind of all over the place. There's so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers, reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products as appropriate, that has positioned us very well. I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solution. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately result in something that is mass-produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not. But with some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this, in these very dynamic times, is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them.

We made and announced 2 acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are 2 excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million. And those are just outstanding, outstanding companies. Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market. And we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed an organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none. If you look at our track record over a long time period -- and we think in acquisition in very long time periods. If you look at us over a very long time period, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years, each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we've paid over time what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they're fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, we -- for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly 1x sales for those companies. And these are extremely high-technology companies that we have brought into the company. And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and mid-sized companies that become larger there again. And our approach, both organizationally and also from an execution perspective, is just a really, really compelling approach for those companies. And the right companies, we're still very, very confident to win those companies and to bring them into the Amphenol family over time. And you correctly point out that every quarter, you cannot predict, are you going to get a deal done or not. But we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions and a great reputation among companies in the industry as a place that represents an outstanding ultimate home for those companies long term."

We saw strong performance also in Asia and we had growth in North America. But the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle. The year prior was a good cycle. And 2 years before that were not great cycle. And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband. And that continues unabated. When do operators spend their money? On what do they spend their money? What are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using? Where are the content opportunities for us? Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis. But they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limits. And so our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system, maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly just to ultimately support the demands of the networks. And I think I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job. And I think the fact that we've seen now 2 quarters of strong performance really, indeed, accelerating performance, when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that."

What is that? Is it 30%? Is it something like -- somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadth and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the markets. And so as we look an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers in this sort of almost rearchitecting of the nature of the market.

We were very pleased certainly with the growth and resulting profitability performance of the cable segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the margin improved from 14.9% -- from 11.8% last year to 14.9%. I would say this 3 point increase, as again I mentioned in my prepared remarks, reflects strong operating execution on this additional volume as the segment grew by 11% related to the broadband market strength. The team really also did really a nice job to diversify the business into really higher-margin products and maintain really a strong pricing discipline. I should also note that there was also some favorable impact from commodities. I think if you looked going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect the broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half. And as such, we would expect some moderation in the cable segment profitability based on kind of normal conversions. But I would say based on the current commodity environment, and essentially certainly if that doesn't change and the demand environment doesn't change, that we would expect that the profitability to be roughly in this range and fluxing up and down based on whatever the volumes do."

Time really flies fast here since we acquired first the Advanced Sensor business from GE. I can just tell you that the team has done an outstanding job in our sensor business. We are growing. We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries. And we continue to be just very excited about the space. In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still really reminds us of a bit like the interconnect market of a decade or 2 ago, very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you 2 thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment 2.5 years in. It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes. I mean, you have competition. You have technology change. You have programs that come and programs that go, very much like you have in the connector industry. And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders. And I think of all the value that we have brought by those 2 acquisitions that we've made so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business, and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business, we had some in heavy equipment, we had some in medical. Well, you can imagine heavy equipment overall is a bit more of a challenging space. The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative, from a market share, the overall broad market for sensors, we still just have a very small position. And that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program."

Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial comme",1111,"Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we'll take Q&A. 
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1,548,000,000 and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 -- 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. 
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume as well as the benefit from favorable impact commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed. 
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items, in the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1,582,000,000, a 16% increase over second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 170% -- 117% of net income. For the 6 months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79, down 5 days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June and days sales outstanding were 73 days, down approximately 2 days from the end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March. 
The cash flow from operations of $243 million, along with stock option proceeds of $66 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program. And the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS, excluding one-time items, of $6,080,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and $2.56 to $2.62 to sales of $6,120,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS. This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress and operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the second quarter, we are just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant, given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1,548,000,000. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1,582,000,000. And that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%, a really excellent achievement especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI. And that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy. 
So with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete 2 acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products. 
Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber-optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier data center market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's outstanding service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high-technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space. 
Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is, in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company. 
Turning to our progress across our served markets. I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter, not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales. 
Starting first with the military market. Our military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales were flat from the first quarter. As we had talked about last quarter, we expected, and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter. 
Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels. And we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016 even with the impact from the DLA issue. I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high-technology products across virtually all defense equipment. And that's a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications and in particular, sold through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter. 
Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially. And we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market. 
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially our sales grew as expected by 5% from the first quarter. 
Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high- and low-voltage applications. For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever. And that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market. 
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating the new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive. With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect, sensor and antenna products, we're participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. 
In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history. And this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position for many years to come. 
The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets. While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016. And this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops. 
Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than 10% from 2015 levels. Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms. 
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. 
Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter. We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter. And it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market. 
Turning to the information technology and data communications market. This market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic. 
Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world. We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers. And it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market. 
In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance. 
Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. 
Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect a seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market. We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world. And we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space. 
So just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through a dual-pronged strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, the company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Turning to our outlook. Based on a continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,543,000,000 to $1,583,000,000 and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full year of 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6,120,000,000 to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016, and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

And we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I talked about in the past the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline. From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe, and then equally split roughly between the other 2 regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be. With respect to the incentives that may be in certain areas. I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars. If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to the -- both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have and the application diversification because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well."

I personally have had many of them. And our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement, and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted it up, is a great enthusiasm from our distributors on 2 fronts. Number one is they have always had an affection, affinity and loyalty towards FCI. But they had always a little bit of a cloud hanging over it in terms of the prior ownership. Whenever you're owned by the financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the home, the ultimate home of FCI. But the second and more important is FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products. And that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech, telecom, IT datacom-type areas, which are still very important for those distributors. Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products. Does it happen in a 6-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors. That gives me great confidence that in the future, we will really see strong benefits from that combination."

I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single-digits range. And today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter. We were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half. We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast to us from our customers. It's not that we are losing anything of any note. You are always winning and losing certain things in that space. Let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts. When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt, we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half. And we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half, as we've currently guided it, is going to be up in somewhere in the teens. And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low 20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year, much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter? We've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year, that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations. Now I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunities to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that, in the end, has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand and deal with the moderations in demand if they come. And in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them."

And we talked about the fact that at the time we announced the acquisition that FCI really bolstered our position in the IT datacom market from 2 perspectives. One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental products from a power perspective and I/O, and then the unbelievable array of board-level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space. As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base, in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional, where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers, for example, locally in China. We had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here. They had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider. We had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there. So it just not just rounded out but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct. The IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today. And it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunities are. I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one. It's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. You look at our performance last quarter, we grew it 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt, with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of that just excellent agility that our team has displayed here now with also a broader range of weapons to attack. So it's a place that we're very excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space."

There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening. And there's a lot of opportunities to intersect new demands for new functionality from customers. And it's kind of all over the place. There's so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers, reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products as appropriate, that has positioned us very well. I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solution. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately result in something that is mass-produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not. But with some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this, in these very dynamic times, is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them.

And that's what's so exciting for us is that there's still so many electronic applications that are coming. And as each new thing comes along, that's a new opportunity for us to create a renewed platform for growth. And I think we see that in North America as much as we see that in Europe and in Asia. As it relates to our performance in North America related to the SAAR and the overall volumes, we don't have a strong view on what SAAR will be this year and what the impact of that will be on us. I think we expect still to have strong performance in North America for the year. Although, I guess, at this point, we would expect Europe and Asia to be a bit stronger."

Moving into 2016, as we've discussed, we've had an overall level of ROS and conversion margin that, although negatively impacted by the inclusion of the FCI that's at a lower than our company average, from kind of an organic perspective, we've really converted quite well into the second quarter. And certainly, part of that strong sequential margin improvement that we've had, 30% sequential quarter conversion into the second quarter, 80 basis point improvement, part of that really does relate to our organic business. I'm not going to talk about so much about 2017. We certainly still see no improvement potential in the FCI business. And certainly that will happen over time, which essentially equates to that happening into 2017. But I think right now, we're really happy with where we are. We've performed at a very good level.

We made and announced 2 acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are 2 excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million. And those are just outstanding, outstanding companies. Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market. And we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed an organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none. If you look at our track record over a long time period -- and we think in acquisitions in very long time periods. If you look at us over a very long time period, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years, each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we have paid over time what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they're fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, we -- for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly 1x sales for those companies. And these are extremely high-technology companies that we have brought into the company. And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and mid-sized companies that become larger there again. And our approach, both organizationally and also from an execution perspective, is just a really, really compelling approach for those companies. And the right companies, we're still very, very confident to win those companies and to bring them into the Amphenol family over time. And you correctly point out that every quarter, you cannot predict, are you going to get a deal done or not. But we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions and a great reputation among companies in the industry as a place that represents an outstanding ultimate home for those companies long term."

We saw strong performance also in Asia and we had growth in North America. But the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle. The year prior was a good cycle. And 2 years before that were not great cycles. And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband. And that continues unabated. When do operators spend their money? On what do they spend their money? What are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using? Where are the content opportunities for us? Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis. But they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limits. And so our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system, maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly just to ultimately support the demands of the networks. And I think -- I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job. And I think the fact that we've seen now 2 quarters of strong performance really, indeed, accelerating performance, when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that."

I think if you go back, we had maybe a year where mil aero was a bit higher as a percent of sales. So it's not that 20% is a bright line. I think there is a level beyond which we wouldn't go. What is that? Is it 30%? Is it something like -- somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadth and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the markets. And so as we look an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers in this sort of almost re-architecting of the nature of the market. And I think that's just a great credit to the intramarket diversification that we have in IT datacom. But no, we're not putting the brakes on IT datacom. It doesn't change our investment strategy. It doesn't change our appetite for acquisitions or otherwise.

I should also note that there was also some favorable impact from commodities. I think if you looked going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect the broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half.

Time really flies fast here since we acquired first the Advanced Sensor business from GE. I can just tell you that the team has done an outstanding job in our sensor business. We are growing. We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries. And we continue to be just very excited about the space. In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still really reminds us of a bit like the interconnect market of a decade or 2 ago, very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you 2 thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment 2.5 years in. It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes. I mean, you have competition. You have technology change. You have programs that come and programs that go, very much like you have in the connector industry. And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders. And I think of all the value that we have brought by those 2 acquisitions that we've made so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business -- and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business, we had some in heavy equipment, we had some in medical. Well, you can imagine heavy equipment overall is a bit more of a challenging space. The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative, from a market share, the overall broad market for sensors, we still just have a very small position. And that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program."

Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial comme",1111,"Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we'll take Q&A. 
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1,548,000,000 and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 -- 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. 
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume as well as the benefit from favorable impact commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed. 
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items, in the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1,582,000,000, a 16% increase over second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 170% -- 117% of net income. For the 6 months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79, down 5 days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June and days sales outstanding were 73 days, down approximately 2 days from the end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March. 
The cash flow from operations of $243 million, along with stock option proceeds of $66 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program. And the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS, excluding one-time items, of $6,080,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and $2.56 to $2.62 to sales of $6,120,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS. This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress and operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far.

And I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
With respect to the second quarter, we are just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant, given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1,548,000,000. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1,582,000,000. And that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. 
We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%, a really excellent achievement especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI. And that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy. 
So with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete 2 acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products. 
Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber-optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier data center market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's outstanding service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high-technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space. 
Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is, in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company. 
Turning to our progress across our served markets. I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter, not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales. 
Starting first with the military market. Our military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales were flat from the first quarter. As we had talked about last quarter, we expected, and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter. 
Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels. And we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016 even with the impact from the DLA issue. I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high-technology products across virtually all defense equipment. And that's a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications and in particular, sold through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter. 
Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially. And we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016 as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market. 
The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially our sales grew as expected by 5% from the first quarter. 
Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high- and low-voltage applications. For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever. And that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market. 
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating the new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive. With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect, sensor and antenna products, we're participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. 
In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history. And this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position for many years to come. 
The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets. While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016. And this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops. 
Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than 10% from 2015 levels. Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms. 
The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically as we benefited from the contributions of FCI as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. 
Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter. We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter. And it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market. 
Turning to the information technology and data communications market. This market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic. 
Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world. We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers. And it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market. 
In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance. 
Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. 
Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect a seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market. We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world. And we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space. 
So just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through a dual-pronged strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, the company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. 
Turning to our outlook. Based on a continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,543,000,000 to $1,583,000,000 and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full year of 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6,120,000,000 to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels. 
We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016, and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

And we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I talked about in the past the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline. From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe, and then equally split roughly between the other 2 regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be. With respect to the incentives that may be in certain areas. I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars. If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to the -- both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have and the application diversification because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well."

Whenever you're owned by the financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the home, the ultimate home of FCI. But the second and more important is FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products. And that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech, telecom, IT datacom-type areas, which are still very important for those distributors. Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products. Does it happen in a 6-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors. That gives me great confidence that in the future, we will really see strong benefits from that combination."

I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single-digits range. And today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter. We were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half. We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast to us from our customers. It's not that we are losing anything of any note. You are always winning and losing certain things in that space. Let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts. When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt, we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half. And we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half, as we've currently guided it, is going to be up in somewhere in the teens. And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low 20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year, much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter? We've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year, that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations. Now I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunities to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that, in the end, has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand and deal with the moderations in demand if they come. And in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them."

And we talked about the fact that at the time we announced the acquisition that FCI really bolstered our position in the IT datacom market from 2 perspectives. One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental products from a power perspective and I/O, and then the unbelievable array of board-level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space. As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base, in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional, where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers, for example, locally in China. We had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here. They had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider. We had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there. So it just not just rounded out but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct. The IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today. And it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunities are. I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one. It's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. You look at our performance last quarter, we grew it 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt, with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of that just excellent agility that our team has displayed here now with also a broader range of weapons to attack. So it's a place that we're very excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space."

There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening. And there's a lot of opportunities to intersect new demands for new functionality from customers. And it's kind of all over the place. There's so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers, reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products as appropriate, that has positioned us very well. I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solution. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately result in something that is mass-produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not. But with some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this, in these very dynamic times, is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them.

We made and announced 2 acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are 2 excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million. And those are just outstanding, outstanding companies. Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market. And we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed an organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none. If you look at our track record over a long time period -- and we think in acquisitions in very long time periods. If you look at us over a very long time period, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years, each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we have paid over time what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they're fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, we -- for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly 1x sales for those companies. And these are extremely high-technology companies that we have brought into the company. And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and mid-sized companies that become larger there again.

We saw strong performance also in Asia and we had growth in North America. But the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle. The year prior was a good cycle. And 2 years before that were not great cycles. And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband. And that continues unabated. When do operators spend their money? On what do they spend their money? What are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using? Where are the content opportunities for us? Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis. But they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limits. And so our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system, maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly just to ultimately support the demands of the networks. And I think -- I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job. And I think the fact that we've seen now 2 quarters of strong performance really, indeed, accelerating performance, when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that."

I think if you go back, we had maybe a year where mil aero was a bit higher as a percent of sales. So it's not that 20% is a bright line. I think there is a level beyond which we wouldn't go. What is that? Is it 30%? Is it something like -- somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadth and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the markets. And so as we look an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers in this sort of almost re-architecting of the nature of the market. And I think that's just a great credit to the intramarket diversification that we have in IT datacom. But no, we're not putting the brakes on IT datacom. It doesn't change our investment strategy. It doesn't change our appetite for acquisitions or otherwise.

The team really also did really a nice job to diversify the business into really higher-margin products and maintain really a strong pricing discipline. I should also note that there was also some favorable impact from commodities. I think if you looked going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect the broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half. And as such, we would expect some moderation in the cable segment profitability based on kind of normal conversions.

We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries. And we continue to be just very excited about the space. In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still really reminds us of a bit like the interconnect market of a decade or 2 ago, very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you 2 thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment 2.5 years in. It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes. I mean, you have competition. You have technology change. You have programs that come and programs that go, very much like you have in the connector industry. And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders. And I think of all the value that we have brought by those 2 acquisitions that we've made so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business -- and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business, we had some in heavy equipment, we had some in medical. Well, you can imagine heavy equipment overall is a bit more of a challenging space. The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative, from a market share, the overall broad market for sensors, we still just have a very small position. And that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program."

I will provide so",1072,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name's Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.
We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $1,636,000,000, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73. Sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of '15.
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 5% organically.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable [ph] business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 14% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect [ph] business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 12% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
GAAP operating income and operating margin was $326 million and 19.9%, respectively. Adjusted operating income increased to $333 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was a new record at 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and 19.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The significant 90 basis points sequential improvement on operating margin reflects a particular -- in particular, the excellent progress in profitability made by the FCI [ph] management team, which they have achieved through the successful combination of their leading technology and the adoption of our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 12.5% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to the strong operating execution on the additional volume as well as the benefit from the favorable impact of commodities.
In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.2% compared to 22.3% last year and 21.2% last quarter. The significant sequential increase in the interconnect operating margins reflects the improvement in the FCI acquisition profitability I just mentioned as well as good operational execution on the additional volume.
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share during the third quarter. Interest expense for this quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs.
On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.9% and 26.5% for the third quarter of '16 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 included the effects of the $6 million of acquisition-related transaction expenses incurred, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 40 basis points.
Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the quarter, and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.71 and $0.65 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 and $0.65 in the third quarter of '16 and '15, respectively.
Orders for the quarter were a record $1,698,000,000, an 18% increase over the third quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $291 million in the third quarter or approximately 130% of net income.
For the 9 months, operating cash flow was $729 million or approximately 124% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of the quarter. Inventory days were 75, down 4 days compared to June.
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 2 days from June. Accounts payable was $651 million at the end of the quarter, and payable days were 53, down approximately 2 days compared to June.
The cash flow from operations of $291 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $128 million and stock option proceeds of $70 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately 121 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of approximately $87 million, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $192 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares. Approximately 1.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January of '17. And as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Directors had approved a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.14 to $0.16 per share, bringing the dividend yield to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January.
At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1,017,000,000, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, the company had issued $982 million under its commercial paper program.
The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3 billion, and net debt was approximately $2 billion, and the third quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $389 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and our current trends."

Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon.As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achieveme",2504,"Very good. Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon.
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and progress across our diversified served markets, and finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and of course, for the full year 2016.
I think Craig just went through the numbers, but I will just restate here that the third quarter was really an excellent quarter for the company. We established new records in orders, sales and EPS, all while reaching the highest level of profitability in the company's history. These achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy.
Revenue has increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reaching the new record of $1,636,000,000, and I think Craig mentioned that we booked record orders, nearly $1.7 billion, $1,698,000,000 in orders, which represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.04:1. 
We're particularly proud of our operating margins in the quarter, which reached the all-time high of 20.3%, up 90 basis points from the second quarter. As Craig alluded to, this margin expansion resulted from excellent operational execution, including continued progress in improving the performance of FCI.
Given [ph] [ph] this faster-than-expected margin expansion by the FCI team, we now expect the FCI acquisition to contribute $0.18 to our 2016 earnings per share. This compares to our prior outlook of $0.15 for the accretion this year.
I'd just tell you that we find it especially gratifying to see the benefits of the Amphenol management culture so clearly demonstrated in the performance of our new acquisitions.
Craig also mentioned our operating cash flow, which was a very robust $291 million, and that's just a clear sign of the continued quality of the company's earnings, and that has then been reflected with our Board of Directors approving a 14% increase in the company's dividend effective in the first quarter.
I will just say how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this organization's entrepreneurial agility has enabled the company to achieve strong performance amidst an uncertain and a very dynamic worldwide economy.
Our financial strength in the quarter also enabled us to make further progress in our acquisition program as we recently brought 2 new companies into the Amphenol family. All Systems Broadband, [ph] which we closed at the end of September, is a U.S.-based provider of high-technology value-add copper and fiber-optic interconnect solutions in particular for the broadband market. All Systems has annual sales of approximately $40 million. This company is a leader in particular for both consumer premises as well as important central office applications in support of high-speed data and video delivery for the broadband market, and it's really an exciting growth area for the company.
SGX Sensortech, [ph] which closed at the beginning of October, is a Switzerland-based supplier of air quality sensors with annual sales of approximately $15 million. SGX, which manufactures at its facility in Poland, is a provider of really high-technology air quality sensors that are used in both the automotive and the industrial markets. It's a real pleasure really to welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, our fourth and fifth acquisitions of the year. And going forward, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Turning to our progress across our various served markets. I just want to point out that in the third quarter, we continue to have an extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure with no single market representing more than 21% of our sales. I'll tell you this diversification is truly a valuable asset for Amphenol, especially in these very dynamic times.
The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased from prior year by 6%, driven by growth in naval, space, airframe and communications applications. I'd just say that this is really robust performance given the overall military spending environment as this was all organic growth.
Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% as we began to recover from the Defense Logistic Agency's [ph][ph] stop shipment order that we've discussed over the last couple of quarters. We are, in fact, very proud of the outstanding work of our military aerospace team, who has managed the recovery from the DLA's stop shipment so well. We're really fortunate actually to have forged outstanding long-term relationships with both our military customers as well as our distribution partners and have truly appreciated their patience and close collaboration during this challenging time.
In fact, our customers and partners have been extremely pleased with the agility and reactivity of our aerospace team, and it just again reaffirms our reputation as the leader in this important market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to again increase from these levels, and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, and that's even with the impact from the DLA issue.
Our long-term leadership position in the military market remains very strong as we continue to have the broadest range of high-technology products designed into virtually all defense equipment. We look forward to building upon this position of strength into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies from prior year as we realized stronger sales of our products designed into new airplane platforms.
As we had expected, sales were up moderately from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest increase in sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect sales to be flat to modestly up as the impact from the DLA issue, together with lower expected demand for helicopters and business jets, offsets the positive impact that we've seen from growing production volumes of new airplane platforms.
I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity in the commercial air market. With our strong technology position with airplane manufacturers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on and increasing volumes of new aircraft platform, we're very confident for the long term in this exciting market.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 22% from prior year. This growth was driven by contributions from the FCI and AUXEL [ph] acquisitions as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, heavy equipment and instrumentation segments, which were, in part, offset by slower sales in the oil and gas and rail mass transit. Organically, our sales in the quarter increased by 2%.
Sequentially, sales grew slightly as contributions from AUXEL were offset by a normal seasonal moderation of sales that we would typically see in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales in the industrial market to grow moderately from these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of exciting segments within the industrial market. We're continuing to build upon our successful diversified industrial business as we expand our high-technology interconnect sensor and antenna products across a broad array of industrial customers around the globe.
The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically as we made continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also accelerated our sales in Asia. Sales were up slightly from prior quarter on typical summer seasonality in the U.S. and Europe.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to grow from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. We continue to be excited by our long-term prospects in the automotive market as we are still making excellent progress in designing in our broadened range of interconnect sensors [ph] and antennas into new electronic systems incorporated into a wide array of vehicle platforms.
The acquisition of SGX, [ph] while relatively small, builds out our sensor product line for air quality applications, an important growth area for the automotive industry. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our strengthened position for many years to come.
The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down as expected by 22% from prior year on reduced sales into all categories of mobile devices with the notable exception of wearables. Sequentially, our sales rose by a strong 17% from the second quarter.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sales decline, and we continue to expect full year sales in the mobile devices market to decline by more than 10% from 2015. Regardless of the still challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market by capitalizing on our excellent technology positions across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. This was a bit stronger than expected as we again benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales of antennas and interconnect products to network operators, particularly in Europe. Our sales moderated slightly from the second quarter.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further moderation of sales due to typical year-end seasonality. Nevertheless, we continue to expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, will result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market.
Our strong performance in this market in 2016 is really a direct reflection of our team's unwavering drive to promote our leading technology interconnect and antenna products to OEMs as well as service providers around the world, and that's regardless of the normal ebbs and flows of wireless capital spending.
The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in IT datacom [ph] is much stronger than expected in the third quarter as sales grew 55% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 19% organically. This excellent performance was driven by contributions from FCI and Custom Cable [ph] as well as by robust organic growth in servers, storage and networking applications. And in particular, we accelerated our progress in selling into next-generation web service providers. Sales increased a very robust 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the second quarter.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase of sales from these higher levels. Given our much stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we now expect for the full year growth of more than 40%, which reflects the contributions of the FCI and Custom Cable acquisitions as well as approximately 10% organic growth.
I'll just say that our team focus on the important IT datacom market is clearly doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol as the leader with a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products. We continue to support our traditional and next-generation customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle the continued dramatic increases in data traffic.
The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that our sales increased from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as broadband operators continue to expand their network build-out activity to enable better network performance. Sales in this market were slightly down on a sequential basis.
For the fourth quarter, we expect an increase of sales with the addition of All Systems Broadband, and we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth in the broadband market for the full year of 2016. With the acquisition of ASB, we now have a broader offering of products used in both consumer premises as well as in the service provider and [ph] systems including, importantly, an array of value-add fiber-optic solutions. That newly expanded range of interconnect and cable products, together with our excellent position with broadband operators around the world, positions us very well for the long term.
So just in summary, I want to say that we're extremely proud of the company's outstanding record results here in the third quarter of 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our consistent dual-pronged strategy of driving organic growth while pursuing complementary acquisitions. And that strategy is enabling us to expand our market position while also strengthening the company's financial performance. And ultimately, the company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct, competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets around the world, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program as well as, most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year and based on a continuation of current global economic environment as well as assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,585,000,000 to $1,625,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of $0.11 to 13% and 13% to 16%, respectively.
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,220,000,000 to $6,260,000,000 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.68 to $2.70. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted EPS growth of 12% and 10% to 11%, respectively, over 2015 levels.
We are really encouraged by the company's strength and outlook now for 2016, and we all look forward to driving further success going forward despite the many dynamics in the global economy. I remain truly confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding management team to build upon these robust results and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond.
Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be happy to take any questions."

Adam, your operating margins were clearly outstanding here. Are we in an era where you can see that the de minimis price declines that you've historically seen in this connector industry actually stop and ASPs start to potentially rise, driving further margin upside because companies might be willing to pay for the high-performance connectivity that is needed to keep things from blowing up as all of us have heard about?

First, on your question on pricing, I wouldn't say that there is a new world order on pricing. I mean, this continues to be a very, very competitive market, a very competitive industry that's natural in an environment where you see commodity prices relatively lower and you see overall economic growth being relatively muted. And that's typically not an environment where you see a truly favorable pricing environment. So no doubt about it, our teams continue to do battle with competition. At the same time, as we've always said, if we can create value for our customers through technology, through service, through quality, through appropriate reactivity to their requirements for delivery and otherwise, well then, our customers will always pay us a reasonable and a fair price. And I think that's something that when we look across the company, our team is just doing an outstanding job of executing on all of those fronts. So it doesn't mean that there is some new pricing dynamic. I think what it means is that we're executing our way to those new higher levels of margins, and we're really proud of those margins. Ultimately, margins is just a very simple calculation, as I always say, of price minus cost, and embedded in that is all those things that we talked about. Now ultimately, what is the natural profitability of the business? I mean, we know what the profitability of the business was here in the third quarter. We achieved 20.3% operating margin. Is the natural profitability higher or lower than that? I don't know that that's something we ever, ever talked about. We always do talk about the fact though that as the company grows, we seek to drive conversion margins at a level that will allow us to achieve margin expansion, and we have continued to have a focus on those 25% conversion margins. And when you couple that with the strong execution with our acquisitions and in particular, with FCI, you get ultimately the performance that we saw this quarter."

And then the finance question for Craig is the coaxial [ph] business is hitting some pretty good operating profitability.

I mean, the team has really done a nice job to diversify this business into higher-margin products, which we certainly think has helped the profitability in this business and [ph] been able to maintain a strong pricing discipline.

So whether or not this is the norm going forward, it's tough to say with this commodity environment we're in here today.

And just with respect to your question on strategy and, specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back and those [ph] like you, Jim, who followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions has actually been very consistent for a long time. First and foremost, we think about the people, and we look for people who are strong entrepreneurs, who have great management talent because we don't have an organization necessarily that has lots of people sitting on the bench waiting to go run these acquisitions. So number one is the people. Number two is always the technology. We look for companies with really leading edge, valuable technology that can find -- that can allow their customers to drive better products ultimately, and then, thereby, allow us to make better returns. We also look for complementary market positions, and I think in the case of FCI, we had all 3 of those. What has never been our criteria for acquisitions, and continues not to be, is size. Now I will say it's no doubt about it, FCI was, in fact, the biggest acquisition that we've made in the history of the company, and we're very pleased so far with the results of that. Does that drive in us a greater level of confidence about making bigger acquisitions? I don't know that it changes our level of confidence. We had already a  pretty good confidence in the model, but I would say that it reconfirms that we believe that the acquisition strength of Amphenol, the program of Amphenol and the competency that we have is really a wonderful strength for the company, and it's a real pillar of the value that we create in addition to all the other things that we do to drive organic growth in the company. And so it certainly does not take away from the confidence. And if the right company came along at whatever size, we would be willing to look at that as long as it fit with those other criteria that we cling so importantly to."

I will tell you that I don't believe that the macro environment has largely changed this year. It remains relatively muted and uncertain, both geopolitically and economically. I think that if you look at just the various companies in the world that at least are public and the various markets that we serve, there's clearly not an overall trend of improvement. If you look at our company though in the third quarter, and you pointed it out very astutely here, Sherri. If you take the mobile devices, which is, no doubt about it, a significant decline on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude that, we grew by more than 7% organically in the quarter. And that is really a testament to the diversification of the company. Now you go back to last year, our mobile devices business was up 13%, and other parts of the business were not growing at that rate. And I think what you see is the consistency of the performance in light of the diversification of the business. It's true. This quarter, we had just fabulous performance from IT datacom, up 19% organically, 55% growth with the benefits of FCI and Custom Cable, and I think that that's just a fabulous performance. But also let's not forget that IT datacom had a few tough years. We've done maybe a bit better than the market. But if you look last year, we grew just 2% in IT datacom while maybe the overall market was down. Our team, despite that 2%, continued to drive aggressively with customers to expand our position, to develop new and appropriate products, to pivot towards where the growth opportunities and the potential growth opportunities could be, and we are able to realize the benefits of that here in the third quarter, and we expect to be able to do so for the total year 2016. But is that reflection of an improving IT datacom market or rather a reflection of our team really ferreting out where the growth is in an otherwise muted environment? I personally believe it's more of the latter than the former."

Or is the final kind of end target margin assumption of FCI heading up now that you've had it on your belt now for, I don't know, better part of 10 months?"

So on your first question, I don't think there was a real meaningful pull forward. We did maybe just a hair better in the third quarter than we had anticipated.

We did maybe just a hair better in the third quarter than we had anticipated. I think we've guided to a bit more than 10%. We ended up with 17%. It was plus or minus. But for the full year, we continue to see it as expected. So was there a slight pull forward? I mean, really ever so slight. The strength that we saw in the third quarter was really predominantly from IT datacom and then followed by mobile networks and broadband. We continue to have a similar view of the mobile devices market this year. We've talked about that quite a bit over the last -- in particular, at the last call, and we continue to have our team poised in case there are opportunities that come about. And sometimes those opportunities do come about, but you never know. It's an incredibly difficult market to forecast and an incredibly dynamic market, but we remain with a very, very strong position with customers across the board. Relative to your question on FCI just very simply, the revenue has been really at the expectations that we came into the year with. The improvement in the performance of FCI from an accretion perspective is really improved operating performance, and the team has just done an outstanding job really beyond our expectations, maybe not beyond our best wishes but certainly beyond our expectations coming into the year, and they continue to drive the company to a level of performance that I think none of them really thought would have seen in such a great fashion. And so we really commend them just on a fabulous, fabulous job."

So are there going to be ups and downs in that market over the coming years? I would bet that there would be ups and downs, but I think what's clear in this quarter is that we have positioned ourselves with the acquisition of FCI as well as with our organic initiatives to broaden our product offerings and to deepen the technology that we offer to customers. We have positioned ourselves as the clear leader in this space. There's no doubt about it, and so as we go to customers who are all struggling to deal with these increases in data rates, that demanding customers, the new dynamics that come with the web scale players and cloud computing and everything that is entailed with that, we become really the first phone call. And I think that that's a wonderful place to be in. So regardless of the ups and downs that may come in overall IT spending, we want to be the leader, and we want to be the first phone call, and we want to be the partner for next-generation designs, and that's what we have really become here. In terms of the web scale providers, I couldn't quote for you a number which tells you how much it is as a percent of the total, but I will tell you it's a really big part of why we're growing in such a fast pace. Is it all the growth? No, certainly not. There are also some really interesting companies that are growing around the world in that space, but it's clearly growing at much faster pace than our overall IT market, and it's starting to be meaningful part of our business.

Look, I'm not the expert on why certain companies are doing better or worse. I know that why we did better in the quarter, in particular, as we saw really stronger growth in our business and support directly of service providers, and we've talked about for a number of years the changing nature of the mobile networks market, where our business used to be really an OEM-focused business and really everything that we sold into the mobile networks market was really via those OEMs. And I think the dynamics in the market, the architecture of the system, the real makeup of the market has changed to a pretty big extent, whereby, service providers are now directly interacting with companies like us, where we're providing a broader range of products, including everything from antennas to a broad range of interconnect products and, whereby, we are not just rising and falling with the fate of necessarily the OEM. We continue to have very strong position with the OEMs, and we continue to support them really very closely and as partners that they are, but we have as well transitioned to having that direct interface with certain operators around the world. When you work directly with operators, it's also not necessarily for the faint of heart because this is a much more volatile business. I think that we have had to and our team has very successfully made the transition. We've really had to become more agile and more reactive because of the much quicker dynamics that come when you're putting crews out in the field and putting towers up on a relatively moment's notice. We saw particularly strength in mobile networks in Europe and in the service provider this last quarter. Is that going to continue? We had a similar picture, I guess, in the second quarter. What's that going to be in the fourth quarter going forward? I would expect it would change, but how is it going to change, what's the nature of that going to -- change going to be?

I guess, as it transitions more and more towards cloud and service provider, it becomes even more of a CapEx-driven market. I think there's no question that the demand on the network has never faltered whatsoever, and that's even over a few years of much more challenging market environments. And -- but what has not changed is the end-user demand, the data traffic, the video traffic going over IP networks, you name it. That is all expanding really, continuing at an accelerating pace. And so you do develop in certain points pent-up demand similar to what we have seen in years past in the mobile networks market, and I think we've even alluded to the fact that we believe in the IT market, there is some pent-up demand. But then the question comes and that's the company-specific question. Have you positioned yourself or repositioned yourself to take advantage of where that pent-up demand is going to come from? And I think that had one remained with just traditional customers, that pent-up demand would not be satisfied through those same channels, and you could find yourself really continuing to have a business that was in a more stable, almost languishing environment, and I think our team to their credit has truly pivoted, has truly pivoted towards where the demand and where the pent-up demand was building, where the real demand was coming and, thereby, we see that as a real relative strength of Amphenol in that market. I haven't seen and I don't think we've all seen yet all of the results that are coming in this area. There've been a few results that have been announced, and I think those are some ups and some downs. When all is said and done, maybe we will see that this is a more broad market environment.

As I mentioned, we grew 9% organically. We saw particular strength in Asia. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, and we've both made acquisitions and put a lot of focus in Asia on working with global and local companies in Asia in particular, in places like China, to make sure that we are positioned in what is really the world's now largest car market, and I think we're seeing some of the fruits of those labors. That was a very strong performance for us there. And if you look at our overall business today, it is roughly almost even across the various regions. Europe's maybe a bit more and then Asia and North America are roughly the same size, but that's a big change for the company. If we go back 7, 8 years, Europe would have been 2/3 of our business, and then the rest would have been North America and just a smidgen in Asia. And today, you see a real balanced automotive business, and I think that's both a representation of the market opportunity having changed but also of our organization having embraced that market opportunity. Specifically, what applications, what types of products? I can tell you that we've seen in our organic growth really across the board, across many applications. When we think about the automotive market, we don't think of that in terms of a unit of car market. We think about more in terms of a unit of systems in the car market, and so while you may have in the world 90 million, 92 million, 93 million cars being built, we think of that as some multiple of that in terms of how many electronic systems are being built in those cars and the total number of electronic systems, which ultimately, leads to the opportunity for Amphenol, has been growing at a wonderful pace. And then it rests on us to say, ""What can we capture through technologies such that we can get even a little bit more than our fair share of that?"" And that's the building blocks, ultimately, of this 9% organic growth. And, by the way, a continued positive outlook into next quarter. The fourth quarter, we still believe that there's a little bit of growth on a sequential basis, which is not always the case in the fourth quarter.

We've seen great progress in areas in heavy equipment, things like diesel engines, things like the transition of mechanical and hydraulic to electronics. So I think those, we've done very well in.

This is actually a strategy that we have had as a bedrock of Amphenol for a long, long time. It's really selling application-specific, value-add interconnect solutions to customers, where the underlying basis of that may very well be a very heavily designed component but where, in fact, the value-add solutions becomes highly integrated and designed in component for the customer. When we acquired the sensor business of GE, and that's now almost 3 years ago, we talked a lot about the fact that we felt that long term, that would create an opportunity for having integrated sensor and interconnect solutions for customers. And I can tell you that we have seen that, and we have started to see that, and we've started to see some positive momentum coming out of that, but it's not a new thing for us to go to a customer in automotive or industrial or any of our markets and work with them to propose a comprehensive interconnect solution for their product. On one hand, the customers really want it because they're all under pressure to accelerate their design process, to do more with less in many ways, reducing their own R&D spending such that they don't have to spec each of those little products. And in addition, it gives them a sense that they have ultimately, what I'd call before that one throat to choke, where rather than patch working together something, a solution, they can come to a company like Amphenol, and we can sell them really a complete interconnect solution, and they can feel the comfort that one company stands behind that whole solution from a quality perspective, from a cost-reduction perspective, from a delivery perspective, all the things that matter to those customers that gives them essentially the single throat to choke. And I think that the customers like that. It makes their life a lot easier. It makes it easier for them to design the products and ultimately, it makes it easier for them to sleep well at night knowing that they're going to be able to ship their products on a timely basis with the right quality. So I think that it's not a new strategy, but it continues to be core part of our strategy in automotive and in our other markets."

I'd tell you that organically, sensors are probably growing a bit better than our overall organic growth rate, and I think that's a real good thing. We came into the sensor market never with the statement that it will be a faster-growing space or more profitable space, but we think it's always has the potential to be at least as good as the rest of Amphenol, and I'd say that we were right about that sense. We see the sensor market as a truly diversified space, and so there are pockets in the sensors which are in some areas which aren't doing as well, and there are pockets in areas that are doing better, and that's a little bit of microcosm of all of Amphenol. You will remember, Brian, at the time we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors Business, for us, one of the most compelling things for that company was its diversification, the fact that it operated in industrial and within industrial operated across a number of different subsegments of the industrial market as well as operating in the automotive market. And we're really pleased that we have that diversified company because it's getting us also a picture of what the sensor demands are in those markets, so that we can then think about ourselves, our sensor strategy. And when we talk about the acquisition that we made in the quarter, it's a small acquisition, SGX, but there's no question that we saw in our activities in sensors, a real trend towards this requirement for air quality sensing applications, both in automotive and in industrial applications. And so when we found the right company, we were very eager to bring them into the Amphenol family to round out and to strengthen our technology position in sensors. So I think in a nutshell, we feel really good about it. I think it's performing better than the average across the company and continues to have great potential for us long term."

Obviously, our total mobile networks market grew very strongly in the quarter, in particular with the contributions from FCI.

I think the Steve Fox said earlier, do I love all of my children equally, and I do, indeed. The industrial market for Amphenol, as I mentioned earlier with Steve's question, it's a really broad market. We have a lot of position in a lot of different subsegments. I don't know that we are always the best canary in the coal mine for whether that is a positive or a negative trend in the overall industrial market. What I know is that our team is pretty good at ferreting out these opportunities as they may come. You don't think of an industrial team as being agile. It's almost by definition the opposite. You think of industrial as being the sort of staid, stable kind of an organization, slow life cycles, long design cycles, all of that. But I'll tell you, our industrial team is a pretty dynamic group of people, and so when they see things like oil and gas being down for now and it's running in the end of its second year a really tough performance, they don't just sit back and take their medicine. They go out, and they look for new opportunities to find growth wherever they may be. And I think the overall industrial market, if you think about just the biggest trend that is existing in broad industrial, it is this electronification of systems that previously would have been hydraulic and/or mechanic or nonexistent in their functionality. And I think that we see that really across all of the segments that we're in, and that is a question of just making sure that you have the right solutions, whether that be a discrete connector, a discrete sensor, an antenna, an integrated interconnect solution, an integrated sensor and connector solution, whatever it may be, you have to really make sure that you're tailoring your approach to that customer and you really knowing the customer, knowing the market. It's a very marketing-intensive business actually the industrial space because there's just so many potential customers across these dozens and dozens of subsegments, and staying on top of that and pivoting towards where the right segments are, that's really important. I know there are big industrial kind of giants in the industry, and they may have certain trends at one time or another, but I don't believe that we're necessarily a proxy for those trends."

I will provide so",1069,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name's Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.
We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $1,636,000,000, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73. Sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of '15.
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 5% organically.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 14% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 12% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
GAAP operating income and operating margin was $326 million and 19.9%, respectively. Adjusted operating income increased to $333 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was a new record at 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and 19.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The significant 90 basis points sequential improvement on operating margin reflects a particular -- in particular, the excellent progress in profitability made by the FCI management team, which they have achieved through the successful combination of their leading technology and the adoption of our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 12.5% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to the strong operating execution on the additional volume as well as the benefit from the favorable impact of commodities.
In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.2% compared to 22.3% last year and 21.2% last quarter. The significant sequential increase in the interconnect operating margins reflects the improvement in the FCI acquisition profitability I just mentioned as well as good operational execution on the additional volume.
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share during the third quarter. Interest expense for this quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs.
On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.9% and 26.5% for the third quarter of '16 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 included the effects of the $6 million of acquisition-related transaction expenses incurred, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 40 basis points.
Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the quarter, and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.71 and $0.65 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 and $0.65 in the third quarter of '16 and '15, respectively.
Orders for the quarter were a record $1,698,000,000, an 18% increase over the third quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $291 million in the third quarter or approximately 130% of net income.
For the 9 months, operating cash flow was $729 million or approximately 124% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of the quarter. Inventory days were 75, down 4 days compared to June.
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 2 days from June. Accounts payable was $651 million at the end of the quarter, and payable days were 53, down approximately 2 days compared to June.
The cash flow from operations of $291 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $128 million and stock option proceeds of $70 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately 121 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of approximately $87 million, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $192 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares. Approximately 1.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January of '17. And as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Directors had approved a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.14 to $0.16 per share, bringing the dividend yield to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January.
At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1,017,000,000, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, the company had issued $982 million under its commercial paper program.
The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3 billion, and net debt was approximately $2 billion, and the third quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $389 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and our current trends."

Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon.
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and progress across our diversified served markets, and finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and of course, for the full year 2016.
I think Craig just went through the numbers, but I will just restate here that the third quarter was really an excellent quarter for the company. We established new records in orders, sales and EPS, all while reaching the highest level of profitability in the company's history. These achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy.
Revenue has increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reaching the new record of $1,636,000,000, and I think Craig mentioned that we booked record orders, nearly $1.7 billion, $1,698,000,000 in orders, which represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.04:1. 
We're particularly proud of our operating margins in the quarter, which reached the all-time high of 20.3%, up 90 basis points from the second quarter. As Craig alluded to, this margin expansion resulted from excellent operational execution, including continued progress in improving the performance of FCI.
Given this faster-than-expected margin expansion by the FCI team, we now expect the FCI acquisition to contribute $0.18 to our 2016 earnings per share. This compares to our prior outlook of $0.15 for the accretion this year.
I'd just tell you that we find it especially gratifying to see the benefits of the Amphenol management culture so clearly demonstrated in the performance of our new acquisitions.
Craig also mentioned our operating cash flow, which was a very robust $291 million, and that's just a clear sign of the continued quality of the company's earnings, and that has then been reflected with our Board of Directors approving a 14% increase in the company's dividend effective in the first quarter.
I will just say how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this organization's entrepreneurial agility has enabled the company to achieve strong performance amidst an uncertain and a very dynamic worldwide economy.
Our financial strength in the quarter also enabled us to make further progress in our acquisition program as we recently brought 2 new companies into the Amphenol family. All Systems Broadband, which we closed at the end of September, is a U.S.-based provider of high-technology value-add copper and fiber-optic interconnect solutions in particular for the broadband market. All Systems has annual sales of approximately $40 million. This company is a leader in particular for both consumer premises as well as important central office applications in support of high-speed data and video delivery for the broadband market, and it's really an exciting growth area for the company.
SGX Sensortech, which closed at the beginning of October, is a Switzerland-based supplier of air quality sensors with annual sales of approximately $15 million. SGX, which manufactures at its facility in Poland, is a provider of really high-technology air quality sensors that are used in both the automotive and the industrial markets. It's a real pleasure really to welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, our fourth and fifth acquisitions of the year. And going forward, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Turning to our progress across our various served markets. I just want to point out that in the third quarter, we continue to have an extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure with no single market representing more than 21% of our sales. I'll tell you this diversification is truly a valuable asset for Amphenol, especially in these very dynamic times.
The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased from prior year by 6%, driven by growth in naval, space, airframe and communications applications. I'd just say that this is really robust performance given the overall military spending environment as this was all organic growth.
Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% as we began to recover from the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we've discussed over the last couple of quarters. We are, in fact, very proud of the outstanding work of our military aerospace team, who has managed the recovery from the DLA's stop shipment so well. We're really fortunate actually to have forged outstanding long-term relationships with both our military customers as well as our distribution partners and have truly appreciated their patience and close collaboration during this challenging time.
In fact, our customers and partners have been extremely pleased with the agility and reactivity of our aerospace team, and it just again reaffirms our reputation as the leader in this important market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to again increase from these levels, and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, and that's even with the impact from the DLA issue.
Our long-term leadership position in the military market remains very strong as we continue to have the broadest range of high-technology products designed into virtually all defense equipment. We look forward to building upon this position of strength into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies from prior year as we realized stronger sales of our products designed into new airplane platforms.
As we had expected, sales were up moderately from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest increase in sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect sales to be flat to modestly up as the impact from the DLA issue, together with lower expected demand for helicopters and business jets, offsets the positive impact that we've seen from growing production volumes of new airplane platforms.
I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity in the commercial air market. With our strong technology position with airplane manufacturers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on and increasing volumes of new aircraft platform, we're very confident for the long term in this exciting market.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 22% from prior year. This growth was driven by contributions from the FCI and AUXEL acquisitions as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, heavy equipment and instrumentation segments, which were, in part, offset by slower sales in the oil and gas and rail mass transit. Organically, our sales in the quarter increased by 2%.
Sequentially, sales grew slightly as contributions from AUXEL were offset by a normal seasonal moderation of sales that we would typically see in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales in the industrial market to grow moderately from these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of exciting segments within the industrial market. We're continuing to build upon our successful diversified industrial business as we expand our high-technology interconnect sensor and antenna products across a broad array of industrial customers around the globe.
The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically as we made continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also accelerated our sales in Asia. Sales were up slightly from prior quarter on typical summer seasonality in the U.S. and Europe.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to grow from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. We continue to be excited by our long-term prospects in the automotive market as we are still making excellent progress in designing in our broadened range of interconnect sensors and antennas into new electronic systems incorporated into a wide array of vehicle platforms.
The acquisition of SGX, while relatively small, builds out our sensor product line for air quality applications, an important growth area for the automotive industry. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our strengthened position for many years to come.
The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down as expected by 22% from prior year on reduced sales into all categories of mobile devices with the notable exception of wearables. Sequentially, our sales rose by a strong 17% from the second quarter.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sales decline, and we continue to expect full year sales in the mobile devices market to decline by more than 10% from 2015. Regardless of the still challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market by capitalizing on our excellent technology positions across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. This was a bit stronger than expected as we again benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales of antennas and interconnect products to network operators, particularly in Europe. Our sales moderated slightly from the second quarter.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further moderation of sales due to typical year-end seasonality. Nevertheless, we continue to expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, will result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market.
Our strong performance in this market in 2016 is really a direct reflection of our team's unwavering drive to promote our leading technology interconnect and antenna products to OEMs as well as service providers around the world, and that's regardless of the normal ebbs and flows of wireless capital spending.
The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in IT datacom is much stronger than expected in the third quarter as sales grew 55% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 19% organically. This excellent performance was driven by contributions from FCI and Custom Cable as well as by robust organic growth in servers, storage and networking applications. And in particular, we accelerated our progress in selling into next-generation web service providers. Sales increased a very robust 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the second quarter.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase of sales from these higher levels. Given our much stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we now expect for the full year growth of more than 40%, which reflects the contributions of the FCI and Custom Cable acquisitions as well as approximately 10% organic growth.
I'll just say that our team focus on the important IT datacom market is clearly doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol as the leader with a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products. We continue to support our traditional and next-generation customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle the continued dramatic increases in data traffic.
The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that our sales increased from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as broadband operators continue to expand their network build-out activity to enable better network performance. Sales in this market were slightly down on a sequential basis.
For the fourth quarter, we expect an increase of sales with the addition of All Systems Broadband, and we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth in the broadband market for the full year of 2016. With the acquisition of ASB, we now have a broader offering of products used in both consumer premises as well as in the service provider head-end systems including, importantly, an array of value-add fiber-optic solutions. That newly expanded range of interconnect and cable products, together with our excellent position with broadband operators around the world, positions us very well for the long term.
So just in summary, I want to say that we're extremely proud of the company's outstanding record results here in the third quarter of 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our consistent dual-pronged strategy of driving organic growth while pursuing complementary acquisitions. And that strategy is enabling us to expand our market position while also strengthening the company's financial performance. And ultimately, the company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct, competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets around the world, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program as well as, most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year and based on a continuation of current global economic environment as well as assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,585,000,000 to $1,625,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of $0.11 to 13% and 13% to 16%, respectively.
For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,220,000,000 to $6,260,000,000 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.68 to $2.70. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted EPS growth of 12% and 10% to 11%, respectively, over 2015 levels.
We are really encouraged by the company's strength and outlook now for 2016, and we all look forward to driving further success going forward despite the many dynamics in the global economy. I remain truly confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding management team to build upon these robust results and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond.
Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be happy to take any questions."

First, on your question on pricing, I wouldn't say that there is a new world order on pricing. I mean, this continues to be a very, very competitive market, a very competitive industry that's natural in an environment where you see commodity prices relatively lower and you see overall economic growth being relatively muted. And that's typically not an environment where you see a truly favorable pricing environment. So no doubt about it, our teams continue to do battle with competition. At the same time, as we've always said, if we can create value for our customers through technology, through service, through quality, through appropriate reactivity to their requirements for delivery and otherwise, well then, our customers will always pay us a reasonable and a fair price. And I think that's something that when we look across the company, our team is just doing an outstanding job of executing on all of those fronts. So it doesn't mean that there is some new pricing dynamic. I think what it means is that we're executing our way to those new higher levels of margins, and we're really proud of those margins. Ultimately, margins is just a very simple calculation, as I always say, of price minus cost, and embedded in that is all those things that we talked about. Now ultimately, what is the natural profitability of the business? I mean, we know what the profitability of the business was here in the third quarter. We achieved 20.3% operating margin. Is the natural profitability higher or lower than that? I don't know that that's something we ever, ever talked about. We always do talk about the fact though that as the company grows, we seek to drive conversion margins at a level that will allow us to achieve margin expansion, and we have continued to have a focus on those 25% conversion margins. And when you couple that with the strong execution with our acquisitions and in particular, with FCI, you get ultimately the performance that we saw this quarter."

And then the finance question for Craig is the coaxial business is hitting some pretty good operating profitability. I know it's due to volumes but also copper and aluminum prices have been favorable. Are those margins pretty sustainable? Or is there a point where the customers start asking to -- hey, copper and aluminum has come lower, therefore, they want to get some price back?

This 2.4-point increase from last year does really reflect the strong operating execution on the additional volume of the team. I mean, the segment grew over -- grew 14% over last year driven primarily by the broadband market. I mean, the team has really done a nice job to diversify this business into higher-margin products, which we certainly think has helped the profitability in this business and they being able to maintain a strong pricing discipline. Certainly, there's still pricing pressures within this business as there is with all our businesses, but they certainly been able to do a good job of changing a bit of the mix in this business that they try to increase it. But I will note, and I think you mentioned, that there has been certainly a favorable impact on commodities, and I would say if there was some significant change in the commodity pricing that we certainly have an impact on this particular business, which is a little bit more sensitive to commodities than even our interconnect business might be. So whether or not this is the norm going forward, it's tough to say with this commodity environment we're in here today. But certainly, they've done a great job, and we expect that this is certainly a new benchmark for them to build from."

And just with respect to your question on strategy and, specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back, and those like you, Jim, who followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions has actually been very consistent for a long time. First and foremost, we think about the people, and we look for people who are strong entrepreneurs, who have great management talent because we don't have an organization necessarily that has lots of people sitting on the bench waiting to go run these acquisitions. So number one is the people. Number two is always the technology. We look for companies with really leading edge, valuable technology that can find -- that can allow their customers to drive better products ultimately, and then, thereby, allow us to make better returns. We also look for complementary market positions, and I think in the case of FCI, we had all 3 of those. What has never been our criteria for acquisitions, and continues not to be, is size. Now I will say it's no doubt about it, FCI was, in fact, the biggest acquisition that we've made in the history of the company, and we're very pleased so far with the results of that. Does that drive in us a greater level of confidence about making bigger acquisitions? I don't know that it changes our level of confidence. We had already a  pretty good confidence in the model, but I would say that it reconfirms that we believe that the acquisition strength of Amphenol, the program of Amphenol and the competency that we have is really a wonderful strength for the company, and it's a real pillar of the value that we create in addition to all the other things that we do to drive organic growth in the company. And so it certainly does not take away from the confidence. And if the right company came along at whatever size, we would be willing to look at that as long as it fit with those other criteria that we cling so importantly to."

I will tell you that I don't believe that the macro environment has largely changed this year. It remains relatively muted and uncertain, both geopolitically and economically. I think that if you look at just the various companies in the world that at least are public and the various markets that we serve, there's clearly not an overall trend of improvement. If you look at our company though in the third quarter, and you pointed it out very astutely here, Sherri. If you take the mobile devices, which is, no doubt about it, a significant decline on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude that, we grew by more than 7% organically in the quarter. And that is really a testament to the diversification of the company. Now you go back to last year, our mobile devices business was up 13%, and other parts of the business were not growing at that rate. And I think what you see is the consistency of the performance in light of the diversification of the business. It's true. This quarter, we had just fabulous performance from IT datacom, up 19% organically, 55% growth with the benefits of FCI and Custom Cable, and I think that that's just a fabulous performance. But also let's not forget that IT datacom had a few tough years. We've done maybe a bit better than the market. But if you look last year, we grew just 2% in IT datacom while maybe the overall market was down. Our team, despite that 2%, continued to drive aggressively with customers to expand our position, to develop new and appropriate products, to pivot towards where the growth opportunities and the potential growth opportunities could be, and we are able to realize the benefits of that here in the third quarter, and we expect to be able to do so for the total year 2016. But is that reflection of an improving IT datacom market or rather a reflection of our team really ferreting out where the growth is in an otherwise muted environment? I personally believe it's more of the latter than the former."

But for the full year, we continue to see it as expected. So was there a slight pull forward? I mean, really ever so slight. The strength that we saw in the third quarter was really predominantly from IT datacom and then followed by mobile networks and broadband. We continue to have a similar view of the mobile devices market this year. We've talked about that quite a bit over the last -- in particular, at the last call, and we continue to have our team poised in case there are opportunities that come about. And sometimes those opportunities do come about, but you never know. It's an incredibly difficult market to forecast and an incredibly dynamic market, but we remain with a very, very strong position with customers across the board. Relative to your question on FCI just very simply, the revenue has been really at the expectations that we came into the year with. The improvement in the performance of FCI from an accretion perspective is really improved operating performance, and the team has just done an outstanding job really beyond our expectations, maybe not beyond our best wishes but certainly beyond our expectations coming into the year, and they continue to drive the company to a level of performance that I think none of them really thought would have seen in such a great fashion.

Look, I mean, I'm not the expert on why certain companies are doing better or worse. I know that why we did better in the quarter in particular is we saw really stronger growth in our business in support directly of service providers. And we've talked about for a number of years the changing nature of the mobile networks market, where our business used to be really an OEM-focused business and really everything that we sold into the mobile networks market was really via those OEMs. And I think the dynamics in the market, the architecture of the system, the real makeup of the market has changed to a pretty big extent, whereby service providers are now directly interacting with companies like us, where we're providing a broader range of products, including everything from antennas to a broad range of interconnect products and whereby we are not just rising and falling with the fate of necessarily the OEM. We continue to have a very strong position with the OEMs, and we continue to support them really very closely and as partners that they are, but we have as well transitioned to having that direct interface with certain operators around the world. When you work directly with operators, it's also not necessarily for the faint of heart because this is a much more volatile business. I think that we have had to and our team has very successfully made that  transition. We've really had to become more agile and more reactive because of the much quicker dynamics that come when you're putting crews out in the field and putting towers up on relatively moment's notice. We saw particularly strength in mobile networks in Europe and in the service provider this last quarter. Is that going to continue? We had a similar picture, I guess, in the second quarter. What's that going to be in the fourth quarter going forward? I would expect it would change. But how is it going to change, what's the nature of that going to -- change going to be? I think it's a little too early to tell at this point."

First, on the network data and IT, where you're seeing the better-than-expected results that you called out. I'm just curious on your thoughts when I think about the weak macro environment that you speak about, I typically think about markets typically being more CapEx-reliant or more confidence-driven. And I appreciate your thoughts that you'd said a lot of this is Amphenol-specific, but I'm also seeing it across other companies exposed to that end market.

I guess, as it transitions more and more towards cloud and service provider, it becomes even more of a CapEx-driven market. I think there's no question that the demand on the network has never faltered whatsoever, and that's even over a few years of much more challenging market environments. And -- but what has not changed is the end-user demand, the data traffic, the video traffic going over IP networks, you name it. That is all expanding really, continuing at an accelerating pace. And so you do develop, in certain points, pent-up demand. Pent-up demand similar to what we have seen in years past in the mobile networks market. And I think we've even alluded to the fact that we believe in the IT market, there is some pent-up demand. But then the question comes, and that's the company-specific question. Have you positioned yourself or repositioned yourself to take advantage of where that pent-up demand is going to come from? And I think that had one remained with just traditional customers, that pent-up demand would not be satisfied through those same channels, and you could find yourself really continuing to have a business that was in a more stable, almost languishing environment. And I think our team, to their credit, has truly pivoted. Has truly pivoted towards where the demand and where the pent-up demand was building and where the real demand was coming. And thereby, we see that as a real relative strength of Amphenol in that market. I haven't seen and I don't think we've all seen yet all of the results that are coming in this area. There've been a few results that have been announced, and I think those are some ups and some downs. When all is said and done, maybe we will see that this is a more broad market environment. But is that going to be a 19% organic growth? That, I would be -- I would guess we would not see on a broad basis."

As I mentioned, we grew 9% organically. We saw particular strength in Asia. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, and we've both made acquisitions and put a lot of focus in Asia on working with global and local companies in Asia in particular, in places like China, to make sure that we're positioned in what is really the world's now largest car market, and I think we're seeing some of the fruits of those labors . That was a very strong performance for us there. And if you look at our overall business today, it is roughly almost even across the various regions. Europe's maybe a bit more and then Asia and North America are roughly the same size, but that's a big change for the company. If we go back 7, 8 years, Europe would have been 2/3 of our business, and then the rest would have been North America and just a smidgen in Asia. And today, you see a real balanced automotive business, and I think that's both a representation of the market opportunity having changed but also of our organization having embraced that market opportunity. Specifically, what applications, what types of products? I can tell you that we've seen in our organic growth really across the board, across many applications. When we think about the automotive market, we don't think of that in terms of a unit of car market. We think of that more in terms of unit of systems in the car market, and so while you may have in the world 90 million, 92 million, 93 million cars being built, we think of that as some multiple of that in terms of how many electronic systems are being built in those cars and the total number of electronic systems, which ultimately leads to the opportunity for Amphenol, has been growing at a wonderful pace. And then it rests on us to say, ""What can we capture through technologies such that we can get even a little bit more than our fair share of that?"" And that's the building blocks, ultimately, of this 9% organic growth and, by the way, a continued positive outlook into next quarter. The fourth quarter, we still believe that there's a little bit of growth on a sequential basis, which is not always the case in the fourth quarter. So I think we have good momentum in our auto business sitting here where we are."

I'm not going to be the first one to predict the turnaround of oil and gas. I think we've had really strong momentum in battery applications and, really, heavy vehicles, and we -- I think we would expect that to have still some legs to it. We've done really well in places like in heavy equipment, which is maybe a little bit contrary to the broader market environment. We've seen great progress in areas in heavy equipment, things like diesel engines, things like the transition of mechanical and hydraulic to electronics. So I think those, we've done very well in. We feel good about our medical business. Even if the medical business didn't necessarily grow so substantially in the quarter, we've made just great progress in medical over the course of the year, and we feel really good about that. I think the others, there's big segments here like factory automation and instrumentation.

I think our team is really focused on taking orders off the street and that's -- there's an aggressiveness with the company, where we know that you can't ship anything if you don't have an order. And getting those orders requires you to develop the new products, to get the design in with the  customers, and ultimately then, that leads finally to the sales. I think we had a very strong book-to-bill, which is encouraging. Some of our businesses are on a very short book-to-bill cycle. You take like the mobile business, that's not a -- that's a business where you book and ship really almost at the same time, and we have other businesses like military, where you have a little bit longer cycle. And I think we had some -- we had here good bookings. We had actually pretty good bookings in the IT datacom market, not surprisingly given our performance there. And I think that the trend from bookings to me, the fact that we had that strong book-to-bill is encouraging for the very long term, and it's encouraging for the fact that our customers are willing to commit to us on the new products and with the new technologies that we give them.

This is actually a strategy that we have had as a bedrock of Amphenol for a long, long time. It's really selling application-specific, value-add interconnect solutions to customers, where the underlying basis of that may very well be a very highly designed component but where, in fact, the value-add solutions becomes the highly integrated and designed in component for the customer. When we acquired the sensor business of GE, and that's now almost 3 years ago, we talked a lot about the fact that we felt that long term, that would create an opportunity for having integrated sensor and interconnect solutions for customers. And I can tell you that we have seen that, and we have started to see that, and we've started to see some positive momentum coming out of that, but it's not a new thing for us to go to a customer in automotive or industrial or any of our markets and work with them to propose a comprehensive interconnect solution for their product. On one hand, the customers really want it because they're all under pressure to accelerate their design process, to do more with less, in many ways reducing their own R&D spending such that they don't have to spec each of those little products. And in addition, it gives them a sense that they have ultimately what I've called before that one throat to choke, where rather than patch working together something, a solution, they can come to a company like Amphenol, and we can sell them really a complete interconnect solution, and they can feel the comfort that one company stands behind that whole solution from a quality perspective, from a cost-reduction perspective, from a delivery perspective, all the things that matter to those customers that gives them essentially the single throat to choke. And I think that the customers like that. It makes their life a lot easier. It makes it easier for them to design the products, and ultimately, it makes it easier for them to sleep well at night knowing that they're going to be able to ship their products on a timely basis with the right quality. So I think that it's not a new strategy, but it continues to be a core part of our strategy in automotive and in our other markets."

We see the sensor market as a truly diversified space, and so there are pockets in the sensors which are -- in some areas which aren't doing as well, and there are pockets in areas that are doing better, and that's a little bit a microcosm of all of Amphenol. You will remember, Brian, at the time we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors Business, for us, one of the most compelling things for that company was its diversification, the fact that it operated in industrial and, within industrial, operated across a number of different subsegments of the industrial market as well as operating in the automotive market. And we're really pleased that we have that diversified company because it's getting us also a picture of what the sensor demands are in those markets, so that we can then think about ourselves our sensor strategy. And when we talk about the acquisition that we made in the quarter, it's a small acquisition, SGX, but there's no question that we saw in our activities in sensors a real trend towards this requirement for air quality sensing applications, both in automotive and in industrial applications. And so when we found the right company, we were very eager to bring them into the Amphenol family to round out and to strengthen our technology position in sensors. So I think in a nutshell, we feel really good about it. I think it's performing better than the average across the company and continues to have great potential for us long term."

You think of industrial as being the sort of staid, stable kind of an organization, slow life cycles, long design cycles, all of that. But I'll tell you, our industrial team is a pretty dynamic group of people, and so when they see things like oil and gas being down for now and it's running in the end of its second year a really tough performance, they don't just sit back and take their medicine. They go out, and they look for new opportunities to find growth wherever they may be. And I think the overall industrial market, if you think about just the biggest trend that is existing in broad industrial, it is this electronification of systems that previously would have been hydraulic and/or mechanic or nonexistent in their functionality. And I think that we see that really across all of the segments that we're in, and that is a question of just making sure that you have the right solutions, whether that be a discrete connector, a discrete sensor, an antenna, an integrated interconnect solution, an integrated sensor and connector solution, whatever it may be, you have to really make sure that you're tailoring your approach to that customer and you're really knowing the customer, knowing the market. It's a very marketing-intensive business actually, the industrial space, because there's just so many potential customers across these dozens and dozens of subsegments, and staying on top of that and pivoting towards where the right segments are, that's really important.

I will provide som",1068,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name's Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $1,636,000,000, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73. Sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of '15. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 5% organically.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 14% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 12% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
GAAP operating income and operating margin was $326 million and 19.9%, respectively. Adjusted operating income increased to $333 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was a new record at 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and 19.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The significant 90 basis points sequential improvement on operating margin reflects a particular -- in particular, the excellent progress in profitability made by the FCI management team, which they have achieved through the successful combination of their leading technology and the adoption of our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 12.5% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to the strong operating execution on the additional volume as well as the benefit from the favorable impact of commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.2% compared to 22.3% last year and 21.2% last quarter. The significant sequential increase in the interconnect operating margins reflects the improvement in the FCI acquisition profitability I just mentioned as well as good operational execution on the additional volume.
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share during the third quarter. Interest expense for this quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.9% and 26.5% for the third quarter of '16 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 included the effects of the $6 million of acquisition-related transaction expenses incurred, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 40 basis points.
Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the quarter, and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.71 and $0.65 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 and $0.65 in the third quarter of '16 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were a record $1,698,000,000, an 18% increase over the third quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $291 million in the third quarter or approximately 130% of net income. For the 9 months, operating cash flow was $729 million or approximately 124% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of the quarter. Inventory days were 75, down 4 days compared to June.
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 2 days from June. Accounts payable was $651 million at the end of the quarter, and payable days were 53, down approximately 2 days compared to June.
The cash flow from operations of $291 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $128 million and stock option proceeds of $70 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $121 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of approximately $87 million, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $192 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares. Approximately 1.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January of '17. And as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Directors had approved a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.14 to $0.16 per share, bringing the dividend yield to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January.
At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1,017,000,000, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, the company had issued $982 million under its commercial paper program. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3 billion, and net debt was approximately $2 billion, and the third quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $389 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievemen",2492,"Very good. Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and progress across our diversified served markets, and finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and of course, for the full year 2016.
I think Craig just went through the numbers, but I will just restate here that the third quarter was really an excellent quarter for the company. We established new records in orders, sales and EPS, all while reaching the highest level of profitability in the company's history. These achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Revenue has increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reaching the new record of $1,636,000,000, and I think Craig mentioned that we booked record orders, nearly $1.7 billion, $1,698,000,000 in orders, which represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.04:1. 
We're particularly proud of our operating margins in the quarter, which reached the all-time high of 20.3%, up 90 basis points from the second quarter. As Craig alluded to, this margin expansion resulted from excellent operational execution, including continued progress in improving the performance of FCI. Given this faster-than-expected margin expansion by the FCI team, we now expect the FCI acquisition to contribute $0.18 to our 2016 earnings per share. This compares to our prior outlook of $0.15 for the accretion this year. I'd just tell you that we find it especially gratifying to see the benefits of the Amphenol management culture so clearly demonstrated in the performance of our new acquisition.
Craig also mentioned our operating cash flow, which was a very robust $291 million, and that's just a clear sign of the continued quality of the company's earnings, and that has then been reflected with our Board of Directors approving a 14% increase in the company's dividend effective in the first quarter. I will just say how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this organization's entrepreneurial agility has enabled the company to achieve strong performance amidst an uncertain and a very dynamic worldwide economy.
Our financial strength in the quarter also enabled us to make further progress in our acquisition program, as we recently brought 2 new companies into the Amphenol family. All Systems Broadband, which we closed at the end of September, is a U.S.-based provider of high-technology value-add copper and fiber-optic interconnect solutions, in particular for the broadband market. All Systems has annual sales of approximately $40 million. This company is a leader in particular for both consumer premises as well as important central office applications in support of high-speed data and video delivery for the broadband market, and it's really an exciting growth area for the company.
SGX Sensortech, which closed at the beginning of October, is a Switzerland-based supplier of air quality sensors with annual sales of approximately $15 million. SGX, which manufactures at its facility in Poland, is a provider of really high-technology air quality sensors that are used in both the automotive and the industrial markets. It's a real pleasure really to welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, our fourth and fifth acquisitions of the year. And going forward, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Turning to our progress across our various served markets. I just want to point out that in the third quarter, we continue to have an extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure with no single market representing more than 21% of our sales. I'll tell you this diversification is truly a valuable asset for Amphenol, especially in these very dynamic times. The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased from prior year by 6%, driven by growth in naval, space, airframe and communications applications. I'd just say that this is really robust performance given the overall military spending environment as this was all organic growth.
Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% as we began to recover from the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we've discussed over the last couple of quarters. We are, in fact, very proud of the outstanding work of our military aerospace team, who has managed the recovery from the DLA's stop ship so well. We're really fortunate actually to have forged outstanding long-term relationships with both our military customers as well as our distribution partners and have truly appreciated their patience and close collaboration during this challenging time.
In fact, our customers and partners have been extremely pleased with the agility and reactivity of our aerospace team, and it just again reaffirms our reputation as the leader in this important market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to again increase from these levels, and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, and that's even with the impact from the DLA issue. Our long-term leadership position in the military market remains very strong as we continue to have the broadest range of high-technology products designed into virtually all defense equipment. We look forward to building upon this position of strength into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies from prior year, as we realized stronger sales of our products designed into new airplane platforms. As we'd expected, sales were up moderately from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest increase in sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect sales to be flat to modestly up as the impact from the DLA issue, together with lower expected demand for helicopters and business jets, offsets the positive impact that we've seen from growing production volumes of new airplane platforms.
I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity in the commercial air market. With our strong technology position with airplane manufacturers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on and increasing volumes of new aircraft platforms, we're very confident for the long term in this exciting market.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 22% from prior year. This growth was driven by contributions from the FCI and AUXEL acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, heavy equipment and instrumentation segment, which were, in part, offset by slower sales in the oil and gas and rail mass transit. Organically, our sales in the quarter increased by 2%.
Sequentially, sales grew slightly as contributions from AUXEL were offset by a normal seasonal moderation of sales that we would typically see in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales in the industrial market to grow moderately from these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of exciting segments within the industrial market. We're continuing to build upon our successful diversified industrial business as we expand our high-technology interconnect sensor and antenna products across a broad array of industrial customers around the globe.
The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, as we made continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also accelerated our sales in Asia. Sales were up slightly from prior quarter on typical summer seasonality in the U.S. and Europe. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to grow from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. 
We continue to be excited by our long-term prospects in the automotive market as we are still making excellent progress in designing in our broadened range of interconnect sensors and antennas into new electronic systems incorporated into a wide array of vehicle platforms. The acquisition of SGX, while relatively small, builds out our sensor product line for air quality applications, an important growth area for the automotive industry. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our strengthened position for many years to come.
The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down as expected by 22% from prior year on reduced sales into all categories of mobile devices with the notable exception of wearables. Sequentially, our sales rose by a strong 17% from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sales decline, and we continue to expect full year sales in the mobile devices market to decline by more than 10% from 2015. Regardless of this still challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market by capitalizing on our excellent technology positions across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. This was a bit stronger than expected as we again benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales of antennas and interconnect products to network operators, particularly in Europe. Our sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further moderation of sales due to typical year-end seasonality. Nevertheless, we continue to expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, will result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market.
Our strong performance in this market in 2016 is really a direct reflection of our team's unwavering drive to promote our leading technology interconnect and antenna products to OEMs as well as service providers around the world, and that's regardless of the normal ebbs and flows of wireless capital spending.
The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in IT datacom was much stronger than expected in the third quarter as sales grew 55% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 19% organically. This excellent performance was driven by contributions from FCI and Custom Cable, as well as by robust organic growth in servers, storage and networking applications. And in particular, we accelerated our progress in selling into next-generation web service providers. Sales increased a very robust 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the second quarter.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase of sales from these higher levels. Given our much stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we now expect for the full year growth of more than 40%, which reflects the contributions of the FCI and Custom Cable acquisitions as well as approximately 10% organic growth. I'll just say that our team focus on the important IT datacom market is clearly doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol as the leader with a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products. We continue to support our traditional and next-generation customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle the continued dramatic increases in data traffic.
The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that our sales increased from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as broadband operators continue to expand their network buildout activity to enable better network performance. Sales in this market were slightly down on a sequential basis.
For the fourth quarter, we expect an increase of sales with the addition of All Systems Broadband, and we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth in the broadband market for the full year of 2016. With the acquisition of ASB, we now have a broader offering of products used in both consumer premises as well as in the service provider head-end systems including, importantly, an array of value-add fiber-optic solutions. That newly expanded range of interconnect and cable products, together with our excellent position with broadband operators around the world, positions us very well for the long term.
So just in summary, I want to say that we're extremely proud of the company's outstanding record results here in the third quarter of 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our consistent dual-pronged strategy of driving organic growth while pursuing complementary acquisitions. And that strategy is enabling us to expand our market position while also strengthening the company's financial performance. And ultimately, the company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets around the world, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program as well as, most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year and based on a continuation of current global economic environment as well as assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,585,000,000 to $1,625,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 11% to 13% and 13% to 16%, respectively. For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,220,000,000 to $6,260,000,000 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.68 to $2.70. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted EPS growth of 12% and 10% to 11%, respectively, over 2015 levels.
We are really encouraged by the company's strength and outlook now for 2016, and we all look forward to driving further success going forward despite the many dynamics in the global economy. I remain truly confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding management team to build upon these robust results and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond.
Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be happy to take any questions."

First, on your question on pricing, I wouldn't say that there is a new world order on pricing. I mean, this continues to be a very, very competitive market, a very competitive industry that's natural in an environment where you see commodity prices relatively lower and you see overall economic growth being relatively muted. And that's typically not an environment where you see a truly favorable pricing environment. So no doubt about it, our teams continue to do battle with competition. At the same time, as we've always said, if we can create value for our customers through technology, through service, through quality, through appropriate reactivity to their requirements for delivery and otherwise, well then, our customers will always pay us a reasonable and a fair price. And I think that's something that when we look across the company, our team is just doing an outstanding job of executing on all of those fronts. So it doesn't mean that there is some new pricing dynamic. I think what it means is that we're executing our way to those new higher levels of margins, and we're really proud of those margins. And ultimately, margins is just a very simple calculation, as I always say, of price minus cost, and embedded in that is all those things that we talked about. Now ultimately, what is the natural profitability of the business? I mean, we know what the profitability of the business was here in the third quarter. We achieved 20.3% operating margin. Is the natural profitability higher or lower than that? I don't know that that's something we have ever talked about. We always do talk about the fact though that as the company grows, we seek to drive conversion margins at a level that will allow us to achieve margin expansion, and we have continued to have a focus on those 25% conversion margins. And when you couple that with the strong execution with our acquisitions and in particular, with FCI, you get ultimately the performance that we saw this quarter."

And then the finance question for Craig is the coaxial business is hitting some pretty good operating profitability. I know it's due to volumes but also copper and aluminum prices have been favorable. Are those margins pretty sustainable? Or is there a point where the customers start asking to -- hey, copper and aluminum has come lower, therefore, they want to give some price backs?

This 2.4 point increase from last year does really reflect the strong operating execution on the additional volume of the team. I mean, the segment grew over -- grew 14% over last year driven primarily by the broadband market. I mean, the team's really done a nice job to diversify this business into higher-margin products, which we certainly think has helped the profitability in this business and they being able to maintain a strong pricing discipline. Certainly, there's still pricing pressures within this business as there is with all our businesses, but they've certainly been able to do a good job of changing a bit of the mix in this business that they try to increase it. But I will note, and I think you mentioned, that there has been certainly a favorable impact on commodities, and I would say if there was some significant change in the commodity pricing that we'd certainly have an impact on this particular business, which is a little bit more sensitive to commodities than even our interconnect business might be. So whether or not this is the norm going forward, it's tough to say with this commodity environment we're in here today. But certainly, they've done a great job, and we expect that this is certainly a new benchmark for them to build from."

And just with respect to your question on strategy and, specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back, and those like you, Jim, who have followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions",352,"Absolutely. And just with respect to your question on strategy and, specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back, and those like you, Jim, who have followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions has actually been very consistent for a long time. First and foremost, we think about the people, and we look for people who are strong entrepreneurs, who have great management talent because we don't have an organization necessarily that has lots of people sitting on the bench waiting to go run these acquisitions. So number one is the people. Number two is always the technology. We look for companies with really leading edge, valuable technology that can find -- that can allow their customers to drive better products ultimately, and then, thereby, allow us to make better returns. We also look for complementary market positions, and I think in the case of FCI, we had all 3 of those. What has never been our criteria for acquisitions, and continues not to be, is size. Now I will say it's no doubt about it, FCI was, in fact, the biggest acquisition that we've made in the history of the company, and we're very pleased so far with the results of that. Does that drive in us a greater level of confidence about making bigger acquisitions? I don't know that it changes our level of confidence. We had already a pretty good confidence in the model, but I would say that it reconfirms that we believe that the acquisition strength of Amphenol, the program of Amphenol and the competency that we have is really a wonderful strength for the company, and it's a real pillar of the value that we create in addition to all the other things that we do to drive organic growth in the company. And so it certainly does not take away from the confidence. And if the right company came along at whatever size, we would be willing to look at that as long as it fit with those other criteria that we cling so importantly to."

I will tell you that I don't believe that the macro environment has largely changed this year. It remains relatively muted and uncertain, both geopolitically and economically. I think that if you look at just the various companies in the world that at least are public and the various markets that we serve, there's clearly not an overall trend of improvement. If you look at our company, though, in the third quarter, and you pointed it out very astutely here, Sherri. If you take the mobile devices, which is, no doubt about it, a significant decline on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude that, we grew by more than 7% organically in the quarter. And that is really a testament to the diversification of the company. Now you go back to last year, our mobile devices business was up 13%, and other parts of the business were not growing at that rate. And I think what you see is the consistency of the performance in light of the diversification of the business. It's true. This quarter, we had just fabulous performance from IT datacom, up 19% organically, 55% growth with the benefits of FCI and Custom Cable, and I think that that's just a fabulous performance. But also let's not forget that IT Datacom has had a few tough years. We've done maybe a bit better than the market. But if you look last year, we grew just 2% in IT datacom while maybe the overall market was down. Our team, despite that 2%, continued to drive aggressively with customers to expand our position, to develop the new and appropriate products, to pivot towards where the growth opportunities and the potential growth opportunities could be, and we were able to realize the benefits of that here in the third quarter, and we expect to be able to do so for the total year 2016. But is that a reflection of an improving IT datacom market or rather a reflection of our team really ferreting out where the growth is in an otherwise muted environment? I personally believe it's more of the latter than the former."

We did maybe just a hair better in the third quarter than we had anticipated. I think we guided to a bit more than 10%. We ended up with 17%. It was plus or minus. But for the full year, we continue to see it as expected. So was there a slight pull forward? I mean, really ever so slight. The strength that we saw in the third quarter was really predominantly from IT datacom and then followed by mobile networks and broadband. We continue to have a similar view of the mobile devices market this year. We've talked about that quite a bit over the last -- in particular, at the last call, and we continue to have our team poised in case there are opportunities that come about. And sometimes those opportunities do come about, but you never know. It's an incredibly difficult market to forecast and an incredibly dynamic market, but we remain with a very, very strong position with customers across the board. Relative to your question on FCI just very simply, the revenue has been really at the expectations that we came into the year with. The improvement in the performance of FCI from an accretion perspective is really improved operating performance, and the team has just done an outstanding job, really beyond our expectations, maybe not beyond our best wishes but certainly beyond our expectations coming into the year, and they continue to drive the company to a level of performance that I think none of them really thought would have seen in such a great fashion. And so we really commend them just on a fabulous, fabulous job."

So are there going to be ups and downs in that market over the coming years? I would bet that there would be ups and downs, but I think what's clear in this quarter is that we have positioned ourselves, with the acquisition of FCI as well as with our organic initiatives, to broaden our product offering and to deepen the technology that we offer to customers. We have positioned ourselves as the clear leader in this space. There's no doubt about it. And so as we go to customers who are all struggling to deal with these increases in data rates, demanding customer, the new dynamics that come with the web scale players and cloud computing and everything that is entailed with that, we become really the first phone call.

Look, I mean, I'm not the expert on why certain companies are doing better or worse. I know that why we did better in the quarter in particular is we saw really stronger growth in our business in support directly of service providers. And we've talked about for a number of years the changing nature of the mobile networks market, where our business used to be really an OEM-focused business and really everything that we sold into the mobile networks market was really via those OEMs. And I think the dynamics in the market, the architecture of the system, the real makeup of the market has changed to a pretty big extent, whereby service providers are now directly interacting with companies like us, where we're providing a broader range of products, including everything from antennas to a broad range of interconnect products and whereby we are not just rising and falling with the fate of necessarily the OEM. We continue to have a very strong position with the OEMs, and we continue to support them really very closely and as partners that they are, but we have as well transitioned to having that direct interface with certain operators around the world. When you work directly with operators, it's also not necessarily for the faint of heart because this is a much more volatile business. I think that we have had to and our team has very successfully made that transition. We've really had to become more agile and more reactive because of the much quicker dynamics that come when you're putting crews out in the field and putting towers up on relatively moment's notice. We saw particularly strength in mobile networks in Europe and in the service provider this last quarter. Is that going to continue? We had a similar picture, I guess, in the second quarter. What's that going to be in the fourth quarter going forward? I would expect it would change. But how is it going to change, what's the nature of that going to -- change going to be?

I guess, as it transitions more and more towards cloud and service provider, it becomes even more of a CapEx-driven market. I think there's no question that the demand on the network has never faltered whatsoever, and that's even over a few years of much more challenging market environments. And -- but what has not changed is the end-user demand, the data traffic, the video traffic going over IP networks, you name it. That is all expanding really, continuing at an accelerating pace. And so you do develop, in certain points, pent-up demand. Pent-up demand similar to what we have seen in years past in the mobile networks market. And I think we've even alluded to the fact that we believe in the IT market, there is some pent-up demand. But then the question comes, and that's the company-specific question. Have you positioned yourself or repositioned yourself to take advantage of where that pent-up demand is going to come from? And I think that had one remained with just traditional customers, that pent-up demand would not be satisfied through those same channels, and you could find yourself really continuing to have a business that was in a more stable, almost languishing environment. And I think our team, to their credit, has truly pivoted. Has truly pivoted towards where the demand and where the pent-up demand was building and where the real demand was coming. And thereby, we see that as a real relative strength of Amphenol in that market. I haven't seen and I don't think we've all seen yet all of the results that are coming in this area. There've been a few results that have been announced, and I think those are some ups and some downs. When all is said and done, maybe we will see that this is a more broad market environment.

As I mentioned, we grew 9% organically. We saw particular strength in Asia. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, and we've both made acquisitions and put a lot of focus in Asia on working with global and local companies in Asia in particular, in places like China, to make sure that we're positioned in what is really the world's now largest car market, and I think we're seeing some of the fruits of those labors. That was a very strong performance for us there. And if you look at our overall business today, it is roughly almost even across the various regions. Europe's maybe a bit more and then Asia and North America are roughly the same size, but that's a big change for the company. If we go back 7, 8 years, Europe would have been 2/3 of our business, and then the rest would have been North America and just a smidgen in Asia. And today, you see a real balanced automotive business, and I think that's both a representation of the market opportunity having changed but also of our organization having embraced that market opportunity. Specifically, what applications, what types of products? I can tell you that we've seen in our organic growth really across the board, across many applications. When we think about the automotive market, we don't think of that in terms of a unit of car market. We think of that more in terms of unit of systems in the car market. And so while you may have in the world 90 million, 92 million, 93 million cars being built, we think of that as some multiple of that in terms of how many electronic systems are being built in those cars and the total number of electronic systems, which ultimately leads to the opportunity for Amphenol, has been growing at a wonderful pace. And then it rests on us to say, ""What can we capture through technology such that we can get even a little bit more than our fair share of that?"" And that's the building blocks, ultimately, of this 9% organic growth and, by the way, a continued positive outlook into next quarter. The fourth quarter, we still believe that there's a little bit of growth on a sequential basis, which is not always the case in the fourth quarter.

I think we've had really strong momentum in battery applications in really heavy vehicles, and we -- I think we would expect that to have still some legs to it. We've done really well in places like in heavy equipment, which is maybe a little bit contrary to the broader market environment. We've seen great progress in areas in heavy equipment, things like diesel engines, things like the transition of mechanical and hydraulic to electronics. So I think those, we've done very well in. We feel good about our medical business. Even if the medical business didn't necessarily grow so substantially in the quarter, we've made just great progress in medical over the course of the year, and we feel really good about that. I think the others, there's big segments here like factory automation and instrumentation. Our team has just done a fabulous job of positioning a broader set of products in those areas such that we can get more involved in things like robots and more involved in things like factory control systems, and I think that those have good opportunities for the future as well."

I think our team is really focused on taking orders off the street and that's -- there's an aggressiveness with the company, where we know that you can't ship anything if you don't have an order. And getting those orders requires you to develop the new product, to get the design in with the customers, and ultimately then, that leads finally to the sales. I think we had a very strong book-to-bill, which is encouraging. Some of our businesses are on a very short book-to-bill cycle. You take like the mobile business, that's not a -- that's a business where you book and ship really almost at the same time, and we have other businesses like military, where you have a little bit longer cycle. And I think we had some -- we had here good bookings. We had actually pretty good bookings in the IT datacom market, not surprisingly given our performance there. And I think that the trend from bookings to me, the fact that we had that strong book-to-bill is encouraging for the very long term, and it's encouraging for the fact that our customers are willing to commit to us on the new products and with the new technologies that we give them. But I wouldn't -- I don't read a macro inflection point necessarily because of those bookings if that's what your question is."

This is actually a strategy that we have had as a bedrock of Amphenol for a long, long time. It's really selling application-specific, value-add interconnect solutions to customers, where the underlying basis of that may very well be a very highly designed component but where, in fact, the value-add solution becomes the highly integrated and designed in component for the customer. When we acquired the sensor business of GE, and that's now almost 3 years ago, we talked a lot about the fact that we felt that long term, that would create an opportunity for having integrated sensor and interconnect solutions for customers. And I can tell you that we have seen that, and we have started to see that, and we've started to see some positive momentum coming out of that. But it's not a new thing for us to go to a customer in automotive or industrial or any of our markets and work with them to propose a comprehensive interconnect solution for their product. On one hand, the customers really want it because they're all under pressure to accelerate their design process, to do more with less, in many ways reducing their own R&D spending such that they don't have to spec each of those little products. And in addition, it gives them a sense that they have ultimately what I've called before that one throat to choke, where rather than patch working together something, a solution, they can come to a company like Amphenol, and we can sell them really a complete interconnect solution, and they can feel the comfort that one company stands behind that whole solution from a quality perspective, from a cost-reduction perspective, from a delivery perspective, all the things that matter to those customer that gives them essentially the single throat to choke. And I think that the customers like that. It makes their life a lot easier. It makes it easier for them to design the product, and ultimately, it makes it easier for them to sleep well at night knowing that they're going to be able to ship their products on a timely basis with the right quality. So I think that it's not a new strategy, but it continues to be a core part of our strategy in automotive and in our other markets."

We came into the sensor market never with the statement that it will be a faster-growing space or more profitable space, but we think it always has the potential to be at least as good as the rest of Amphenol, and I'd say that we were right about that sense. We see the sensor market as a truly diversified space, and so there are pockets in the sensors which are -- in some areas which aren't doing as well, and there are pockets in areas that are doing better, and that's a little bit a microcosm of all of Amphenol. You will remember, Brian, at the time we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors Business, for us, one of the most compelling things for that company was its diversification, the fact that it operated in industrial and, within industrial, it operated across a number of different subsegments of the industrial market as well as operating in the automotive market. And we're really pleased that we have that diversified company because it's getting us also a picture of what the sensor demands are in those markets, so that we can then think about ourselves, our sensor strategy. And when we talk about the acquisition that we made in the quarter, it's a small acquisition, SGX, but there's no question that we saw in our activities in sensors a real trend towards this requirement for air quality sensing application, both in automotive and in industrial applications. And so when we found the right company, we were very eager to bring them into the Amphenol family to round out and to strengthen our technology position in sensors. So I think in a nutshell, we feel really good about it. I think it's performing better than the average across the company and continues to have great potential for us long term."

Obviously, our total mobile networks market grew very strongly in the quarter, in particular with the contributions from FCI.

I don't know that we are always the best canary in the coal mine for whether that is a positive or a negative trend in the overall industrial market. What I know is that our team is pretty good at ferreting out these opportunities as they may come. You don't think of an industrial team as being agile. It's almost by definition the opposite. You think of industrial as being the sort of staid, stable kind of an organization, slow life cycles, long design cycles, all of that. But I'll tell you, our industrial team is a pretty dynamic group of people, and so when they see things like oil and gas being down for now and it's running in the end of its second year  of really tough performance, they don't just sit back and take their medicine. They go out, and they look for new opportunities to find growth wherever they may be. And I think the overall industrial market, if you think about just the biggest trend that is existing in broad industrial, it is this electronification of systems that previously would have been hydraulic and/or mechanic or nonexistent in their functionality. And I think that we see that really across all of the segments that we're in, and then it's a question of just making sure that you have the right solutions, whether that be a discrete connector, a discrete sensor, an antenna, an integrated interconnect solution, an integrated sensor and connector solution, whatever it may be, you have to really make sure that you're tailoring your approach to that customer and you're really knowing the customer and knowing the market. It's a very marketing-intensive business actually, the industrial space, because there's just so many potential customers across these dozens and dozens of subsegments, and staying on top of that and pivoting towards where the right segments are, that's really important. I know there are big industrial kind of giants in the industry, and they may have certain trends at one time or another, but I don't believe that we're necessarily a proxy for those trends."

We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.
We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $1,636,000,000, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73. Sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of '15. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 5% organically.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. Our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 14% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 12% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
GAAP operating income and operating margin was $326 million and 19.9%, respectively. Adjusted operating income increased to $333 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was a new record at 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and 19.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The significant 90 basis points sequential improvement on operating margin reflects a particular -- in particular, the excellent progress in profitability made by the FCI management team, which they have achieved through the successful combination of their leading technology and the adoption of our strong operating discipline.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 12.5% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to the strong operating execution on the additional volume as well as the benefit from the favorable impact of commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.2% compared to 22.3% last year and 21.2% last quarter. The significant sequential increase in the interconnect operating margins reflects the improvement in the FCI acquisition profitability I just mentioned as well as good operational execution on the additional volume.
We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.
The company has recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share during the third quarter. Interest expense for this quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.9% and 26.5% for the third quarter of '16 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 included the effects of the $6 million of acquisition-related transaction expenses incurred, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 40 basis points.
Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the quarter, and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.71 and $0.65 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 and $0.65 in the third quarter of '16 and '15, respectively. Orders for the quarter were a record $1,698,000,000, an 18% increase over the third quarter of '15, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $291 million in the third quarter or approximately 130% of net income. For the 9 months, operating cash flow was $729 million or approximately 124% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of the quarter. Inventory days were 75, down 4 days compared to June.
Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 2 days from June. Accounts payable was $651 million at the end of the quarter, and payable days were 53, down approximately 2 days compared to June.
The cash flow from operations of $291 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $128 million and stock option proceeds of $70 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $121 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of approximately $87 million, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $192 million net of translation.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares. Approximately 1.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January of '17. And as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Directors had approved a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.14 to $0.16 per share, bringing the dividend yield to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January.
At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1,017,000,000, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, the company had issued $982 million under its commercial paper program. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3 billion, and net debt was approximately $2 billion, and the third quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $389 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.
Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends."

As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievemen",2492,"Very good. Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss the trends and progress across our diversified served markets, and finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and of course, for the full year 2016.
I think Craig just went through the numbers, but I will just restate here that the third quarter was really an excellent quarter for the company. We established new records in orders, sales and EPS, all while reaching the highest level of profitability in the company's history. These achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Revenue has increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reaching the new record of $1,636,000,000, and I think Craig mentioned that we booked record orders, nearly $1.7 billion, $1,698,000,000 in orders, which represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.04:1. 
We're particularly proud of our operating margins in the quarter, which reached the all-time high of 20.3%, up 90 basis points from the second quarter. As Craig alluded to, this margin expansion resulted from excellent operational execution, including continued progress in improving the performance of FCI. Given this faster-than-expected margin expansion by the FCI team, we now expect the FCI acquisition to contribute $0.18 to our 2016 earnings per share. This compares to our prior outlook of $0.15 for the accretion this year. I'd just tell you that we find it especially gratifying to see the benefits of the Amphenol management culture so clearly demonstrated in the performance of our new acquisition.
Craig also mentioned our operating cash flow, which was a very robust $291 million, and that's just a clear sign of the continued quality of the company's earnings, and that has then been reflected with our Board of Directors approving a 14% increase in the company's dividend effective in the first quarter. I will just say how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this organization's entrepreneurial agility has enabled the company to achieve strong performance amidst an uncertain and a very dynamic worldwide economy.
Our financial strength in the quarter also enabled us to make further progress in our acquisition program, as we recently brought 2 new companies into the Amphenol family. All Systems Broadband, which we closed at the end of September, is a U.S.-based provider of high-technology value-add copper and fiber-optic interconnect solutions, in particular for the broadband market. All Systems has annual sales of approximately $40 million. This company is a leader in particular for both consumer premises as well as important central office applications in support of high-speed data and video delivery for the broadband market, and it's really an exciting growth area for the company.
SGX Sensortech, which closed at the beginning of October, is a Switzerland-based supplier of air quality sensors with annual sales of approximately $15 million. SGX, which manufactures at its facility in Poland, is a provider of really high-technology air quality sensors that are used in both the automotive and the industrial markets. It's a real pleasure really to welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, our fourth and fifth acquisitions of the year. And going forward, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Turning to our progress across our various served markets. I just want to point out that in the third quarter, we continue to have an extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure with no single market representing more than 21% of our sales. I'll tell you this diversification is truly a valuable asset for Amphenol, especially in these very dynamic times. The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased from prior year by 6%, driven by growth in naval, space, airframe and communications applications. I'd just say that this is really robust performance given the overall military spending environment as this was all organic growth.
Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% as we began to recover from the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we've discussed over the last couple of quarters. We are, in fact, very proud of the outstanding work of our military aerospace team, who has managed the recovery from the DLA's stop ship so well. We're really fortunate actually to have forged outstanding long-term relationships with both our military customers as well as our distribution partners and have truly appreciated their patience and close collaboration during this challenging time.
In fact, our customers and partners have been extremely pleased with the agility and reactivity of our aerospace team, and it just again reaffirms our reputation as the leader in this important market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to again increase from these levels, and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, and that's even with the impact from the DLA issue. Our long-term leadership position in the military market remains very strong as we continue to have the broadest range of high-technology products designed into virtually all defense equipment. We look forward to building upon this position of strength into the future.
The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies from prior year, as we realized stronger sales of our products designed into new airplane platforms. As we'd expected, sales were up moderately from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest increase in sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect sales to be flat to modestly up as the impact from the DLA issue, together with lower expected demand for helicopters and business jets, offsets the positive impact that we've seen from growing production volumes of new airplane platforms.
I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity in the commercial air market. With our strong technology position with airplane manufacturers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on and increasing volumes of new aircraft platforms, we're very confident for the long term in this exciting market.
The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 22% from prior year. This growth was driven by contributions from the FCI and AUXEL acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, heavy equipment and instrumentation segment, which were, in part, offset by slower sales in the oil and gas and rail mass transit. Organically, our sales in the quarter increased by 2%.
Sequentially, sales grew slightly as contributions from AUXEL were offset by a normal seasonal moderation of sales that we would typically see in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales in the industrial market to grow moderately from these levels, and we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of exciting segments within the industrial market. We're continuing to build upon our successful diversified industrial business as we expand our high-technology interconnect sensor and antenna products across a broad array of industrial customers around the globe.
The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, as we made continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also accelerated our sales in Asia. Sales were up slightly from prior quarter on typical summer seasonality in the U.S. and Europe. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to grow from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. 
We continue to be excited by our long-term prospects in the automotive market as we are still making excellent progress in designing in our broadened range of interconnect sensors and antennas into new electronic systems incorporated into a wide array of vehicle platforms. The acquisition of SGX, while relatively small, builds out our sensor product line for air quality applications, an important growth area for the automotive industry. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our strengthened position for many years to come.
The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down as expected by 22% from prior year on reduced sales into all categories of mobile devices with the notable exception of wearables. Sequentially, our sales rose by a strong 17% from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sales decline, and we continue to expect full year sales in the mobile devices market to decline by more than 10% from 2015. Regardless of this still challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market by capitalizing on our excellent technology positions across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms.
The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. This was a bit stronger than expected as we again benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales of antennas and interconnect products to network operators, particularly in Europe. Our sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further moderation of sales due to typical year-end seasonality. Nevertheless, we continue to expect to achieve low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, will result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market.
Our strong performance in this market in 2016 is really a direct reflection of our team's unwavering drive to promote our leading technology interconnect and antenna products to OEMs as well as service providers around the world, and that's regardless of the normal ebbs and flows of wireless capital spending.
The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in IT datacom was much stronger than expected in the third quarter as sales grew 55% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 19% organically. This excellent performance was driven by contributions from FCI and Custom Cable, as well as by robust organic growth in servers, storage and networking applications. And in particular, we accelerated our progress in selling into next-generation web service providers. Sales increased a very robust 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the second quarter.
Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase of sales from these higher levels. Given our much stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we now expect for the full year growth of more than 40%, which reflects the contributions of the FCI and Custom Cable acquisitions as well as approximately 10% organic growth. I'll just say that our team focus on the important IT datacom market is clearly doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol as the leader with a broad range of customers with the widest array of high-technology products. We continue to support our traditional and next-generation customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle the continued dramatic increases in data traffic.
The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that our sales increased from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as broadband operators continue to expand their network buildout activity to enable better network performance. Sales in this market were slightly down on a sequential basis.
For the fourth quarter, we expect an increase of sales with the addition of All Systems Broadband, and we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth in the broadband market for the full year of 2016. With the acquisition of ASB, we now have a broader offering of products used in both consumer premises as well as in the service provider head-end systems including, importantly, an array of value-add fiber-optic solutions. That newly expanded range of interconnect and cable products, together with our excellent position with broadband operators around the world, positions us very well for the long term.
So just in summary, I want to say that we're extremely proud of the company's outstanding record results here in the third quarter of 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our consistent dual-pronged strategy of driving organic growth while pursuing complementary acquisitions. And that strategy is enabling us to expand our market position while also strengthening the company's financial performance. And ultimately, the company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets around the world, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program as well as, most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year and based on a continuation of current global economic environment as well as assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,585,000,000 to $1,625,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 11% to 13% and 13% to 16%, respectively. For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6,220,000,000 to $6,260,000,000 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.68 to $2.70. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted EPS growth of 12% and 10% to 11%, respectively, over 2015 levels.
We are really encouraged by the company's strength and outlook now for 2016, and we all look forward to driving further success going forward despite the many dynamics in the global economy. I remain truly confident in the ability of Amphenol's outstanding management team to build upon these robust results and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond.
Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be happy to take any questions."

First, on your question on pricing, I wouldn't say that there is a new world order on pricing. I mean, this continues to be a very, very competitive market, a very competitive industry that's natural in an environment where you see commodity prices relatively lower and you see overall economic growth being relatively muted. And that's typically not an environment where you see a truly favorable pricing environment. So no doubt about it, our teams continue to do battle with competition. At the same time, as we've always said, if we can create value for our customers through technology, through service, through quality, through appropriate reactivity to their requirements for delivery and otherwise, well then, our customers will always pay us a reasonable and a fair price. And I think that's something that when we look across the company, our team is just doing an outstanding job of executing on all of those fronts. So it doesn't mean that there is some new pricing dynamic. I think what it means is that we're executing our way to those new higher levels of margins, and we're really proud of those margins. And ultimately, margins is just a very simple calculation, as I always say, of price minus cost, and embedded in that is all those things that we talked about. Now ultimately, what is the natural profitability of the business? I mean, we know what the profitability of the business was here in the third quarter. We achieved 20.3% operating margin. Is the natural profitability higher or lower than that? I don't know that that's something we have ever talked about. We always do talk about the fact though that as the company grows, we seek to drive conversion margins at a level that will allow us to achieve margin expansion, and we have continued to have a focus on those 25% conversion margins. And when you couple that with the strong execution with our acquisitions and in particular, with FCI, you get ultimately the performance that we saw this quarter."

And if that's true, and it's progressing well, does that give you more confidence that maybe bigger acquisitions are kind of the way to go? Or how should we think about that? And then the finance question for Craig is the coaxial business is hitting some pretty good operating profitability. I know it's due to volumes but also copper and aluminum prices have been favorable. Are those margins pretty sustainable? Or is there a point where the customers start asking to -- hey, copper and aluminum has come lower, therefore, they want to give some price backs?

This 2.4 point increase from last year does really reflect the strong operating execution on the additional volume of the team. I mean, the segment grew over -- grew 14% over last year driven primarily by the broadband market. I mean, the team's really done a nice job to diversify this business into higher-margin products, which we certainly think has helped the profitability in this business and they being able to maintain a strong pricing discipline. Certainly, there's still pricing pressures within this business as there is with all our businesses, but they've certainly been able to do a good job of changing a bit of the mix in this business that they try to increase it. But I will note, and I think you mentioned, that there has been certainly a favorable impact on commodities, and I would say if there was some significant change in the commodity pricing that we'd certainly have an impact on this particular business, which is a little bit more sensitive to commodities than even our interconnect business might be. So whether or not this is the norm going forward, it's tough to say with this commodity environment we're in here today. But certainly, they've done a great job, and we expect that this is certainly a new benchmark for them to build from."

And just with respect to your question on strategy and, specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back, and those like you, Jim, who have followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions has actually been very consistent for a long time. First and foremost, we think about the people, and we look for people who are strong entrepreneurs, who have great management talent because we don't have an organization necessarily that has lots of people sitting on the bench waiting to go run these acquisitions. So number one is the people. Number two is always the technology. We look for companies with really leading edge, valuable technology that can find -- that can allow their customers to drive better products ultimately, and then, thereby, allow us to make better returns. We also look for complementary market positions, and I think in the case of FCI, we had all 3 of those. What has never been our criteria for acquisitions, and continues not to be, is size. Now I will say it's no doubt about it, FCI was, in fact, the biggest acquisition that we've made in the history of the company, and we're very pleased so far with the results of that. Does that drive in us a greater level of confidence about making bigger acquisitions? I don't know that it changes our level of confidence. We had already a pretty good confidence in the model, but I would say that it reconfirms that we believe that the acquisition strength of Amphenol, the program of Amphenol and the competency that we have is really a wonderful strength for the company, and it's a real pillar of the value that we create in addition to all the other things that we do to drive organic growth in the company. And so it certainly does not take away from the confidence. And if the right company came along at whatever size, we would be willing to look at that as long as it fit with those other criteria that we cling so importantly to."

I will tell you that I don't believe that the macro environment has largely changed this year. It remains relatively muted and uncertain, both geopolitically and economically. I think that if you look at just the various companies in the world that at least are public and the various markets that we serve, there's clearly not an overall trend of improvement. If you look at our company, though, in the third quarter, and you pointed it out very astutely here, Sherri. If you take the mobile devices, which is, no doubt about it, a significant decline on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude that, we grew by more than 7% organically in the quarter. And that is really a testament to the diversification of the company. Now you go back to last year, our mobile devices business was up 13%, and other parts of the business were not growing at that rate. And I think what you see is the consistency of the performance in light of the diversification of the business. It's true. This quarter, we had just fabulous performance from IT datacom, up 19% organically, 55% growth with the benefits of FCI and Custom Cable, and I think that that's just a fabulous performance. But also let's not forget that IT Datacom has had a few tough years. We've done maybe a bit better than the market. But if you look last year, we grew just 2% in IT datacom while maybe the overall market was down. Our team, despite that 2%, continued to drive aggressively with customers to expand our position, to develop the new and appropriate products, to pivot towards where the growth opportunities and the potential growth opportunities could be, and we were able to realize the benefits of that here in the third quarter, and we expect to be able to do so for the total year 2016. But is that a reflection of an improving IT datacom market or rather a reflection of our team really ferreting out where the growth is in an otherwise muted environment? I personally believe it's more of the latter than the former."

But for the full year, we continue to see it as expected. So was there a slight pull forward? I mean, really ever so slight. The strength that we saw in the third quarter was really predominantly from IT datacom and then followed by mobile networks and broadband. We continue to have a similar view of the mobile devices market this year. We've talked about that quite a bit over the last -- in particular, at the last call, and we continue to have our team poised in case there are opportunities that come about. And sometimes those opportunities do come about, but you never know. It's an incredibly difficult market to forecast and an incredibly dynamic market, but we remain with a very, very strong position with customers across the board. Relative to your question on FCI just very simply, the revenue has been really at the expectations that we came into the year with. The improvement in the performance of FCI from an accretion perspective is really improved operating performance, and the team has just done an outstanding job, really beyond our expectations, maybe not beyond our best wishes but certainly beyond our expectations coming into the year, and they continue to drive the company to a level of performance that I think none of them really thought would have seen in such a great fashion.

We have positioned ourselves as the clear leader in this space. There's no doubt about it. And so as we go to customers who are all struggling to deal with these increases in data rates, demanding customer, the new dynamics that come with the web scale players and cloud computing and everything that is entailed with that, we become really the first phone call.

Look, I mean, I'm not the expert on why certain companies are doing better or worse. I know that why we did better in the quarter in particular is we saw really stronger growth in our business in support directly of service providers. And we've talked about for a number of years the changing nature of the mobile networks market, where our business used to be really an OEM-focused business and really everything that we sold into the mobile networks market was really via those OEMs. And I think the dynamics in the market, the architecture of the system, the real makeup of the market has changed to a pretty big extent, whereby service providers are now directly interacting with companies like us, where we're providing a broader range of products, including everything from antennas to a broad range of interconnect products and whereby we are not just rising and falling with the fate of necessarily the OEM. We continue to have a very strong position with the OEMs, and we continue to support them really very closely and as partners that they are, but we have as well transitioned to having that direct interface with certain operators around the world. When you work directly with operators, it's also not necessarily for the faint of heart because this is a much more volatile business. I think that we have had to and our team has very successfully made that transition. We've really had to become more agile and more reactive because of the much quicker dynamics that come when you're putting crews out in the field and putting towers up on relatively moment's notice. We saw particularly strength in mobile networks in Europe and in the service provider this last quarter. Is that going to continue? We had a similar picture, I guess, in the second quarter. What's that going to be in the fourth quarter going forward? I would expect it would change. But how is it going to change, what's the nature of that going to -- change going to be? I think it's a little too early to tell at this point."

I guess, as it transitions more and more towards cloud and service provider, it becomes even more of a CapEx-driven market. I think there's no question that the demand on the network has never faltered whatsoever, and that's even over a few years of much more challenging market environments. And -- but what has not changed is the end-user demand, the data traffic, the video traffic going over IP networks, you name it. That is all expanding really, continuing at an accelerating pace. And so you do develop, in certain points, pent-up demand. Pent-up demand similar to what we have seen in years past in the mobile networks market. And I think we've even alluded to the fact that we believe in the IT market, there is some pent-up demand. But then the question comes, and that's the company-specific question. Have you positioned yourself or repositioned yourself to take advantage of where that pent-up demand is going to come from? And I think that had one remained with just traditional customers, that pent-up demand would not be satisfied through those same channels, and you could find yourself really continuing to have a business that was in a more stable, almost languishing environment. And I think our team, to their credit, has truly pivoted. Has truly pivoted towards where the demand and where the pent-up demand was building and where the real demand was coming. And thereby, we see that as a real relative strength of Amphenol in that market. I haven't seen and I don't think we've all seen yet all of the results that are coming in this area. There've been a few results that have been announced, and I think those are some ups and some downs. When all is said and done, maybe we will see that this is a more broad market environment. But is that going to be a 19% organic growth? That, I would be -- I would guess we would not see on a broad basis."

As I mentioned, we grew 9% organically. We saw particular strength in Asia. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, and we've both made acquisitions and put a lot of focus in Asia on working with global and local companies in Asia in particular, in places like China, to make sure that we're positioned in what is really the world's now largest car market, and I think we're seeing some of the fruits of those labors. That was a very strong performance for us there. And if you look at our overall business today, it is roughly almost even across the various regions. Europe's maybe a bit more and then Asia and North America are roughly the same size, but that's a big change for the company. If we go back 7, 8 years, Europe would have been 2/3 of our business, and then the rest would have been North America and just a smidgen in Asia. And today, you see a real balanced automotive business, and I think that's both a representation of the market opportunity having changed but also of our organization having embraced that market opportunity. Specifically, what applications, what types of products? I can tell you that we've seen in our organic growth really across the board, across many applications. When we think about the automotive market, we don't think of that in terms of a unit of car market. We think of that more in terms of unit of systems in the car market. And so while you may have in the world 90 million, 92 million, 93 million cars being built, we think of that as some multiple of that in terms of how many electronic systems are being built in those cars and the total number of electronic systems, which ultimately leads to the opportunity for Amphenol, has been growing at a wonderful pace. And then it rests on us to say, ""What can we capture through technology such that we can get even a little bit more than our fair share of that?"" And that's the building blocks, ultimately, of this 9% organic growth and, by the way, a continued positive outlook into next quarter. The fourth quarter, we still believe that there's a little bit of growth on a sequential basis, which is not always the case in the fourth quarter. So I think we have good momentum in our auto business sitting here where we are."

We've done really well in places like in heavy equipment, which is maybe a little bit contrary to the broader market environment. We've seen great progress in areas in heavy equipment, things like diesel engines, things like the transition of mechanical and hydraulic to electronics. So I think those, we've done very well in.

You take like the mobile business, that's not a -- that's a business where you book and ship really almost at the same time, and we have other businesses like military, where you have a little bit longer cycle.

This is actually a strategy that we have had as a bedrock of Amphenol for a long, long time. It's really selling application-specific, value-add interconnect solutions to customers, where the underlying basis of that may very well be a very highly designed component but where, in fact, the value-add solution becomes the highly integrated and designed in component for the customer. When we acquired the sensor business of GE, and that's now almost 3 years ago, we talked a lot about the fact that we felt that long term, that would create an opportunity for having integrated sensor and interconnect solutions for customers. And I can tell you that we have seen that, and we have started to see that, and we've started to see some positive momentum coming out of that. But it's not a new thing for us to go to a customer in automotive or industrial or any of our markets and work with them to propose a comprehensive interconnect solution for their product. On one hand, the customers really want it because they're all under pressure to accelerate their design process, to do more with less, in many ways reducing their own R&D spending such that they don't have to spec each of those little products. And in addition, it gives them a sense that they have ultimately what I've called before that one throat to choke, where rather than patch working together something, a solution, they can come to a company like Amphenol, and we can sell them really a complete interconnect solution, and they can feel the comfort that one company stands behind that whole solution from a quality perspective, from a cost-reduction perspective, from a delivery perspective, all the things that matter to those customer that gives them essentially the single throat to choke. And I think that the customers like that. It makes their life a lot easier. It makes it easier for them to design the product, and ultimately, it makes it easier for them to sleep well at night knowing that they're going to be able to ship their products on a timely basis with the right quality. So I think that it's not a new strategy, but it continues to be a core part of our strategy in automotive and in our other markets."

We see the sensor market as a truly diversified space, and so there are pockets in the sensors which are -- in some areas which aren't doing as well, and there are pockets in areas that are doing better, and that's a little bit a microcosm of all of Amphenol. You will remember, Brian, at the time we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors Business, for us, one of the most compelling things for that company was its diversification, the fact that it operated in industrial and, within industrial, it operated across a number of different subsegments of the industrial market as well as operating in the automotive market. And we're really pleased that we have that diversified company because it's getting us also a picture of what the sensor demands are in those markets, so that we can then think about ourselves, our sensor strategy. And when we talk about the acquisition that we made in the quarter, it's a small acquisition, SGX, but there's no question that we saw in our activities in sensors a real trend towards this requirement for air quality sensing application, both in automotive and in industrial applications. And so when we found the right company, we were very eager to bring them into the Amphenol family to round out and to strengthen our technology position in sensors. So I think in a nutshell, we feel really good about it. I think it's performing better than the average across the company and continues to have great potential for us long term."

Or do you think perhaps we just haven't seen the whole picture in that end market yet? And as we get more data points, perhaps it won't look as problematic?"

I think Steve Fox said earlier, ""Do I love all of my children equally?"" And I do, indeed. The industrial market for Amphenol, as I mentioned earlier with Steve's question, it's a really broad market. We have a lot of position in a lot of different subsegments. I don't know that we are always the best canary in the coal mine for whether that is a positive or a negative trend in the overall industrial market. What I know is that our team is pretty good at ferreting out these opportunities as they may come. You don't think of an industrial team as being agile. It's almost by definition the opposite. You think of industrial as being the sort of staid, stable kind of an organization, slow life cycles, long design cycles, all of that. But I'll tell you, our industrial team is a pretty dynamic group of people, and so when they see things like oil and gas being down for now and it's running in the end of its second year  of really tough performance, they don't just sit back and take their medicine. They go out, and they look for new opportunities to find growth wherever they may be. And I think the overall industrial market, if you think about just the biggest trend that is existing in broad industrial, it is this electronification of systems that previously would have been hydraulic and/or mechanic or nonexistent in their functionality. And I think that we see that really across all of the segments that we're in, and then it's a question of just making sure that you have the right solutions, whether that be a discrete connector, a discrete sensor, an antenna, an integrated interconnect solution, an integrated sensor and connector solution, whatever it may be, you have to really make sure that you're tailoring your approach to that customer and you're really knowing the customer and knowing the market. It's a very marketing-intensive business actually, the industrial space, because there's just so many potential customers across these dozens and dozens of subsegments, and staying on top of that and pivoting towards where the right segments are, that's really important. I know there are big industrial kind of giants in the industry, and they may have certain trends at one time or another, but I don't believe that we're necessarily a proxy for those trends."
