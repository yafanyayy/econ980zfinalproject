On today's call, I will focus on the full year and fourth quarter 2015 results of Legacy ACE Limited. I will not comment on Legacy Chubb's '15 results. In the context of currency hea",1684,"Good morning, and welcome to our first earnings call as the new Chubb. On today's call, I will focus on the full year and fourth quarter 2015 results of Legacy ACE Limited. I will not comment on Legacy Chubb's '15 results. 
In the context of currency headwinds, which all multinationals have experienced, ACE had a good quarter that contributed to a very good year by all financial measures, except book value growth, which was impacted in particular by foreign exchange, rising interest rates in the U.S. 
All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to both quarterly and annual operating earnings, which were driven by excellent P&C underwriting and investment income results. 
To the year, we produced over $3.2 billion in operating income, record underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth on a constant-dollar basis and a very good ROE. It was quite a year. In fact, historic from a strategic perspective as we made a number of investments in our company that contributed, and will contribute, to future earnings growth, with the highlight being, of course, our transformational acquisition of Chubb.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $780 million or $2.38 per share. For the year, net operating income was $9.76 per share, essentially flat with last year's record earnings of $9.79 per share. When adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, our full year operating EPS was actually up 3.5%, an achievement few U.S. dollar-based multinationals can claim and a standout result for our industry. In fact, our $3.2 billion of operating income was down 3%, all FX related. Adjusting for that, operating income was flat, something few insurers can boast. 
Our P&C combined ratios were truly excellent. 87 7 for the quarter; and for a full year, a record low of 87.4. For the year, P&C underwriting income was almost $2 billion, again a record for our company. 
In constant dollars, P&C underwriting income was up 8%. This terrific calendar year underwriting results benefited from very strong current accident year performance. P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88 8 for the year. P&C current accident year results are a reflection of our premium revenue growth and margin improvement globally as a result of pricing action, portfolio management efforts, product mix and expense control. 
To breakdown our current accident year underwriting results a bit, the combined ratio for global P&C, which excludes agriculture, was 88.9 for the year. Agriculture had an excellent year and it ran at 88.2. 
Full year net investment income of $2.2 billion was down about 2.5%. It stood up quite well, given the historic low interest rates and it benefited from a very strong cash flow just shy of $4 billion. 
ACE's strong earnings led to very good operating ROEs of over 11% for the quarter and 11.5% for the year. As I have noted before for ACE, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield is equal to approximately 200 basis points of ROE. 
Even with the Fed's first rate increase in 7 years, the short-term interest rate environment remains highly uncertain, given global economic and geopolitical conditions. Although rates will not, and frankly, shouldn't, remain this low indefinitely. 
As I said earlier, ACE, and now Chubb, is a truly global dollar-based multinational insurer with a great spread of business. And as such, foreign exchange impacted our premium revenue, our income and our book value throughout the year. 
In spite of our great earnings performance, per share book value growth was essentially flat for the year. It was up 3.2%, excluding foreign exchange. So we'll have more to say about book value as well as prior period reserved development and catastrophes. 
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. Global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, were down 2%, but up 5% when measured in constant dollars. Whereas for the year, Global P&C grew over 1% on a published basis and nearly 8% in constant dollars. FX had a modestly bigger impact in the quarter than on the full year. 
For the year, our 8% constant dollar growth came primarily from North America, Latin America and Asia. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew over 10%. Net premiums in Latin America and Asia grew 18% and 15%, respectively, whereas they grew 3% on the continent and declined 2% in the U.K. 
Relative to the full year, constant dollar growth in the quarter was lower, again, 5% versus full year 8% and was impacted by both economic conditions in Asia and Latin America, which caused a modest slowdown in our consumer businesses and industry market conditions for our commercial P&C business, which grew more competitive as the year progressed. We will always trade market share for underwriting discipline. 
That leads me to a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. The pricing environment grew incrementally more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally and varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property is more competitive than casualty-related.
For our U.S. commercial P&C business, that's Legacy ACE, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5% in the quarter. Management and professional liability pricing was up 0.5% and property-related pricing was down over 9%. New business writings in North America were down 11% year-on-year as we became more selective, but varied by class, depending on the rates and terms we could secure. So in fact, new business was up in certain targeted classes. 
Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For a U.S. Retail business, the renewal retention rate is measured by premium, was 94% and by policy count, 80%. 
Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 2%, property was down 7% and financial rates were down 3%. 
London wholesale was the most competitive market. For example, aviation was down 8%, energy was down 18% and marine was down 5%.
John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul can provide further color on growth and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
As all of you saw, on January 14, we completed the acquisition of Chubb Corporation for $29.5 billion. The new Chubb is pretty darn impressive by almost any measure. We are, in fact, the largest publicly-traded property/casualty insurer in the world, a global leader in commercial P&C for customers in many sizes, the premier provider of personnel lines to high network individuals and families in the U.S,  the global leader in professional lines and a global leader in NAH and international personal lines. What our organization accomplished in the 6-month period between our acquisition announcement on July 1 and our closing date is simply amazing. And all of it done in parallel. 
Let me give you just a little color. First, led by the entire general management team globally with support of our operations support management group, we established a comprehensive integration road map and detailed integration plan of action that covers all areas globally, including underwriting, claims, sales, marketing, client affect all services, business processing, IT systems, HR and real estate. This ensured that everyone that would be ready to hit the ground running and begin executing as soon as we close the acquisition. We, in fact, are doing that right now. 
Our legal and shareholder communications team secured all the regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the transaction by January 1. Well, we achieved that objective on January 14. Our communications group conceived and launched an entirely new brand. Our finance and investment management group secured $5.3 billion in debt financing, the largest amount ever raised by an insurance company. We concluded all planning necessary so that within the first quarter, we can integrate the entire Chubb investment portfolio into the way we manage investments and reallocate invested assets to secure improved risk-adjusted returns. More to come about this in the future. 
In risk management, we engaged in thoughtful analysis and planning that continues so we can understand the new company's aggregate accumulations and risk profile for all major underwriting classes. Layout a road map for risk appetite and manage the combined company's aggregations and contacts of our balance sheet wherewithal. All underwriters around the world received instructions on day 1 regarding authorities and operating procedures, so we maintained continuity as we hit the ground running. 
Lastly, and most important, all along the way and by year-end where regulatory conditions permitted, we were able to tell the vast majority of virtually all of our customer-facing employees around the world in general management, underwriting, claims, sales and marketing, in all branch offices at all levels that they have a job, what that job is and who they report to. So like I said, while it's very early days, we've hit the ground running, and we are striving to execute with a high degree of discipline. We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process and people and that includes both the expense synergies and new revenue initiatives globally. 
Concerning the latter, our incremental growth plans include new product capabilities to the new market and agency channels. Many employees have been engaged in the formulation of a plan of action to begin launching new growth initiatives during '16. In fact, we had over 1,200 ACE and Chubb colleagues in North America together the first week in January reviewing plans for the year that covered all areas, including new growth initiatives. I couldn't have been more optimistic with what I observed. The feeling was collegial and energized with a strong sense of focus. 
In summary, I'm excited about the value creation potential of the new Chubb and more confident than ever in our future. The energy level and the morale are high and, as always, we are impatient in execution. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take questions."

Investment income for the year was strong at almost $2.2 billion, down 2.6% from last year as reported and 0.7% on a constant-dollar basis. Our full year operating cash flow of $3.9 billion almost completely offset the impact of the rollover from our higher book yield due to lower new money rates.
Investment income for the quarter was $532 million, down $45 million or 7.7% from last year, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements of $14 million, a decline in private equity distributions of $10 million and a decrease in coal previous from our corporate bond portfolio of $15 million. 
Tangible book value declined 0.5% for the year and was adversely impacted by after-tax unrealized investment portfolio losses of $1 billion, unfavorable foreign currency movements of $663 million and the addition of $474 million of intangibles relating to the farmers fund acquisitions. Excluding these items, tangible book value increased 8.5%. 
Net realized and unrealized losses after tax totaled $605 million for the quarter and comprised unrealized losses of $411 million relating to the investment portfolio, primarily due to rising interest rates and realized losses of $109 million from the portfolio, primarily from sale -- sales of portfolio assets to fund the acquisition of Chubb. 
We also had foreign-exchange losses of $138 million and a $55 million realized gain related to the market on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. 
You can see on our balance sheet the short-term investments and cash increased $9.4 billion from September 30. This includes the proceeds of our debt issuance and funds from the liquidation of investment portfolios in preparation for the closing of Chubb.
Our year-end investment portfolio exposure to the energy sector totaled $1.87 billion, down from $3.2 billion in late 2014. When combined with a legacy Chubb portfolio, energy holdings totaled $2.4 billion or 2.3% of the combined portfolio have an average rating of BBB and a well diversified with over 200 issuers. We are comfortable with both the concentration and current valuation of our exposure to the energy sector, which is currently valued at approximately 92% at par. 
Our net loss reserves were up $275 million or 1% for the year adjusted for foreign-exchange. The pay to incurred ratio for the quarter was 111% or 102% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior-period development and cross cap loss payments activity, which by the nature of the business, is heavy in the fourth quarter. 
For the year, our pay-to-incur ratio is 92% and is more indicative of our trends. 
In the quarter, we had positive net prior-period development of $100 million pretax. In our active companies, we had $159 million of positive prior-period development at which $45 million was from long-tail lines, principally from 2009 and prior accident years. The remainder was from short-tail lines. 
In our brandy, wine and other run-off operations, we strengthened reserves by $59 million pretax. The charge related to asbestos and comprised account specific development and defense-related cost on existing accounts. We see no underlying change in the asbestos landscape and the average embedded in severity for individual asbestos claims has remained stable.
Cat losses of $67 million after-tax were almost flat with last year's fourth quarter, with $24 million from the U.S,  $15 million from Europe, $17 million from Latin America and $11 million from Asia. 
Fourth quarter life segment operating income was down versus prior year due to unfavorable claim reserve development in the combined U.S. operation of $11 million after-tax in 2015 compared to positive development of $5 million in 2014. After the 2015 adjustment, the combined ratio for this business remains in the low 90s. 
Life operating income was also affected by the continued run-off  of our variable annuity book, which was down $8 million from the prior year.
Our operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of $34 million in comparison to last year's fourth quarter and $119 million year-on-year. 
With respect to the new Chubb, we estimate an investment income run rate for a full quarter of approximately $810 million to $825 million. the first quarter maybe modestly lower due to the timing of the close. 
We also expect the tax rate ranging from 16% to 18% for 2016. 
Beginning with the first quarter, we are planning additional financial reporting disclosure for the consolidated Chubb. We will provide additional detail around production and underwriting results from both personal lines and commercial lines in North America insurance. And in overseas general insurance, we will provide an additive breakdown by region. We will also provide a more detail on written and earned premium by line of business globally.
We will issue information shortly that provides the format you can expect for our new disclosures. We will provide you with periodic updates on our estimated expense synergies and the estimated cost and timing to achieve both. As you will recall, our stated expense synergy target is $650 million annual run rate by the end of the third year. The current estimate of integration cost is $535 million, with an additional $100 million in branding-related expenses. When we present our operating income in the future, we will exclude the positive impact of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on a Chubb debt we acquired in the transaction and the negative effect of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on the investment portfolio we acquired. We will also exclude, as we have to date, one-time integration costs associated with the transaction. We do believe these items reflect our ongoing operations.
All other purchase accounting intangible amortization will be included in operating income. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

I would like to see the percentage of A&H grow as a percentage of the company's business. That means that great A&H business is growing faster than everything else and that would be terrific. And that would add mission in life just to get that done.  But I want to address yours about stability because I think there is -- I think while that is true on one hand, let's not miss what Legacy Chubb is bringing to Legacy ACE and that is very stable U.S. businesses. The middle market, agency commercial business and the small commercial business that they write has a signature to it. When you look at revenue and profit and loss of that business, that has represents great stability and is a real balanced. I think while you don't compare and contrast one to the other precisely, they're different businesses. Let's not forget that and the quality that, that brings. On the personal lines business, the high net worth personal lines business, I would make the same statement. And finally, what I'd say to you is we become the largest professional lines writer in the world. D&O, E&O, lots of classes of each, but particularly, that Chubb portfolio of professional lines. Unlike ACE that was at the upper middle market and large account end that has a little bit of a more -- a greater volatilities signature to it, pattern to it a bit. The Chubb portfolio is in more middle market and small account related. Tremendous business, a franchise virtually impossible to duplicate in any short period of time by anyone. So when you think about that A&H, I wish you would think about the totality of the business spread of what the new organization becomes. I hope that helps you."

That will manifest itself around the world in different ways. In the short term, one of the things that we know that is always true that companies due to compete and maintain a competitive profile is they just -- they become a little less disciplined in underwriting and it'll show up in pricing in terms and conditions. And if you want to simply defend what you got at all cost or you have less command and control because you're just not operating as well as you might, well, that, in the short term, can actually be to our detriment.

We each review our -- all of our portfolios on a regular basis. We each have outside actuaries review our portfolios as well as our independent auditors. And so it's really a process difference to a degree in some inside baseball that we're dealing with. We will amalgamate it to the ACE processes that will happen through '16. It's already been substantially mapped out for our -- led by our Chief Actuary with the team of both organizations. We have mapped out a new actuarial organization that brings Legacy Chubb, Legacy ACE actuaries on to the same teams and we mix it. So all of that moves forward. And frankly, I think you should feel it as sort of a business as usual."

On the larger business, the only place that I imagine is when you get to where it's real capabilities related, and that is primary layers where you rely on services and it is -- they were very few who are capable of doing that on a global or national basis versus sophisticated companies. There, the market is more disciplined and remains more disciplined because it's a few players who can handle that.

And this year, its business will continue -- will produce -- should produce an increasing profit as the year goes along. But what has been impacting international life no different than our international P&C business is foreign-exchange. And we just don't control the foreign exchange market. So I can't predict that part, but I don't believe you're going to see, going forward, the same kind of impact year-on-year for foreign-exchange that we saw in '15 because I don't think the dollar's going to continue strengthening to the degree that it did. I don't anyone does. And so that will benefit. Combined is growing in North America. We did have some noise around this year around reserves for the prior because the development showed that it -- we may be underpaid its loss ratio in a couple of prior years, but the margin is healthy on that business. And you're comparing a year-on-year when, in fact, we had releases from prior years. And -- but I think that business is growing as we showed you. And I think its margin over a period of time is pretty stable and so it will naturally have a growth in earnings. I can't tell you what quarter that happens. So I imagine that in total, the earnings, as we look forward in the life business, will from quarter to quarter as the year goes along, improve. Not dramatically, but improve.

In the context of currency hea",1685,"Good morning, and welcome to our first earnings call as the new Chubb. On today's call, I will focus on the full year and fourth quarter 2015 results of Legacy ACE Limited. I will not comment on legacy Chubb's '15 results. 
In the context of currency headwinds, which all multinationals have experienced, ACE had a good quarter that contributed to a very good year by all financial measures except book value growth, which was impacted in particular by foreign exchange and rising interest rates in the U.S. 
All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to both quarterly and annual operating earnings, which were driven by excellent P&C underwriting and investment income results. 
To the year, we've produced over $3.2 billion in operating income, record underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth on a constant-dollar basis and a very good ROE. It was quite a year. In fact, historic from a strategic perspective as we made a number of investments in our company that contributed, and will contribute, to future earnings growth, with the highlight being, of course, our transformational acquisition of Chubb.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $780 million or $2.38 per share. For the year, net operating income was $9.76 per share, essentially flat with last year's record earnings of $9.79 per share. When adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, our full year operating EPS was actually up 3.5%, an achievement few U.S. dollar-based multinationals can claim and a standout result for our industry. In fact, our $3.2 billion of operating income was down 3%, all FX related. Adjusting for that, operating income was flat, something few insurers can boast. 
Our P&C combined ratios were truly excellent. 87.7% for the quarter; and for the full year, a record low of 87.4%. For the year, P&C underwriting income was almost $2 billion, again a record for our company. In constant dollars, P&C underwriting income was up 8%. 
These terrific calendar year underwriting results benefited from very strong current accident year performance. P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% for the year. The P&C current accident year results are a reflection of our premium revenue growth and margin improvement globally as a result of pricing action, portfolio management efforts, product mix and expense control. 
To break down our current accident year underwriting results a bit. The combined ratio for global P&C, which excludes agriculture, was 88.9% for the year. Agriculture had an excellent year and it ran at 88.2%. 
Full year net investment income of $2.2 billion was down about 2.5%. It stood up quite well given the historic low interest rates and it benefited from a very strong cash flow, just shy of $4 billion. 
ACE's strong earnings led to very good operating ROEs of over 11% for the quarter and 11.5% for the year. As I have noted before for ACE, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield is equal to approximately 200 basis points of ROE. 
Even with the Fed's first rate increase in 7 years, the short-term interest rate environment remained highly uncertain, given global economic and geopolitical conditions. Although rates will not, and frankly shouldn't, remain this low indefinitely. 
As I said earlier, ACE, and now Chubb, is a truly global dollar-based multinational insurer with a great spread of business. And as such, foreign exchange impacted our premium revenue, our income and our book value throughout the year. 
In spite of our great earnings performance, per share book value growth was essentially flat for the year. It was up 3.2% excluding foreign exchange. Phil will have more to say about book value as well as prior period reserve development and catastrophes. 
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. Global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, were down 2%, but up 5% when measured in constant dollars. Whereas for the year, Global P&C grew over 1% on a published basis and nearly 8% in constant dollars. FX had a modestly bigger impact in the quarter than on the full year. 
For the year, our 8% constant-dollar growth came primarily from North America, Latin America and Asia. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew over 10%. Net premiums in Latin America and Asia grew 18% and 15%, respectively, whereas they grew 3% on the continent and declined 2% in the U.K. 
Relative to the full year, constant-dollar growth in the quarter was slower, again, 5% versus full year 8%, and was impacted by both economic conditions in Asia and Latin America, which caused a modest slowdown in our consumer businesses; and industry market conditions for our commercial P&C business, which grew more competitive as the year progressed. We will always trade market share for underwriting discipline. 
That leads me to a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. The pricing environment grew incrementally more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally and varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property is more competitive than casualty-related.
For our U.S. commercial P&C business, that's Legacy ACE, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5% in the quarter. Management and professional liability pricing was up 0.5% and property-related pricing was down over 9%. New business writings in North America were down 11% year-on-year as we became more selective, but varied by class, depending on the rates and terms we could secure. So in fact, new business was up in certain targeted classes. 
Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For our U.S. Retail business, the renewal retention rate is measured by premium, was 94%; and by policy count, 80%. 
Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 2%, property was down 7% and financial lines rates were down 3%. London wholesale was the most competitive market. For example, aviation was down 8%, energy was down 18% and marine was down 5%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump can provide further color on growth and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
As all of you saw on January 14, we completed the acquisition of Chubb Corporation for $29.5 billion. The new Chubb is pretty darn impressive by almost any measure. We are, in fact, the largest publicly-traded property/casualty insurer in the world, a global leader in commercial P&C for customers of many sizes, the premier provider of personnel lines to high net worth individuals and families in the U.S., the global leader in professional lines and a global leader in A&H and international personal lines. 
What our organization accomplished in the 6-month period between our acquisition announcement on July 1 and our closing date is simply amazing. And all of it done in parallel. Let me give you just a little color. First, led by the entire general management team globally with support of our operations management group, we established a comprehensive integration road map and detailed integration plan of action that covers all areas globally, including underwriting, claims, sales, marketing, client and technical services, business processing, IT systems, HR and real estate. This ensured that everyone would be ready to hit the ground running and begin executing as soon as we close the acquisition. We, in fact, are doing that right now. 
Our legal and shareholder communications team secured all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the transaction by January 1. Well, we achieved that objective on January 14. Our communications group conceived and launched an entirely new brand. Our finance and investment management group secured $5.3 billion in debt financing, the largest amount ever raised by an insurance company. We concluded all planning necessary so that within the first quarter, we can integrate the entire Chubb investment portfolio into the way we manage investments and reallocate the invested asset to secure improved risk-adjusted returns. More to come about this in the future. 
In risk management, we engaged in thoughtful analysis and planning that continues so we can understand the new company's aggregate accumulations and risk profile for all major underwriting classes, lay out a road map for risk appetite and manage the combined company's aggregations in context of our balance sheet wherewithal. All underwriters around the world received instructions on day 1 regarding authorities and operating procedures, so we maintained continuity as we hit the ground running. 
Lastly and most important, all along the way and by year-end where regulatory conditions permitted, we were able to tell the vast majority of virtually all of our customer-facing employees around the world in general management, underwriting, claims, sales and marketing, in all branch offices at all levels that they have a job, what that job is and who they report to. 
So like I said, while it's very early days, we've hit the ground running, and we are striving to execute with a high degree of discipline. We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process and people, and that includes both expense synergies and new revenue initiatives globally. 
Concerning the latter, our incremental growth plans include new product capabilities to the middle market and agency channels. Many employees have been engaged in the formulation of a plan of action to begin launching new growth initiatives during '16. In fact, we had over 1,200 ACE and Chubb colleagues in North America together the first week in January reviewing plans for the year that covered all areas, including new growth initiatives. I couldn't have been more optimistic with what I observed. The feeling was collegial and energized with a strong sense of focus. 
In summary, I'm excited about the value creation potential of the new Chubb and more confident than ever in our future. The energy level and the morale are high. And as always, we are impatient in execution. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions."
203028,302389966,921546,"ACE Limited, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan.

Investment income for the year was strong at almost $2.2 billion, down 2.6% from last year as reported and 0.7% on a constant-dollar basis. Our full year operating cash flow of $3.9 billion almost completely offset the impact of the rollover from our higher book yield to lower new money rates.
Investment income for the quarter was $532 million, down $45 million or 7.7% from last year, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements of $14 million, a decline in private equity distributions of $10 million and a decrease in call premiums from our corporate bond portfolio of $15 million. 
Tangible book value declined 0.5% for the year and was adversely impacted by after-tax unrealized investment portfolio losses of $1 billion, unfavorable foreign currency movements of $663 million and the addition of $474 million of intangibles relating to the Fireman's Fund acquisition. Excluding these items, tangible book value increased 8.5%. 
Net realized and unrealized losses after tax totaled $605 million for the quarter and comprised unrealized losses of $411 million relating to the investment portfolio, primarily due to rising interest rates; and realized losses of $109 million from the portfolio, primarily from sales of portfolio assets to fund the acquisition of Chubb. 
We also had foreign exchange losses of $138 million and a $55 million realized gain related to the mark on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. 
You can see on our balance sheet that short-term investments and cash increased $9.4 billion from September 30. This includes the proceeds of our debt issuance and funds from the liquidation of investment portfolios in preparation for the closing of Chubb.
Our year-end investment portfolio exposure to the energy sector totaled $1.87 billion, down from $3.2 billion in late 2014. When combined with the legacy Chubb portfolio, energy holdings totaled $2.4 billion or 2.3% of the combined portfolio, have an average rating of BBB and are well diversified, with over 200 issuers. We are comfortable with both the concentration and current valuation of our exposure to the energy sector, which is currently valued at approximately 92% of par. 
Our net loss reserves were up $275 million or 1% for the year, adjusted for foreign-exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 111% or 102% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior-period development and cross -- crop loss payments activity, which by the nature of the business, is heavy in the fourth quarter. For the year, our paid-to-incurred ratio is 92% and is more indicative of our trends. 
In the quarter, we had positive net prior-period development of $100 million pretax. In our active companies, we had $159 million of positive prior-period development, of which $45 million was from long-tail lines principally from 2009 and prior accident years. The remainder was from short-tail lines. 
In our Brandywine and other run-off operations, we strengthened reserves by $59 million pretax. The charge related to asbestos and comprised account-specific development and defense-related cost on existing accounts. We see no underlying change in the asbestos landscape, and the average indemnity severity for individual asbestos claims has remained stable.
Cat losses of $67 million after-tax were almost flat with last year's fourth quarter, with $24 million from the U.S., $15 million from Europe, $17 million from Latin America and $11 million from Asia. 
Fourth quarter life segment operating income was down versus prior year due to unfavorable claim reserve development in the combined U.S. operation of $11 million after tax in 2015 compared to positive development of $5 million in 2014. After the 2015 adjustment, the combined ratio for this business remains in the low 90s. Life operating income was also affected by the continued run-off  of our variable annuity book, which was down $8 million from the prior year.
Our operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of $34 million in comparison to last year's fourth quarter and $119 million year-on-year. 
With respect to the new Chubb, we estimate an investment income run rate for a full quarter of approximately $810 million to $825 million. The first quarter may be modestly lower due to the timing of the close. We also expect a tax rate ranging from 16% to 18% for 2016. 
Beginning with the first quarter, we are planning additional financial reporting disclosure for the consolidated Chubb. We will provide additional detail around production and underwriting results from both personal lines and commercial lines in North America insurance. And in overseas general insurance, we will provide an aggregate breakdown by region. We will also provide more detail on written and earned premium by line of business globally. We will issue information shortly that provides the format you can expect for our new disclosures. 
We will provide you with periodic updates on our estimated expense synergies and the estimated cost and timing to achieve both. As you will recall, our stated expense synergy target is $650 million annual run rate by the end of the third year. The current estimate of integration cost is $535 million, with an additional $100 million in branding-related expenses. 
When we present our operating income in the future, we will exclude the positive impact of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on a Chubb debt we acquired in the transaction and the negative effect of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on the investment portfolio we acquired. We will also exclude, as we have to date, onetime integration costs associated with the transaction. We don't believe these items reflect our ongoing operations. All other purchase accounting intangible amortization will be included in operating income. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

And I'm afraid, given the political gridlock in that country, that will not happen in a short period of time. You talk to smart Brazilians who are worldly, who are well-educated, they understand what needs to be done in their country. And I suppose just like in our country, it's left to the local citizens to ultimately address it, and they will. In the meantime, look, our business is a good business and it is fundamentally a very good business. We continue to make money in Brazil. Of course, we suffer from the foreign exchange and there's nothing you're going to do about that. On a local currency basis, it's business as usual for them.

And we want to grow, and that business has growth potential in important areas of the world over a period of time, over any reasonable period of time, and we intend to pursue that rigorously. I would like to see the percentage of A&H grow as a percentage of the company's business. That means that great A&H business is growing faster than everything else and that would be terrific. And that would -- that is Ed Clancy's mission in life, just to get that done. But I want to address yours about stability because I think there is -- I think while that is true on one hand, let's not miss what Legacy Chubb is bringing to Legacy ACE, and that is very stable U.S. businesses. The middle market, agency commercial business and the small commercial business that they write has a signature to it. When you look at revenue and profit and loss of that business, that has -- represents great stability and is a real ballast. I think while you don't compare and contrast one to the other precisely, they're different businesses. Let's not forget that and the quality that, that brings. On the personal lines business, the high net worth personal lines business, I would make the same statement. And finally, what I'd say to you is we become the largest professional lines writer in the world. D&O, E&O, lots of classes of each, but particularly, that Chubb portfolio of professional lines. Unlike ACE that was at the upper middle market and large account end, that has a little bit of a more -- a greater volatility signature to it, pattern to it. But the Chubb portfolio is in more middle market and small account related. Tremendous business, a franchise virtually impossible to duplicate in any short period of time by anyone. So when you think about that A&H, I wish you would think about the totality of the business spread of what the new organization becomes. I hope that helps you."

It inspires confidence and financial services in who you do business with. First and foremost, the grease of that is confidence. And so I think that you can't get away from that. That will manifest itself around the world in different ways. In the short term, one of the things that we know that is always true that companies do to compete and maintain a competitive profile is they just -- they become a little less disciplined in underwriting, and it'll show up in pricing and terms and conditions. And if you want to simply defend what you got at all cost or you have less command and control because you're just not operating as well as you might, well, that, in the short term, can actually be to our detriment. Like a wounded animal out there, sometimes, stay out of the way. And that, I would suggest to you, is a little bit of a dynamic in the short term that we see, and we're disciplined guys.

And I think you have years of track record of each to observe that.  The difference between us is not in reserve philosophy, or in rigor or in knowledge of our businesses. The difference is a bidding process of how we each go about it, and it's on the margin. It's not in the main event substance of it. We each have pricing actuaries separate from reserving actuaries. We each review our -- all of our portfolios on a regular basis. We each have outside actuaries review our portfolios as well as our independent auditors. And so it's really a process difference to a degree and some inside baseball that we're dealing with. We will amalgamate it to the ACE processes that will happen through '16. It's already been substantially mapped out by our -- led by our Chief Actuary with the team of both organizations.

It energizes producers and the imagination. It reestablishes further your image and your relationship with clients, and it's -- and over time, it just burnishes your franchise and makes it that much stronger as it builds revenue.

On the larger business, the only place that I imagine is when you get to where its real capability is related, and that is primary layers where you rely on services and it is -- there were very few who are capable of doing that on a global or national basis for sophisticated companies. There, the market is more disciplined and remains more disciplined because it's a few players who can handle that.

And this year, its business will continue -- will produce -- should produce an increasing profit as the year goes along. But what has been impacting international life, no different than our international P&C business, is foreign exchange. And we just don't control the foreign exchange market. So I can't predict that part, but I don't believe you're going to see, going forward, the same kind of impact year-on-year for foreign exchange that we saw in '15 because I don't think the dollar is going to continue strengthening to the degree that it did. I don't think anyone does. So that will benefit. Combined is growing in North America. We did have some noise around -- this year around reserves for the prior because the development showed that it -- we may be underpaid this loss ratio in a couple of prior years, but the margin is healthy on that business. And you're comparing a year-on-year when in fact we had releases from prior years. And -- but I think that business is growing as we've showed you. And I think its margin over a period of time is pretty stable and so it will naturally have a growth in earnings. I can't tell you what quarter that happens.

In the context of currency hea",1685,"Good morning, and welcome to our first earnings call as the new Chubb. On today's call, I will focus on the full year and fourth quarter 2015 results of Legacy ACE Limited. I will not comment on legacy Chubb's '15 results. 
In the context of currency headwinds, which all multinationals have experienced, ACE had a good quarter that contributed to a very good year by all financial measures except book value growth, which was impacted in particular by foreign exchange and rising interest rates in the U.S. 
All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to both quarterly and annual operating earnings, which were driven by excellent P&C underwriting and investment income results. 
For the year, we've produced over $3.2 billion in operating income, record underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth on a constant-dollar basis and a very good ROE. It was quite a year. In fact, historic from a strategic perspective as we made a number of investments in our company that contributed, and will contribute, to future earnings growth, with the highlight being, of course, our transformational acquisition of Chubb.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $780 million or $2.38 per share. For the year, net operating income was $9.76 per share, essentially flat with last year's record earnings of $9.79 per share. When adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, our full year operating EPS was actually up 3.5%, an achievement few U.S. dollar-based multinationals can claim and a standout result for our industry. In fact, our $3.2 billion of operating income was down 3%, all FX related. Adjusting for that, operating income was flat, something few insurers can boast. 
Our P&C combined ratios were truly excellent. 87.7% for the quarter; and for the full year, a record low of 87.4%. For the year, P&C underwriting income was almost $2 billion, again a record for our company. In constant dollars, P&C underwriting income was up 8%. 
These terrific calendar year underwriting results benefited from very strong current accident year performance. P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% for the year. The P&C current accident year results are a reflection of our premium revenue growth and margin improvement globally as a result of pricing action, portfolio management efforts, product mix and expense control. 
To break down our current accident year underwriting results a bit. The combined ratio for global P&C, which excludes agriculture, was 88.9% for the year. Agriculture had an excellent year and it ran at 88.2%. 
Full year net investment income of $2.2 billion was down about 2.5%. It stood up quite well given the historic low interest rates and it benefited from a very strong cash flow, just shy of $4 billion. 
ACE's strong earnings led to very good operating ROEs of over 11% for the quarter and 11.5% for the year. As I have noted before for ACE, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield is equal to approximately 200 basis points of ROE. 
Even with the Fed's first rate increase in 7 years, the short-term interest rate environment remained highly uncertain, given global economic and geopolitical conditions. Although rates will not, and frankly shouldn't, remain this low indefinitely. 
As I said earlier, ACE, and now Chubb, is a truly global dollar-based multinational insurer with a great spread of business. And as such, foreign exchange impacted our premium revenue, our income and our book value throughout the year. 
In spite of our great earnings performance, per share book value growth was essentially flat for the year. It was up 3.2% excluding foreign exchange. Phil will have more to say about book value as well as prior period reserve development and catastrophes. 
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. Global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, were down 2%, but up 5% when measured in constant dollars. Whereas for the year, Global P&C grew over 1% on a published basis and nearly 8% in constant dollars. FX had a modestly bigger impact in the quarter than on the full year. 
For the year, our 8% constant-dollar growth came primarily from North America, Latin America and Asia. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew over 10%. Net premiums in Latin America and Asia grew 18% and 15%, respectively, whereas they grew 3% on the continent and declined 2% in the U.K. 
Relative to the full year, constant-dollar growth in the quarter was slower, again, 5% versus full year 8%, and was impacted by both economic conditions in Asia and Latin America, which caused a modest slowdown in our consumer businesses; and industry market conditions for our commercial P&C business, which grew more competitive as the year progressed. We will always trade market share for underwriting discipline. 
That leads me to a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. The pricing environment grew incrementally more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally and varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property is more competitive than casualty-related.
For our U.S. commercial P&C business, that's Legacy ACE, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5% in the quarter. Management and professional liability pricing was up 0.5% and property-related pricing was down over 9%. New business writings in North America were down 11% year-on-year as we became more selective, but varied by class, depending on the rates and terms we could secure. So in fact, new business was up in certain targeted classes. 
Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For our U.S. Retail business, the renewal retention rate is measured by premium, was 94%; and by policy count, 80%. 
Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 2%, property was down 7% and financial lines rates were down 3%. London wholesale was the most competitive market. For example, aviation was down 8%, energy was down 18% and marine was down 5%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump can provide further color on growth and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
As all of you saw on January 14, we completed the acquisition of Chubb Corporation for $29.5 billion. The new Chubb is pretty darn impressive by almost any measure. We are, in fact, the largest publicly-traded property/casualty insurer in the world, a global leader in commercial P&C for customers of many sizes, the premier provider of personal lines to high net worth individuals and families in the U.S., the global leader in professional lines and a global leader in A&H and international personal lines. 
What our organization accomplished in the 6-month period between our acquisition announcement on July 1 and our closing date is simply amazing. And all of it done in parallel. Let me give you just a little color. First, led by the entire general management team globally with support of our operations management group, we established a comprehensive integration road map and detailed integration plan of action that covers all areas globally, including underwriting, claims, sales, marketing, client and technical services, business processing, IT systems, HR and real estate. This ensured that everyone would be ready to hit the ground running and begin executing as soon as we close the acquisition. We, in fact, are doing that right now. 
Our legal and shareholder communications team secured all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the transaction by January 1. Well, we achieved that objective on January 14. Our communications group conceived and launched an entirely new brand. Our finance and investment management group secured $5.3 billion in debt financing, the largest amount ever raised by an insurance company. We concluded all planning necessary so that within the first quarter, we can integrate the entire Chubb investment portfolio into the way we manage investments and reallocate the invested asset to secure improved risk-adjusted returns. More to come about this in the future. 
In risk management, we engaged in thoughtful analysis and planning that continues so we can understand the new company's aggregate accumulations and risk profile for all major underwriting classes, lay out a road map for risk appetite and manage the combined company's aggregations in context of our balance sheet wherewithal. All underwriters around the world received instructions on day 1 regarding authorities and operating procedures, so we maintained continuity as we hit the ground running. 
Lastly and most important, all along the way and by year-end where regulatory conditions permitted, we were able to tell the vast majority of virtually all of our customer-facing employees around the world in general management, underwriting, claims, sales and marketing, in all branch offices at all levels that they have a job, what that job is and who they report to. 
So like I said, while it's very early days, we've hit the ground running, and we are striving to execute with a high degree of discipline. We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process and people, and that includes both expense synergies and new revenue initiatives globally. 
Concerning the latter, our incremental growth plans include new product capabilities to the middle market and agency channels. Many employees have been engaged in the formulation of a plan of action to begin launching new growth initiatives during '16. In fact, we had over 1,200 ACE and Chubb colleagues in North America together the first week in January reviewing plans for the year that covered all areas, including new growth initiatives. I couldn't have been more optimistic with what I observed. The feeling was collegial and energized with a strong sense of focus. 
In summary, I'm excited about the value creation potential of the new Chubb and more confident than ever in our future. The energy level and the morale are high. And as always, we are impatient in execution. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions."

Investment income for the year was strong at almost $2.2 billion, down 2.6% from last year as reported and 0.7% on a constant-dollar basis. Our full year operating cash flow of $3.9 billion almost completely offset the impact of the rollover from our higher book yield to lower new money rates.
Investment income for the quarter was $532 million, down $45 million or 7.7% from last year, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements of $14 million, a decline in private equity distributions of $10 million and a decrease in call premiums from our corporate bond portfolio of $15 million. 
Tangible book value declined 0.5% for the year and was adversely impacted by after-tax unrealized investment portfolio losses of $1 billion, unfavorable foreign currency movements of $663 million and the addition of $474 million of intangibles relating to the Fireman's Fund acquisition. Excluding these items, tangible book value increased 8.5%. 
Net realized and unrealized losses after tax totaled $605 million for the quarter and comprised unrealized losses of $411 million relating to the investment portfolio, primarily due to rising interest rates; and realized losses of $109 million from the portfolio, primarily from sales of portfolio assets to fund the acquisition of Chubb. 
We also had foreign exchange losses of $138 million and a $55 million realized gain related to the mark on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. 
You can see on our balance sheet that short-term investments and cash increased $9.4 billion from September 30. This includes the proceeds of our debt issuance and funds from the liquidation of investment portfolios in preparation for the closing of Chubb.
Our year-end investment portfolio exposure to the energy sector totaled $1.87 billion, down from $3.2 billion in late 2014. When combined with the legacy Chubb portfolio, energy holdings totaled $2.4 billion or 2.3% of the combined portfolio, have an average rating of BBB and are well diversified, with over 200 issuers. We are comfortable with both the concentration and current valuation of our exposure to the energy sector, which is currently valued at approximately 92% of par. 
Our net loss reserves were up $275 million or 1% for the year, adjusted for foreign-exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 111% or 102% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior-period development and cross -- crop loss payments activity, which by the nature of the business, is heavy in the fourth quarter. For the year, our paid-to-incurred ratio is 92% and is more indicative of our trends. 
In the quarter, we had positive net prior-period development of $100 million pretax. In our active companies, we had $159 million of positive prior-period development, of which $45 million was from long-tail lines principally from 2009 and prior accident years. The remainder was from short-tail lines. 
In our Brandywine and other run-off operations, we strengthened reserves by $59 million pretax. The charge related to asbestos and comprised account-specific development and defense-related cost on existing accounts. We see no underlying change in the asbestos landscape, and the average indemnity severity for individual asbestos claims has remained stable.
Cat losses of $67 million after-tax were almost flat with last year's fourth quarter, with $24 million from the U.S., $15 million from Europe, $17 million from Latin America and $11 million from Asia. 
Fourth quarter life segment operating income was down versus prior year due to unfavorable claim reserve development in the combined U.S. operation of $11 million after tax in 2015 compared to positive development of $5 million in 2014. After the 2015 adjustment, the combined ratio for this business remains in the low 90s. Life operating income was also affected by the continued run-off of our variable annuity book, which was down $8 million from the prior year.
Our operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of $34 million in comparison to last year's fourth quarter and $119 million year-on-year. 
With respect to the new Chubb, we estimate an investment income run rate for a full quarter of approximately $810 million to $825 million. The first quarter may be modestly lower due to the timing of the close. We also expect a tax rate ranging from 16% to 18% for 2016. 
Beginning with the first quarter, we are planning additional financial reporting disclosure for the consolidated Chubb. We will provide additional detail around production and underwriting results from both personal lines and commercial lines in North America insurance. And in overseas general insurance, we will provide an aggregate breakdown by region. We will also provide more detail on written and earned premium by line of business globally. We will issue information shortly that provides the format you can expect for our new disclosures. 
We will provide you with periodic updates on our estimated expense synergies and the estimated cost and timing to achieve both. As you will recall, our stated expense synergy target is $650 million annual run rate by the end of the third year. The current estimate of integration cost is $535 million, with an additional $100 million in branding-related expenses. 
When we present our operating income in the future, we will exclude the positive impact of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on a Chubb debt we acquired in the transaction and the negative effect of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on the investment portfolio we acquired. We will also exclude, as we have to date, onetime integration costs associated with the transaction. We don't believe these items reflect our ongoing operations. All other purchase accounting intangible amortization will be included in operating income. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

And we want to grow, and that business has growth potential in important areas of the world over a period of time, over any reasonable period of time, and we intend to pursue that rigorously. I would like to see the percentage of A&H grow as a percentage of the company's business. That means that great A&H business is growing faster than everything else and that would be terrific. And that would -- that is Ed Clancy's mission in life, just to get that done. But I want to address yours about stability because I think there is -- I think while that is true on one hand, let's not miss what legacy Chubb is bringing to Legacy ACE, and that is very stable U.S. businesses. The middle market, agency commercial business and the small commercial business that they write has a signature to it. When you look at revenue and profit and loss of that business, that has -- represents great stability and is a real ballast. I think while you don't compare and contrast one to the other precisely, they're different businesses. Let's not forget that and the quality that, that brings. On the personal lines business, the high net worth personal lines business, I would make the same statement. And finally, what I'd say to you is we become the largest professional lines writer in the world. D&O, E&O, lots of classes of each, but particularly, that Chubb portfolio of professional lines. Unlike ACE that was at the upper middle market and large account end, that has a little bit of a more -- a greater volatility signature to it, pattern to it. But the Chubb portfolio is in more middle market and small account related. Tremendous business, a franchise virtually impossible to duplicate in any short period of time by anyone. So when you think about that A&H, I wish you would think about the totality of the business spread of what the new organization becomes. I hope that helps you."

It inspires confidence and financial services in who you do business with. First and foremost, the grease of that is confidence. And so I think that you can't get away from that. That will manifest itself around the world in different ways. In the short term, one of the things that we know that is always true that companies do to compete and maintain a competitive profile is they just -- they become a little less disciplined in underwriting, and it'll show up in pricing and terms and conditions. And if you want to simply defend what you got at all cost or you have less command and control because you're just not operating as well as you might, well, that, in the short term, can actually be to our detriment.

And I think you have years of track record of each to observe that. The difference between us is not in reserve philosophy, or in rigor or in knowledge of our businesses. The difference is a bid-in process of how we each go about it, and it's on the margin. It's not in the main event substance of it. We each have pricing actuaries separate from reserving actuaries. We each review our -- all of our portfolios on a regular basis. We each have outside actuaries review our portfolios as well as our independent auditors. And so it's really a process difference to a degree and some inside baseball that we're dealing with. We will amalgamate it to the ACE processes that will happen through '16. It's already been substantially mapped out by our -- led by our Chief Actuary with the team of both organizations.

But that takes time. We'll launch it but -- and there'll be launches throughout '16. But building revenue that casts a shadow in that takes time, particularly if you think about middle market or you think about small commercial. You can do a lot of volume of policies, but average premiums are relatively small. So it takes time to build. But you know what, what does it do? It energizes the organization. It energizes producers and the imagination. It reestablishes further your image and your relationship with clients, and it -- and over time, it just burnishes your franchise and makes it that much stronger as it builds revenue.

On the larger business, the only place that I imagine is when you get to where its real capability is related, and that is primary layers where you rely on services and it is -- there are very few who are capable of doing that on a global or national basis for sophisticated companies. There, the market is more disciplined and remains more disciplined because it's a few players who can handle that.

And you're comparing a year-on-year when in fact we had releases from prior years. And -- but I think that business is growing as we've showed you. And I think its margin over a period of time is pretty stable and so it will naturally have a growth in earnings. I can't tell you what quarter that happens. So I imagine that in total, the earnings, as we look forward in the life business, will, from quarter-to-quarter, as the year goes along, improve. Not dramatically, but improve. And I think that trend of VA going down but international life's earnings emerging, that part will accelerate over the next couple of years. Does that help you?"

In the context of currency hea",1685,"Good morning, and welcome to our first earnings call as the new Chubb. On today's call, I will focus on the full year and fourth quarter 2015 results of Legacy ACE Limited. I will not comment on legacy Chubb's '15 results. 
In the context of currency headwinds, which all multinationals have experienced, ACE had a good quarter that contributed to a very good year by all financial measures except book value growth, which was impacted in particular by foreign exchange and rising interest rates in the U.S. 
All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to both quarterly and annual operating earnings, which were driven by excellent P&C underwriting and investment income results. 
For the year, we've produced over $3.2 billion in operating income, record underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth on a constant-dollar basis and a very good ROE. It was quite a year. In fact, historic from a strategic perspective as we made a number of investments in our company that contributed, and will contribute, to future earnings growth, with the highlight being, of course, our transformational acquisition of Chubb.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $780 million or $2.38 per share. For the year, net operating income was $9.76 per share, essentially flat with last year's record earnings of $9.79 per share. When adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, our full year operating EPS was actually up 3.5%, an achievement few U.S. dollar-based multinationals can claim and a standout result for our industry. In fact, our $3.2 billion of operating income was down 3%, all FX related. Adjusting for that, operating income was flat, something few insurers can boast. 
Our P&C combined ratios were truly excellent. 87.7% for the quarter; and for the full year, a record low of 87.4%. For the year, P&C underwriting income was almost $2 billion, again a record for our company. In constant dollars, P&C underwriting income was up 8%. 
These terrific calendar year underwriting results benefited from very strong current accident year performance. P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% for the year. The P&C current accident year results are a reflection of our premium revenue growth and margin improvement globally as a result of pricing action, portfolio management efforts, product mix and expense control. 
To break down our current accident year underwriting results a bit. The combined ratio for global P&C, which excludes agriculture, was 88.9% for the year. Agriculture had an excellent year and it ran at 88.2%. 
Full year net investment income of $2.2 billion was down about 2.5%. It stood up quite well given the historic low interest rates and it benefited from a very strong cash flow, just shy of $4 billion. 
ACE's strong earnings led to very good operating ROEs of over 11% for the quarter and 11.5% for the year. As I have noted before for ACE, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield is equal to approximately 200 basis points of ROE. 
Even with the Fed's first rate increase in 7 years, the short-term interest rate environment remained highly uncertain, given global economic and geopolitical conditions. Although rates will not, and frankly shouldn't, remain this low indefinitely. 
As I said earlier, ACE, and now Chubb, is a truly global dollar-based multinational insurer with a great spread of business. And as such, foreign exchange impacted our premium revenue, our income and our book value throughout the year. 
In spite of our great earnings performance, per share book value growth was essentially flat for the year. It was up 3.2% excluding foreign exchange. Phil will have more to say about book value as well as prior period reserve development and catastrophes. 
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. Global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, were down 2%, but up 5% when measured in constant dollars. Whereas for the year, Global P&C grew over 1% on a published basis and nearly 8% in constant dollars. FX had a modestly bigger impact in the quarter than on the full year. 
For the year, our 8% constant-dollar growth came primarily from North America, Latin America and Asia. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew over 10%. Net premiums in Latin America and Asia grew 18% and 15%, respectively, whereas they grew 3% on the continent and declined 2% in the U.K. 
Relative to the full year, constant-dollar growth in the quarter was slower, again, 5% versus full year 8%, and was impacted by both economic conditions in Asia and Latin America, which caused a modest slowdown in our consumer businesses; and industry market conditions for our commercial P&C business, which grew more competitive as the year progressed. We will always trade market share for underwriting discipline. 
That leads me to a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. The pricing environment grew incrementally more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally and varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property is more competitive than casualty-related.
For our U.S. commercial P&C business, that's Legacy ACE, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5% in the quarter. Management and professional liability pricing was up 0.5% and property-related pricing was down over 9%. New business writings in North America were down 11% year-on-year as we became more selective, but varied by class, depending on the rates and terms we could secure. So in fact, new business was up in certain targeted classes. 
Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For our U.S. Retail business, the renewal retention rate is measured by premium, was 94%; and by policy count, 80%. 
Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 2%, property was down 7% and financial lines rates were down 3%. London wholesale was the most competitive market. For example, aviation was down 8%, energy was down 18% and marine was down 5%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump can provide further color on growth and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
As all of you saw on January 14, we completed the acquisition of Chubb Corporation for $29.5 billion. The new Chubb is pretty darn impressive by almost any measure. We are, in fact, the largest publicly-traded property/casualty insurer in the world, a global leader in commercial P&C for customers of many sizes, the premier provider of personal lines to high net worth individuals and families in the U.S., the global leader in professional lines and a global leader in A&H and international personal lines. 
What our organization accomplished in the 6-month period between our acquisition announcement on July 1 and our closing date is simply amazing. And all of it done in parallel. Let me give you just a little color. First, led by the entire general management team globally with support of our operations management group, we established a comprehensive integration road map and detailed integration plan of action that covers all areas globally, including underwriting, claims, sales, marketing, client and technical services, business processing, IT systems, HR and real estate. This ensured that everyone would be ready to hit the ground running and begin executing as soon as we close the acquisition. We, in fact, are doing that right now. 
Our legal and shareholder communications team secured all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the transaction by January 1. Well, we achieved that objective on January 14. Our communications group conceived and launched an entirely new brand. Our finance and investment management group secured $5.3 billion in debt financing, the largest amount ever raised by an insurance company. We concluded all planning necessary so that within the first quarter, we can integrate the entire Chubb investment portfolio into the way we manage investments and reallocate the invested asset to secure improved risk-adjusted returns. More to come about this in the future. 
In risk management, we engaged in thoughtful analysis and planning that continues so we can understand the new company's aggregate accumulations and risk profile for all major underwriting classes, lay out a road map for risk appetite and manage the combined company's aggregations in context of our balance sheet wherewithal. All underwriters around the world received instructions on day 1 regarding authorities and operating procedures, so we maintained continuity as we hit the ground running. 
Lastly and most important, all along the way and by year-end where regulatory conditions permitted, we were able to tell the vast majority of virtually all of our customer-facing employees around the world in general management, underwriting, claims, sales and marketing, in all branch offices at all levels that they have a job, what that job is and who they report to. 
So like I said, while it's very early days, we've hit the ground running, and we are striving to execute with a high degree of discipline. We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process and people, and that includes both expense synergies and new revenue initiatives globally. 
Concerning the latter, our incremental growth plans include new product capabilities to the middle market and agency channels. Many employees have been engaged in the formulation of a plan of action to begin launching new growth initiatives during '16. In fact, we had over 1,200 ACE and Chubb colleagues in North America together the first week in January reviewing plans for the year that covered all areas, including new growth initiatives. I couldn't have been more optimistic with what I observed. The feeling was collegial and energized with a strong sense of focus. 
In summary, I'm excited about the value creation potential of the new Chubb and more confident than ever in our future. The energy level and the morale are high. And as always, we are impatient in execution. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions."

Investment income for the year was strong at almost $2.2 billion, down 2.6% from last year as reported and 0.7% on a constant-dollar basis. Our full year operating cash flow of $3.9 billion almost completely offset the impact of the rollover from our higher book yield to lower new money rates.
Investment income for the quarter was $532 million, down $45 million or 7.7% from last year, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements of $14 million, a decline in private equity distributions of $10 million and a decrease in call premiums from our corporate bond portfolio of $15 million. 
Tangible book value declined 0.5% for the year and was adversely impacted by after-tax unrealized investment portfolio losses of $1 billion, unfavorable foreign currency movements of $663 million and the addition of $474 million of intangibles relating to the Fireman's Fund acquisition. Excluding these items, tangible book value increased 8.5%. 
Net realized and unrealized losses after tax totaled $605 million for the quarter and comprised unrealized losses of $411 million relating to the investment portfolio, primarily due to rising interest rates; and realized losses of $109 million from the portfolio, primarily from sales of portfolio assets to fund the acquisition of Chubb. 
We also had foreign exchange losses of $138 million and a $55 million realized gain related to the mark on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. 
You can see on our balance sheet that short-term investments and cash increased $9.4 billion from September 30. This includes the proceeds of our debt issuance and funds from the liquidation of investment portfolios in preparation for the closing of Chubb.
Our year-end investment portfolio exposure to the energy sector totaled $1.87 billion, down from $3.2 billion in late 2014. When combined with the legacy Chubb portfolio, energy holdings totaled $2.4 billion or 2.3% of the combined portfolio, have an average rating of BBB and are well diversified, with over 200 issuers. We are comfortable with both the concentration and current valuation of our exposure to the energy sector, which is currently valued at approximately 92% of par. 
Our net loss reserves were up $275 million or 1% for the year, adjusted for foreign-exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 111% or 102% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior-period development and cross -- crop loss payments activity, which by the nature of the business, is heavy in the fourth quarter. For the year, our paid-to-incurred ratio is 92% and is more indicative of our trends. 
In the quarter, we had positive net prior-period development of $100 million pretax. In our active companies, we had $159 million of positive prior-period development, of which $45 million was from long-tail lines principally from 2009 and prior accident years. The remainder was from short-tail lines. 
In our Brandywine and other run-off operations, we strengthened reserves by $59 million pretax. The charge related to asbestos and comprised account-specific development and defense-related cost on existing accounts. We see no underlying change in the asbestos landscape, and the average indemnity severity for individual asbestos claims has remained stable.
Cat losses of $67 million after-tax were almost flat with last year's fourth quarter, with $24 million from the U.S., $15 million from Europe, $17 million from Latin America and $11 million from Asia. 
Fourth quarter life segment operating income was down versus prior year due to unfavorable claim reserve development in the combined U.S. operation of $11 million after tax in 2015 compared to positive development of $5 million in 2014. After the 2015 adjustment, the combined ratio for this business remains in the low 90s. Life operating income was also affected by the continued run-off of our variable annuity book, which was down $8 million from the prior year.
Our operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of $34 million in comparison to last year's fourth quarter and $119 million year-on-year. 
With respect to the new Chubb, we estimate an investment income run rate for a full quarter of approximately $810 million to $825 million. The first quarter may be modestly lower due to the timing of the close. We also expect a tax rate ranging from 16% to 18% for 2016. 
Beginning with the first quarter, we are planning additional financial reporting disclosure for the consolidated Chubb. We will provide additional detail around production and underwriting results from both personal lines and commercial lines in North America insurance. And in overseas general insurance, we will provide an aggregate breakdown by region. We will also provide more detail on written and earned premium by line of business globally. We will issue information shortly that provides the format you can expect for our new disclosures. 
We will provide you with periodic updates on our estimated expense synergies and the estimated cost and timing to achieve both. As you will recall, our stated expense synergy target is $650 million annual run rate by the end of the third year. The current estimate of integration cost is $535 million, with an additional $100 million in branding-related expenses. 
When we present our operating income in the future, we will exclude the positive impact of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on a Chubb debt we acquired in the transaction and the negative effect of the amortization of the purchase accounting premium on the investment portfolio we acquired. We will also exclude, as we have to date, onetime integration costs associated with the transaction. We don't believe these items reflect our ongoing operations. All other purchase accounting intangible amortization will be included in operating income. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

And we want to grow, and that business has growth potential in important areas of the world over a period of time, over any reasonable period of time, and we intend to pursue that rigorously. I would like to see the percentage of A&H grow as a percentage of the company's business. That means that great A&H business is growing faster than everything else and that would be terrific. And that would -- that is Ed Clancy's mission in life, just to get that done. But I want to address yours about stability because I think there is -- I think while that is true on one hand, let's not miss what legacy Chubb is bringing to Legacy ACE, and that is very stable U.S. businesses. The middle market, agency commercial business and the small commercial business that they write has a signature to it. When you look at revenue and profit and loss of that business, that has -- represents great stability and is a real ballast. I think while you don't compare and contrast one to the other precisely, they're different businesses. Let's not forget that and the quality that, that brings. On the personal lines business, the high net worth personal lines business, I would make the same statement. And finally, what I'd say to you is we become the largest professional lines writer in the world. D&O, E&O, lots of classes of each, but particularly, that Chubb portfolio of professional lines. Unlike ACE that was at the upper middle market and large account end, that has a little bit of a more -- a greater volatility signature to it, pattern to it. But the Chubb portfolio is in more middle market and small account related. Tremendous business, a franchise virtually impossible to duplicate in any short period of time by anyone. So when you think about that A&H, I wish you would think about the totality of the business spread of what the new organization becomes. I hope that helps you."

It inspires confidence and financial services in who you do business with. First and foremost, the grease of that is confidence. And so I think that you can't get away from that. That will manifest itself around the world in different ways. In the short term, one of the things that we know that is always true that companies do to compete and maintain a competitive profile is they just -- they become a little less disciplined in underwriting, and it'll show up in pricing and terms and conditions. And if you want to simply defend what you got at all cost or you have less command and control because you're just not operating as well as you might, well, that, in the short term, can actually be to our detriment. Like a wounded animal out there, sometimes, stay out of the way. And that, I would suggest to you, is a little bit of the dynamic in the short term that we see, and we're disciplined guys.

We each review our -- all of our portfolios on a regular basis. We each have outside actuaries review our portfolios as well as our independent auditors.

The VA is in run-off and you'll see a -- as you know, as you rightly know, you're just going to see a natural decline in income. On the other side of the coin, international life is growing and it's -- I told you that its income will emerge over the next few years and cast  a bigger shadow. And this year, its business will continue -- will produce -- should produce an increasing profit as the year goes along. But what has been impacting international life, no different than our international P&C business, is foreign exchange. And we just don't control the foreign exchange market. So I can't predict that part, but I don't believe you're going to see, going forward, the same kind of impact year-on-year for foreign exchange that we saw in '15 because I don't think the dollar is going to continue strengthening to the degree that it did. I don't think anyone does. So that will benefit. Combined is growing in North America. We did have some noise around -- this year around reserves for the prior because the development showed that it -- we maybe underpegged its loss ratio in a couple of prior years, but the margin is healthy on that business. And you're comparing a year-on-year when in fact we had releases from prior years. And -- but I think that business is growing as we've showed you. And I think its margin over a period of time is pretty stable and so it will naturally have a growth in earnings. I can't tell you what quarter that happens. So I imagine that in total, the earnings, as we look forward in the life business, will, from quarter-to-quarter, as the year goes along, improve. Not dramatically, but improve. And I think that trend of VA going down but international life's earnings emerging, that part will accelerate over the next couple of years. Does that help you?"

This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company as the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.Our earnings for the quar",1883,"Good morning. This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company as the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.
Our earnings for the quarter were very good, while our premium revenue results were somewhat impacted by market conditions, foreign exchange and the merger, and I will explain.
On a reported basis, after-tax operating income for the quarter was over $1 billion or $2.26 per share compared to $2.25 per share prior year. 
Since we closed on January 14, our reported results were missing 2 weeks of Legacy Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, when adjusted for that 2 weeks stub period, operating income was in fact $229 million per share as compared to $225 million last year, quite good. 
When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the underlying health of the company, it's more insightful for you and relevant if we compare the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and one-time merger-related items that distort underwriting, to the 15-year first quarter as if we were one company since January 1, 2015.  As an operator, this is the way I look at our results. Therefore, on a pro forma apples-to-apples basis, the new Chubb produced simply excellent underwriting results highlighted by a calendar year P&C combined ratio of 88.9% and $720 million of P&C underwriting income. That was up 23% from prior year first quarter. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 88 8. Pretax cat losses of $258 million in the quarter were lower than pro forma prior-year by $57 million. 
Positive prior-period reserve development of $247 million pretax was up $55 million versus prior year. Our global P&C, which excludes agriculture and our agriculture business produced excellent calendar year and accident year underwriting results. 
Net investment income for the full quarter was $812 million, again on a pro forma basis. This is a good result, given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates, and it was right in line with our expectations.
Book value per share was up 10% in the quarter and stands at 98.85, while per share tangible book value declined as expected, reflecting the dilution from the acquisition. 
If the acquisition had closed December 31, so again, on a pro forma basis, tangible book grew 4%. 
Our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 10.2%. Bill will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior period reserve development and cat.
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, global P&C net premiums written, which excludes agriculture, were down 1% in constant dollars or $65 million. 
Foreign exchange impact and premium revenue results in the quarter by about fuller 4 [ph] points. Renewal retention rates were very good, so the impact to growth was mostly new business-related. As expected, market conditions have grown more competitive around the globe and that impacted us. I will speak about that later. 
With the acquisition closing mid-January, there were also many merger-related activities in the fourth quarter and January February, with employees focused on executing integration and learning the new organization. However, we are moving past this and will continue to do so.
We had improved new business growth in March and then April, momentum is building. And to the extent premium revenue was impacted by the integration, we are expecting improved growth.
Let me give you some more detail of our pro forma premium revenue results by major division, beginning with North America.
For all of North America, including our commercial P&C business, agriculture and personal lines, net premiums written were down about 1.8% in the quarter. 
Let me break that down. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market and small commercial enterprises, net premiums were down 2%. The renewal retention rate is measured by premium was a solid 87%. Renewal pricing was flat in the quarter and both exposure growth and rates were essentially flat. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%. Financial lines pricing was up about 2 and property-related pricing was down 1%. New business writings were down 4% year-on-year.
In our businesses serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we collectively call major accounts and specialty, net premiums were down 5%. For our retail broker distributed major accounts business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium, was a very strong 91.5%. 
Pricing for the business we wrote over all was down 1%. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down 2% and property-related pricing was down about 4.5%.
New business writings were down 32% year-on-year, impacted by market conditions plus merger-related focus, particularly again in January and February. New business activity in this division has, in fact, improved in March and April.
Our North America personal lines business had a reasonably good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant dollars. Excluding the impact of Fireman's Fund, growth was over 3%, rates were up 1% and the exposure change was a positive 3.7%. 
Net premiums for our agriculture business were down 27% for the quarter, primarily due to the premium gain loss sharing formulas with the U.S. government with the '15 crop year, which, by the way, was an excellent underwriting year. 
In fact, as we begin this year's growing season and as far as we can tell, we have gained market share and the number of farms we will be ensuring may very well be at an all-time high.
Turning to our International business, results were pretty good and, in fact, better than we planned. Net premiums written for our global retail P&C business were up in the quarter nearly 4% in constant dollars. Growth variability, depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 6%, Latin America was up 4% and Europe was up 2%.
From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, which was a bit slower than expected. A&H grew 3% and personal lines grew a strong 12%. 
In our London market-based E&S on excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 12% due totally to market conditions. 
Just as an FYI, as contemplated by us when we initially planned the merger in '16 and '17, we planned to shed or shrink net written premiums in certain portfolios simply because we cannot earn adequate underwriting returns or because we want to introduce net cap-related exposures. These actions will benefit both the returns and the risk-reward profile of the company. We will update you periodically as to the impact this has on our net written premium growth rates. This will be in addition to the business as usual underwriting actions we take as market conditions warrant.
Concerning market conditions, we are seeing a really great response from agents, brokers and customers all over the world and in all regions of the U.S. about the new Chubb. On the one hand, for agents, the combination of our commitment to the independent agency system, the service levels and attention they are experiencing and the new products and capabilities we are and plan to bring to them are creating a lot of excitement and good will. For brokers and large account clients, the size and quality of our balance sheet, our enhanced global capabilities, both service and product related, our consistency and focus in contrast to the problems they are experiencing with others are all attracting more opportunity and our pipeline is building. 
I might add the continuity of the employees our agents and brokers are working with at the local, regional and home office levels is both confidence building and much valued both our agents and brokers. This includes our outstanding claims and loss control organization, which hasn't missed a beat in terms of responsiveness.
The pricing environment continues to grow incrementally more competitive, particularly in shorter tail lines. And again, it really varied, depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. 
As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized, wholesale is more competitive than retail and property is certainly more competitive than casualty related. Both casualty pricing in the main is not keeping pace with loss cost trends. None of this is a surprise. 
During the quarter, for our large middle market commercial business, pricing was marginally better than we had anticipated. And for major accounts, about in line with expectations.
John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump, can provide further color on the quarter in current market conditions and pricing trends. 
On another subject. Enabling integration-related savings and the one-time cost associated with realizing them. As we continue to do our work, we are providing an update to our initial disclosures regarding value creation and efficiencies. 
In terms of integration-related savings, we are now projecting to exceed our original target of $650 million or $610 million at current foreign exchange rates and expect an annualized run rate of approximately $750 million by year end '18. 
Total one-time cost related to the merger are expected to be $811 million and consist of one-time expenses of high 525 directly attributable to achieving the 750 savings and other one-time expenses of 2 86 related to the merger, such as transaction cost, branding  and employee retention costs.
In addition, as a result of the merger, by the fourth quarter, we are also now projecting an improvement to our annualized investment income run rate of $100 million to $120 million in what we would otherwise earn as we improve investment portfolio management. Bill will have more to say, including the timing by year for achieving integration-related savings and the related cost as well as the timing for achieving the improved investment income run rate and how you should think about that.
We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process, people, technology and growth initiatives, are at a very early stage. 
Integration is going as expected, including cultural integration, which is going well. As we've said from the beginning, you just don't wave a wand and put 2 strong cultures together. It takes some time. It's a process that you pay attention to, that you care about and that you lead.
While there are some differences between our 2 cultures, they are not . We are far more alike than different. As we focus on day-to-day business activities, we are breeding familiarity and meeting ourselves together in every level of the company. All employees, starting with leadership, are invested and paying attention. 
Our organization is stable and, in fact, it is doing well. Our people are more and more engaged and focused on serving clients, writing business and overall value creation. Again, client retention is excellent and customer and distribution partner reception in the marketplace has been outstanding. 
In sum, we're off to a really good start and the value creation that will come from our company is greater than we imagined when we announced the acquisition. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and we're going to take your questions."
203028,328783099,974349,"Chubb Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balanced sheet to support our business activities around the globe with total capital exceeding $59 bi",983,"Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balanced sheet to support our business activities around the globe with total capital exceeding $59 billion. Our loss reserves are conservative and in great shape.  We have a $99 billion portfolio of cash and investments that's highly rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial positive cash flow. 
Adjusted net income was $767 million in the quarter. This was within our expectations when factoring in the 14 days of investment income prior to the close of the acquisition on January 14, which amounts to approximately $45 million.
As Evan noted, we've analyzed the investment portfolio and believe that through more active management, we can raise the run rate of investment income higher than it otherwise would have been by approximately $100 million to $120 million annually without taking any significant additional risk.
We plan to maintain a high level of quality with our AA rating and keep duration at approximately 4 years.
This increase in investment income, together with future operating cash flow, will help to offset the natural impact of reinvestment at low money rates. Our current book yield on the portfolio is 3.4% and new money rates are 2.5%.
Before the improvements in investment portfolio management, we would've expected the quarterly investment income to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Now with the improvements, we expect quarterly investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million for the balance of the year. 
As a reminder, the estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability and portfolio rates, productivity, private equity distributions and foreign-exchange. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $952 million pretax and include a $846 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from a decline in interest rates; a $244 million mark-to-market loss on our BA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates; and a $350 million gain from FX. 
Before you ask, hedge fund investments represent less than 1/2 of 1% of our portfolio. They have never been a significant part of our strategy. 
Operating income, operating cash flow for the quarter was a little over $1 billion and $1.3 billion when adjusted for the 14 days stub period and one-time merger-related costs.
Tangible book value per share was down 25.5%, reflecting the expected dilution of 29% at the acquisition close, offset by our strong earnings and a net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. 
Net loss reserves increased $21.4 billion for the quarter, largely due to the Chubb acquisition. On a pro forma basis, loss reserves increased $125 million, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 92%. 
Cat losses for the quarter were $258 million pretax, primarily from U.S. weather events. Prior period reserved development was positive $247 million pretax and comprised of $135 million of long-tail lines, principally from 2007 [ph]  And prior and $112 million from short-tail lines. 
The positive short tail development includes $41 million relating to agriculture for the settlement of the 2015 crop year. 
Our life segment earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million after tax of unfavorable claim reserved development in our U.S. combined insurance operations and the run-off of our VA reinsurance book.
Our press release includes a table showing our expectations for the amount and timing of the recognition of integration savings and one-time integration expenses over the 2016, '17 and '18 years. We also include the annualized run rate for savings we will achieve by the end of each year. 
For 2016, we expect the expenses to be weighted more heavily to the first half of the year and the savings to be weighted to the second half.
Our tax rate on operating income from the quarter is 16.5%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. 
Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. For example, the first quarter tax rate is at the low end of the range due to the timing of the integration savings, which again are weighted to the second half of the year and front end purchase accounting amortization.
In additional color, embedded in our annual effective tax rate estimate is the impact of our higher debt leverage. As part of the transaction, we have an intercompany loan that benefits our tax expense by $19 million in the quarter. We are comfortable that the loan will not be affected by the recent treasury guidelines. 
The combination of our internal and external financing of the Chubb acquisition favorably impacts the annual effective tax rate by approximately 2 points, which then contemplated in the range that I noted.
Lastly, I'll point out that we have added some disclosures this quarter as highlighted in our 8 8-K filing last week. We now show our North America personalized business as a separate segment, and we're providing premium information for the regions of our overseas general insurance segment. We plan to provide a global line of business with the premium chart in the second quarter. We've also provided pro forma underwriting information for 2016 and '15 at just 16 [ph] without purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb transaction and includes the 14 days of January before the acquisition closing for comparative purposes. 
As a reminder, when estimating our net written premium growth for the second quarter, last year's quarter included $252 million of one-time benefit from Fireman's Fund that will not repeat. Therefore, we're having reference to improve net written premium growth that we expect in the second quarter. That growth is over a 2015 base that does not include the one-time Fireman's Fund benefit. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

We imagined that as a result of putting 3 of the 4 major players and high net worth together is that you would, ultimately, read additional competitors in that space and I've said that from the beginning. And that this a healthy thing. The market needs choice, number one. Number two, the -- it isn't about the roughly $10 billion high net worth market or $8 billion, or whatever it is, that exists today. It's about the market that we imagine is in the $30 billion or $40 billion range of those who require or really need a richer product that is rich in service, rich and coverage, rich in benefits and more about service and benefits than it is about price. And those individuals who have a lifestyle and assets to protect are ensured in more standard lines companies right now, and the long-term play is to attract them and serve them in the high net worth market. So that's the real play.  What I'd say about competition is pretty simple. So step up to the standards and the level that Chubb represents, which is the gold standard of the business. Requires years of investment and attention. You don't do something like this overnight. The capabilities you have to bring in terms of service capabilities, both risk and engineering services to individual customers, and the claims service capabilities, and the riches of the coverages and the ability to service of them all over the globe, well, I'll tell you what, that's not an easy lift. And you win these customers one by one and the average premiums can vary anywhere from $5,000 to couple of hundred thousand dollars. It's hard work. So to anybody entering the space, it is a good business. And if you do it right, it takes a lot of patience, a lot of capital and good luck. And, by the way, we'll put the welcome out for you."

The middle-market new business was down about 4%. Large count was down in around 30%. January was a much tougher month in terms of new business then February and March was better and April was better than March as we go forward. So we know a combination of things as we look at it. Definitely there was -- it was a more competitive environment in January. In January, it's always a competitive month relative to other months. Matter of fact, I have to tell you, the softer part of cycle, you better off to try to break new business in the off months of a quarter. January is tough. April can be tough, March, April. And June, July is like January the way people go after it. And they have some growth objectives that they want to achieve. So there was some impact from that and we see that. But in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of people. We focused for 6 months very intensely on planning the merger. And there was sort of 11 power generous people as we come up to close and everybody is focused on to a degree of the integration and the structure and who am I working for and what is my job. And then the integration itself, all the planning of that. It just takes time and it's some time away from working on new business. And January, a new degree. February is impacted by your activities in the fourth quarter, which is November, December. And then we close the middle of January, so everybody don't have to execute. And there was just a mountain of execution when you take it by function, by area of business, by geography all over the world. And I'm very proud about how we've executed because people have done it. It's been in a -- there hasn't been a lot of surprises. There -- everybody is knowing what to do and it's gone very smoothly. And we've been -- and then people have been -- spent a lot of time getting to know each other and getting to know what the capabilities were and learning the products of each other before you can take it out the market. And we could really begin to feel that start to take hold in February, moving to March. And as it moves in April, it just keeps on building. So maybe that gives you a little sense."

Don't try to corner it. On the other hand -- look, we represent, and that's what I tried to say in my commentaries. We represent a very attractive market and alternative through large accounts seeking a deep balanced sheet, great underwriting expertise, as you know, great reputation for service, global capability, broad product offering and services. There are -- and, by the way, which has become more and more the play in large account business. Your technology, your ability to deliver in a way that served the service standards are met, the service expectations are met. And no standards of service have only risen the expectations of all risen over the last decade, in the last 5 years, in  3 years. People expect great data, great information, very rapid -- excel served way where they can serve themselves. We have that technology. Very few have that. Our ability to move money, our ability to service self-insurance, our ability to risk engineer, our ability to provide primary casualty coverages, including professional lines all over the world and service claims. Very few can do that. And we have been stable in terms of our capacity offering and our approach to underwriting and our pricing. Sometimes the market moves closer to us when the market is more disciplined in terms of underwriting. Sometimes the market moves further away from us because others are willing to sell something at a price we consider too cheap or at terms we consider too broad. So one hand we're in a market where it's competitive and some things are being sold at prices that are below cost we think are reasonable.  On the other hand, there is this pulling desire for stability, and certainty and familiarity, and that is drawing more towards us. So I can tell you, we just came back from all of us there. I have not seen a reception towards our company in -- towards this company. I only have ever seen a reception like I saw at RIMS. We are really popular kids on campus."

I think there's a naïve about all of that and I think that's wrong. Our approach is to earn an adequate risk-adjusted returns in the business. The business does that reasonably well today. There is a lot of risk in the business. The business is regulated. You have to file your rates. And they have to be just as the justified, and we do that. And that adds complexity, but adds stability as well. Secondly, we want to win customers by offering a great service at a fair price, and hardly do we want to try to push it where we make money simply on trying to make more money on the cohort we have or rather growth cohort if we're making an adequate risk-adjusted. So with all of that, what I'd say to you is we see stability as we look forward in the margins in the business.

So I -- I can't -- if you're looking for a point estimate, a numeric estimate of what was specifically integration related versus market related, I can't give you that. Nobody does of that. But I can tell you that the market, market discipline, for those who are disciplined in underwriting, absolutely is having an impact on growth rate and you could see that as you look at players who reported. And that definitely has an impact on us. And you know there were times, and I've said this, been very clear, that there are times that revenue is for vanity. And revenue growth is for vanity and it's best you take your eye off of that. And there are pockets of the business, any pockets of the business where I and my colleagues think that it's not an overly attractive market and you better discriminate very carefully what you choose to write and how you choose to write it. And if you want to maintain underwriting margins and that's our first objective. So I will shed revenue without a tier in any class, in any line of business when we can't make an underwriting profit. Period. And you know that. The retention rates were very high. And that, to me, shows me the market reaction towards us. And the demand for business from Chubb, from doing business with Chubb, by both distribution customers and the good work of our people. When I look at the pattern of new business, I mean, how we came in and where it came in and the timing of it, it's very clear to me that the integration, and in discussions with our people, that the integration had an impact. And when I look at how we're moving month-to-month, I can see that beginning to recede And people really getting on without getting out there and driving for it.  So I see a combination of both impacting it. I can't do anything about the market and that will be what it will be. But I can tell you getting the organization focused, that is something we can do, something about and we're all focused on that. Everyone is out there. We've been to many regions, to many offices. On working with our people and helping them to get on the front foot, and I feel really good about the energy level and the focus of the organization that is taking hold.

Obviously, we all think it is a growth company, but with the moving pieces of the market and integration, it was obviously a flat quarter. When you have a look across the portfolio and sort of looked a couple of years out, what kind of long-term organic growth rates do you guys think are potential?

And the way, therefore, we define growth across a company for us. A growth company in this business is growth in book value and tangible book value. That's how you define growth in a risk business. Not the revenue growth, which is an overly simplistic way.  Ultimately, you have to gain revenue growth as well. So I reject that notion of what's a growth company. Number two, we will -- we don't give guidance, and so I'm not going to start giving guidance about revenue growth. But I will say this to you. I firmly believe that whatever the growth rate was projected, and at ACE, we do long term -- at ACE, we did long term 5-year plans. We move forward every year. And we had a projection of what we thought our growth rates would be over a coming 5-year period. I have a sense of what Chubb -- Legacy Chubb would've thought of its growth potential over a 2 to 3-year period. I would have seen.  I do firmly believe that when you sum those 2 together, the 2 together will have greater growth than the 2 would -- the sum of the 2 separately would. There is little doubt of that in my mind. How significant? We have ranges internally from what we think might be conservative to what we think might be more aggressive when. But when I pitch it up in the middle, I think it will be meaningful. And I did say that I thought that by the fifth year, it would come into the billions of dollars range and multiples of billions and I believe that from what it otherwise would be. And while that's not a -- what you wanted as an answer from me specifically, I hope that gives you some insight."

What I love is the balance of business in this company by geography. When I look at opportunities through Asia, when I look at opportunities in Latin America, when I look at opportunities through the United States, and I just geographically, I see -- and in Europe, I see so much room to move where there are some territories and some lines of business that you know to maintain margin, you need to shrink. I see other areas where we have the capabilities, we have the presence and execution to grow in those areas. And when you have the data we have and the knowledge we have, putting that to work, it is a job of execution at that point. When I look at our spread of business by type of business, by customer, from large segment where it's obviously, except for the dislocation of others that put some wind in your back, it's obviously the more difficult area to grow. And in fact, you're going to go sideways or shrink it in many areas of that business if you're going to maintain underwriting discipline. But I then look on the other side of the coin at the middle market and the capabilities we have in that area, and our reputation in our relationships, and our ability to drive more product and grow that more quickly, that just gives me a lot of optimism. I look at our A&H business around on the world. I look at our personal lines business, both in the United States and outside the U.S. and potential in that area. I add it all up and there are areas where you apply the gas and there are areas where you apply the brake. And we know how to do that quite well. And as I said, I will never get baited into revenue growth on -- to maintain margins. And when my guys are feeling a little bad because they have to shed business to maintain margin, I got to tell you what, I suck it up and I cheer lead them because it's the right thing to do."

And then on the other side of the coin where we talk about Legacy Chubb as being star of the -- i that's right. On one hand, it's technology and so you invest in technology.

As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.Our earnings for the quarte",1868,"Good morning. This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company, the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.
Our earnings for the quarter were very good, while our premium revenue results were somewhat impacted by market conditions, foreign exchange and the merger. And I will explain.
On a reported basis, after-tax operating income for the quarter was over $1 billion or $2.26 per share compared to $2.25 per share prior year.  Since we closed on January 14, our reported results are missing 2 weeks of legacy Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, when adjusted for that 2 weeks stub period, operating income was, in fact, $2.29 per share as compared to $2.25 last year. Quite good. 
When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the underlying health of the company, it's more insightful for you and relevant if we compare the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items that distort underwriting, to the '15 year first quarter as if we were one company since January 1, 2015. As an operator, this is the way I look at our results. Therefore, on a pro forma apples-to-apples basis, the new Chubb produced simply excellent underwriting results, highlighted by a calendar year P&C combined ratio of 88.9% and $720 million of P&C underwriting income. That was up 23% from prior year first quarter. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 88.8%. Pretax cat losses of $258 million in the quarter were lower than pro forma prior year by $57 million.  Positive prior-period reserve development of $247 million pretax was up $55 million versus prior year. Both Global P&C, which excludes Agriculture, and our Agriculture business produced excellent calendar year and accident year underwriting results. 
Net investment income for the full quarter was $812 million, again, on a pro forma basis. This is a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates, and it was right in line with our expectations.
Book value per share was up 10% in the quarter and stands at $98.85, while per-share tangible book value declined as expected, reflecting the dilution from the acquisition. If the acquisition had closed December 31, so again, on a pro forma basis, tangible book grew 4%. 
Our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 10.2%. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development and cat.
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, Global P&C net premiums written, which excludes Agriculture, were down 1% in constant dollars or $65 million. Foreign exchange impacted premium revenue results in the quarter by about 4 points. Renewal retention rates were very good, so the impact to growth was mostly new business-related. As expected, market conditions have grown more competitive around the globe, and that impacted us. I will speak about that later. 
With the acquisition closing mid-January, there were also many merger-related activities in the fourth quarter and January/February, with employees focused on executing integration and learning the new organization. However, we are moving past this and will continue to do so. We had improved new business growth in March and then April. Momentum is building, and to the extent premium revenue was impacted by the integration, we are expecting improved growth.
Let me give you some more detail of our pro forma premium revenue results by major division, beginning with North America. For all of North America, including our Commercial P&C business, Agriculture and Personal Lines, net premiums written were down about 1.8% in the quarter. 
Let me break that down. In our retail Commercial P&C business that serves the middle market and small commercial enterprises, net premiums were down 2%. The renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was a solid 87%. Renewal pricing was flat in the quarter, and both exposure growth and rates were essentially flat. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%. Financial lines pricing was up about 2%, and property-related pricing was down 1%. New business writings were down 4% year-on-year.
In our businesses serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we collectively call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down 5%. For our retail broker-distributed Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was a very strong 91.5%. Pricing for the business we wrote overall was down 1%. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down 2%, and property-related pricing was down about 4.5%.
New business writings were down 32% year-on-year, impacted by market conditions plus merger-related focus, particularly, again, in January and February. New business activity in this division has, in fact, improved in March and April.
Our North America Personal Lines business had a reasonably good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant dollars. Excluding the impact of Fireman's Fund, growth was over 3%, rates were up 1%, and the exposure change was a positive 3.7%. 
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were down 27% for the quarter primarily due to the premium gain/loss sharing formulas with the U.S. government for the '15 crop year, which, by the way, was an excellent underwriting year. In fact, as we begin this year's growing season and as far as we can tell, we have gained market share, and the number of farms we will be insuring may very well be at an all-time high.
Turning to our international business. Results were pretty good and, in fact, better than we planned. Net premiums written for our global retail P&C business were up in the quarter nearly 4% in constant dollars. Growth varied depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 6%. Latin America was up 4%, and Europe was up 2%.  From a product perspective, Commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, which was a bit slower than expected. A&H grew 3%, and Personal Lines grew a strong 12%. 
In our London market-based E&S, excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 12% due totally to market conditions. Just as an FYI, as contemplated by us when we initially planned the merger, in '16 and '17, we plan to shed or shrink net written premiums in certain portfolios simply because we cannot earn adequate underwriting returns or because we want to reduce net cat-related exposures. These actions will benefit both the returns and the risk-reward profile of the company. We will update you periodically as to the impact this has on our net written premium growth rates. This will be in addition to the business-as-usual underwriting actions we take as market conditions warrant.
Concerning market conditions, we are seeing a really great response from agents, brokers and customers all over the world and in all regions of the U.S. about the new Chubb. On the one hand, for agents, the combination of our commitment to the independent agency system, the service levels and attention they are experiencing and the new products and capabilities we are and plan to bring to them are creating a lot of excitement and good will. For brokers and large account clients, the size and quality of our balance sheet, our enhanced global capabilities, both service- and product-related, our consistency and focus in contrast to the problems they are experiencing with others are all attracting more opportunity, and our pipeline is building. 
I might add, the continuity of the employees our agents and brokers are working with at the local, regional and home office levels is both confidence-building and much valued by both our agents and brokers. This includes our outstanding claims and loss control organization, which hasn't missed a beat in terms of responsiveness.
The pricing environment continues to grow incrementally more competitive, particularly in shorter tail lines. And again, it really varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. 
As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsize. Wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property is certainly more competitive than casualty-related. Though casualty pricing in the main is not keeping pace with loss cost trends. None of this is a surprise. 
During the quarter, for our large middle market commercial business, pricing was marginally better than we had anticipated and for Major Accounts, about in line with expectations.
John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
On another subject, namely integration-related savings and the onetime costs associated with realizing them. As we continue to do our work, we are providing an update to our initial disclosures regarding value creation and efficiencies. In terms of integration-related savings, we are now projecting to exceed our original target of $650 million, or $610 million at current foreign exchange rates, and expect an annualized run rate of approximately $750 million by year-end '18.  Total onetime costs related to the merger are expected to be $811 million and consist of onetime expenses of $525 million directly attributable to achieving the $750 million savings and other onetime expenses of $286 million related to the merger, such as transaction costs, branding and employee retention costs.
In addition, as a result of the merger, by the fourth quarter, we are also now projecting an improvement to our annualized investment income run rate of $100 million to $120 million in what we would otherwise earn as we improve investment portfolio management. Phil will have more to say, including the timing by year for achieving integration-related savings and the related costs as well as the timing for achieving the improved investment income run rate and how you should think about that.
We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process, people, technology and growth initiatives, which are at a very early stage. Integration is going as expected, including cultural integration, which is going well. As we've said from the beginning, you don't just wave a wand and put 2 strong cultures together. It takes some time. It's a process that you pay attention to, that you care about and that you lead.
While there are some differences between our 2 cultures, they are not profound. We are far more alike than different. As we focus on day-to-day business activities, we are breeding familiarity and knitting ourselves together at every level of the company. All employees, starting with leadership, are invested and paying attention. 
Our organization is stable, and in fact, it is doing well. Our people are more and more engaged and focused on serving clients, writing business and overall value creation. Again, client retention is excellent, and customer and distribution partner reception in the marketplace has been outstanding. 
In sum, we're off to a really good start, and the value creation that will come from our company is greater than we imagined when we announced the acquisition. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions."
203028,328783099,974804,"Chubb Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 bi",978,"Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 billion. Our loss reserves are conservative and in great shape.  We have a $99 billion portfolio of cash and investments that's highly rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial positive cash flow. 
Adjusted net investment income was $767 million in the quarter. This was within our expectations when factoring in the 14 days of investment income prior to the close of the acquisition on January 14, which amounts to approximately $45 million.
As Evan noted, we've analyzed the investment portfolio and believe that through more active management, we can raise the run rate of investment income higher than it otherwise would have been by approximately $100 million to $120 million annually without taking any significant additional risk. We plan to maintain a high level of quality with our AA rating and keep duration at approximately 4 years.
This increase in investment income, together with future operating cash flow, will help to offset the natural impact of reinvestment at lower new money rates. Our current book yield on the portfolio is 3.4%, and new money rates are 2.5%.
Before the improvements in investment portfolio management, we would have expected quarterly investment income to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Now with the improvements, we expect quarterly investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million for the balance of the year. As a reminder, the estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability in portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $952 million pretax and include an $846 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $244 million mark-to-market loss on our VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates; and a $350 million gain from FX.  Before you ask, hedge fund investments represent less than 1/2 of 1% of our portfolio. They have never been a significant part of our strategy. 
Operating income -- operating cash flow for the quarter was a little over $1 billion and $1.3 billion when adjusted for the 14-day stub period and onetime merger-related costs. Tangible book value per share was down 25.5%, reflecting the expected dilution of 29% at the acquisition close, offset by our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. 
Net loss reserves increased $21.4 billion for the quarter largely due to the Chubb acquisition. On a pro forma basis, loss reserves increased $125 million, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 92%. 
Cat losses for the quarter were $258 million pretax, primarily from U.S. weather events. Prior-period reserve development was positive $247 million pretax and comprised $135 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2010 and prior, and $112 million from short-tail lines.  The positive short-tail development includes $41 million relating to Agriculture for the settlement of the 2015 crop year. 
Our Life segment earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million after-tax of unfavorable claim reserve development in our U.S. combined insurance operations and the run-off of our VA reinsurance book.
Our press release includes a table showing our expectations for the amount and timing of the recognition of integration savings and onetime integration expenses over the 2016, '17 and '18 years. We also include the annualized run rate for savings we will achieve by the end of each year. For 2016, we expect the expenses to be weighted more heavily to the first half of the year and the savings to be weighted to the second half.
Our tax rate on operating income from the quarter is 16.5%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. For example, the first quarter tax rate is at the low end of the range due to the timing of the integration savings, which, again, are weighted to the second half of the year, and front-end purchase accounting amortization.
The additional color embedded in our annual effective tax rate estimate is the impact of our higher debt leverage. As part of the transaction, we have an intercompany loan that benefits our tax expense by $19 million in the quarter. We are comfortable that the loan will not be affected by the recent Treasury guidelines. The combination of our internal and external financing of the Chubb acquisition favorably impacts the annual effective tax rate by approximately 2 points, which is contemplated in the range that I noted.
Lastly, I'll point out that we have added some disclosures this quarter, as highlighted in our 8-K filing last week. We now show our North America Personal Lines business as a separate segment, and we're providing premium information for the regions of our Overseas General Insurance segment. We plan to provide a global line of business written premium chart in the second quarter. We have also provided pro forma underwriting information for 2016 and '15 that shows '16 without purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb transaction and includes the 14 days of January before the acquisition closing for comparative purposes. 
As a reminder, when estimating our net written premium growth for the second quarter, last year's quarter included $252 million of onetime benefit from Fireman's Fund that will not repeat. Therefore, when Evan referenced improved net written premium growth that we expect in the second quarter, that growth is over a 2015 base that does not include the onetime Fireman's Fund benefit. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

We imagined that as a result of putting 3 of the 4 major players in high net worth together, that you would ultimately breed additional competitors in that space. And I've said that from the beginning. And that is a healthy thing. The market needs choice, number one. Number two, it isn't about the roughly $10 billion high net worth market, or $8 billion or whatever it is, that exists today. It's about the market that we imagine is in the $30 billion or $40 billion range, those who require or really need a richer product that is rich in service, rich in coverage, rich in benefits and more about service and benefits than it is about price. And those individuals who have a lifestyle and assets to protect are insured in more standard lines companies right now. And the long-term play is to attract them and serve them in the high net worth market. So that's the real play. What I'd say about competition is pretty simple. To step up to the standards and the level that Chubb represents, which is the gold standard of the business, requires years of investment and attention. You don't build something like this overnight. The capabilities you have to bring in terms of service capabilities, both risk and engineering services to individual customers, and the claims service capabilities and the richness of the coverages and the ability to service them all over the globe, well, I'll tell you what, that's not an easy lift. And you win these customers one by one, and the average premiums can vary anywhere from $5,000 to couple of hundred thousand dollars. It's hard work. So to anybody entering the space, it is a good business. And if you do it right, it takes a lot of patience, a lot of capital and good luck. And by the way, we'll put the welcome mat out for you."

The middle market new business was down about 4%. Large account was down in around 30%. January was a much tougher month in terms of new business, then February and March was better, and April was better than March as we go forward. So we know a combination of things as we look at it. Definitely, there was -- it was a more competitive environment in January. And January is always a competitive month relative to other months. As a matter of fact, I have to tell you, in the softer part of the cycle, you're better off to try to write new business in the off months of a quarter. January is tough. April can be tough, March, April. And June, July is like January, the way people go after it. And they have some growth objectives that they want to achieve. So there was some impact from that, and we see that. But in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of people -- we focused for 6 months very intensely on planning the merger. And there were sort of 11th-hour jitters of people as we come up to close, and everybody is focused on to a degree of the integration and the structure and who am I working for and what is my job. And then the integration itself, all the planning of that, just takes time, and it's some time away from working on new business. And January, and to a degree, February, is impacted by your activities in the fourth quarter, which is November, December. And then we close the middle of January, so everybody then has to execute. And there is just a mountain of execution when you take it by function, by area of business, by geography all over the world. And I'm very proud about how we've executed because people have done it. It's been in a -- there haven't been a lot of surprises. Everybody's known what to do, and it's gone very smoothly. And we've been -- and then people have been -- spent a lot of time getting to know each other and getting to know what the capabilities were and learning the products of each other before you can take it out to market. And we could really begin to feel that start to take hold in February, move into March, and as it moves in April, it just keeps on building. So maybe that gives you a little sense."

And we have the distribution. We have the data and the know-how. And we have the insight. We have the focus. We have the resource that we're putting attention to. We have the roadmap for technology. And we're coming. And we are building right now and focused on building. We already had, between the organizations, a nascent, what I call nascent small commercial business, modest, very modest in size, and specialty-oriented. And that continues. Those efforts continue, and they have a reasonably aggressive plan in action, a set of actions to achieve results in '16. But that's not the main event for us. This is an $80 billion marketplace, and we intend, over the next number of years, to grow, to be a meaningful player. I might say, a little like I said about high net worth, you really have to -- it takes time to build capabilities, to build all the services and product know-how, to have the right insights into pricing and to execute because it's work-intensive. The average premium sizes are small. It's high transaction volume, and you got to win over and wire up the distribution. And we are focused on all of that. And so over the next few years, I expect that to grow and be a meaningful contributor to our business. And as time -- as it's appropriate, we will update you more specifically. Don't look for much out of me in '16."

We write cell phone insurance out in Asia, and that had nice growth. In Europe, we write cell phone-related insurance, and that had really nice growth. So it isn't from one place nor one geography.

Don't try to corner it. On the other hand -- look, we represent, and that's what I tried to say in my commentaries, we represent a very attractive market and alternative for large accounts seeking a deep balance sheet, great underwriting expertise, as you know, great reputation for service, global capability, broad product offering and services. There are -- and by the way, which has become more and more the play in large account business, your technology, your ability to deliver in a way that the service standards are met, the service expectations are met. And those standards of service have only risen. The expectations have only risen over the last decade, in the last 5 years and 3 years. People expect great data, great information in a very rapid way, self-served way, where they can serve themselves. We have that technology. Very few have that. Our ability to move money, our ability to service self-insureds, our ability to risk engineer, our ability to provide primary casualty coverages, including professional lines, all over the world and service claims, very few can do that. And we have been stable in terms of our capacity offering and our approach to underwriting and our pricing. Sometimes, the market moves closer to us when the market is more disciplined in terms of underwriting. Sometimes, the market moves further away from us because others are willing to sell something at a price we consider too cheap or at terms we consider too broad. So on one hand, we're in a market where it's competitive, and some things are being sold at prices that are below costs we think are reasonable.  On the other hand, there is this pull and desire for stability and certainty and familiarity, and that is drawing more towards us. So I can tell you we just came back from RIMS, all of us there. I have not seen a reception towards our company in -- towards this company, I don't think I've ever seen the reception like I saw at RIMS. We are really popular kids on campus."

On the domestic and margin, there's been questions to us of, well, now that you're so dominant in that business, we assume you're going to now, in a sense, be predatory, take advantage, raise prices, et cetera, increase margins. I think there's a naïveté about all of that, and I think that's wrong. Our approach is to earn an adequate risk-adjusted return in the business. The business does that reasonably well today. There is a lot of risk in the business. The business is regulated. You have to file your rates, and they have to be just -- they have to be actuarially justified, and we do that. And that adds a complexity but adds a stability as well. Secondly, we want to win customers by offering a great service at a fair price, and hardly do we want to try to push it where we make our money simply on -- try to make more money on the cohort we have rather than grow the cohort if we're making an adequate risk adjustment. So with all of that, what I'd say to you is we see stability as we look forward in the margins in the business. And we don't consider that we're making excessive returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, we are not. We're making reasonable returns."

So I can't -- if you're looking for a point estimate, a numeric estimate of what was specifically integration-related versus market-related, I can't give you that. Nobody knows that. But I can tell you that the market -- market discipline, for those who are disciplined in underwriting, absolutely is having an impact on growth rate, and you could see that as you look at players who've reported. And that definitely has an impact on us. And there were times -- and I've said this. I've been very clear that there are times that revenue is for vanity, and revenue growth is for vanity, and it's best you take your eye off of that. And there are pockets of the business, many pockets of the business where I and my colleagues think that it's not an overly attractive market, and you better discriminate very carefully on what you choose to write and how you choose to write it and if you want to maintain underwriting margins. And that's our first objective. So I will shed revenue without a tear in any class, in any line of business where we can't make an underwriting profit. Period. And you know that about us. The retention rates were very high. And that, to me, shows me the market reaction towards us and the demand for business from Chubb, from doing business with Chubb, by both distribution in customers and the good work of our people. When I look at the pattern of new business and how it came in and where it came in and the timing of it, it's very clear to me that the integration -- and in discussions with our people, that the integration had an impact. And when I look at how we're moving month to month, I can see that beginning to recede and people really getting on without getting out there and driving for it. So I see a combination of both impacting it. I can't do anything about the market, and that will be what it will be. But I can tell you getting the organization focused, that is something we can do something about, and we're all focused on that. Everyone is out there. We've been to many regions, to many offices, working with our people and helping them to get on the front foot.

Obviously, we all think of you as a growth company, but with the moving pieces of the market and integration, it was obviously a flat quarter. When you, Evan, look across the portfolio and sort of look a couple of years out, what kind of long-term organic growth rates do you guys think are potential? And I think this is an important question for us because it's hard to figure out from the outside given all the different growth businesses you have at legacy ACE and in combination with, obviously, the legacy Chubb opportunity. And I would really love to get a sense of what you're shooting for and what you think, maybe through the cycle, kind of long-term underlying organic growth potential might be."

First, you didn't define growth the way I define growth and the way, therefore, we define growth -- a growth company for us. A growth company in this business is growth in book value and tangible book value. That's how you define growth in a risk business, not revenue growth, which is an overly simplistic way. Ultimately, you have to gain revenue growth as well. So I reject that notion of what's a growth company. Number two, we will -- we don't give guidance, and so I'm not going to start giving guidance about revenue growth, but I will say this to you. I firmly believe that whatever the growth rate was projected, and at ACE, we do long-term -- at ACE, we did long-term 5-year plans. We would roll forward every year. And we had a projection of what we thought our growth rates would be over a coming 5-year period. I have a sense of what Chubb -- legacy Chubb would have thought of its growth potential over a 2- to 3-year period and what they would have seen. I do firmly believe that when you sum those 2 together, the 2 together will have greater growth than the 2 would -- the sum of the 2 separately would. There is little doubt of that in my mind. How significant? We have ranges internally from what we think might be conservative to what we think might be more aggressive. But when I pitch it up the middle, I think it will be meaningful. And I did say that I thought that by the fifth year, it would come into the billions of dollars range and multiples of billions, and I believe that, from what it otherwise would be. And while that's not a -- what you wanted as an answer from me specifically, I hope that gives you some insight."

What I love is the balance of business in this company by geography. When I look at opportunities through Asia, when I look at opportunities in Latin America, when I look at opportunities through the United States and I just look geographically, I see -- and in Europe, I see so much room to move where there are some territories and some lines of business that, to maintain margin, you need to shrink. I see other areas where we have the capabilities, we have the presence and it's about execution to grow in those areas. And when you have the data we have and the knowledge we have, putting that to work, it is a job of execution at that point. When I look at our spread of business by type of business, by customer, from large segment where it's obviously, except for the dislocation of others that put some wind at your back, it's obviously the more difficult area to grow, and in fact, you're going to go sideways or shrink it in many areas of that business if you're going to maintain underwriting discipline. But I then look on the other side of the coin at the middle market and the capabilities we have in that area and our reputation and our relationships and our ability to drive more product and grow that more quickly, that just gives me a lot of optimism. I look at our A&H business around the world. I look at our Personal Lines business, both in the United States and outside the U.S., and potential in that area. I add it all up, and there are areas where you apply the gas, and there are areas where you apply the brake. And we know how to do that quite well. And as I said, I will never get baited into revenue growth to maintain margins. And when my guys are feeling a little bad because they have to shed business to maintain margin, I got to tell you what, I suck it up and I cheerlead it because it's the right thing to do."

You then have some investments you make in new businesses, so small commercial, as an example. Or maybe you're expanding your cyber business or other businesses, and those will take investments. And then on the other side of the coin where -- we talk about legacy Chubb as being starved in some ways, and I think that's right. On one hand, it's technology, and so you invest in technology. But there, you have a cash spend, but you then capitalize and amortize over many years, so that impact will not be as you would imagine, sort of $1 of expense and $1 drops to the bottom. But you got a cash flow, and then you have an amortization of it. So those are what draws away from expense save and from the direct -- coming directly all to the bottom."

This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company, the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.Our earnings for the quarte",1869,"Good morning. This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company, the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done.
Our earnings for the quarter were very good, while our premium revenue results were somewhat impacted by market conditions, foreign exchange and the merger. And I will explain.
On a reported basis, after-tax operating income for the quarter was over $1 billion or $2.26 per share compared to $2.25 per share prior year.  Since we closed on January 14, our reported results are missing 2 weeks of legacy Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, when adjusted for that 2-week stub period, operating income was, in fact, $2.29 per share as compared to $2.25 last year. Quite good. 
When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the underlying health of the company, it's more insightful for you and relevant if we compare the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items that distort underwriting, to the '15 year first quarter as if we were one company since January 1, 2015. As an operator, this is the way I look at our results. Therefore, on a pro forma apples-to-apples basis, the new Chubb produced simply excellent underwriting results, highlighted by a calendar year P&C combined ratio of 88.9% and $720 million of P&C underwriting income. That was up 23% from prior year first quarter. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 88.8%. Pretax cat losses of $258 million in the quarter were lower than pro forma prior year by $57 million.  Positive prior-period reserve development of $247 million pretax was up $55 million versus prior year. Both Global P&C, which excludes Agriculture, and our Agriculture business, produced excellent calendar year and accident year underwriting results. 
Net investment income for the full quarter was $812 million, again, on a pro forma basis. This is a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates, and it was right in line with our expectations.
Book value per share was up 10% in the quarter and stands at $98.85, while per-share tangible book value declined as expected, reflecting the dilution from the acquisition. If the acquisition had closed December 31, so again, on a pro forma basis, tangible book grew 4%. 
Our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 10.2%. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development and cat.
Turning to revenue growth for the quarter. On a pro forma basis, Global P&C net premiums written, which excludes Agriculture, were down 1% in constant dollars or $65 million. Foreign exchange impacted premium revenue results in the quarter by about 4 points. Renewal retention rates were very good, so the impact to growth was mostly new business related. As expected, market conditions have grown more competitive around the globe, and that impacted us. I will speak about that later. 
With the acquisition closing mid-January, there were also many merger-related activities in the fourth quarter and January/February, with employees focused on executing integration and learning the new organization. However, we are moving past this and will continue to do so. We had improved new business growth in March and then April. Momentum is building, and to the extent premium revenue was impacted by the integration, we are expecting improved growth.
Let me give you some more detail of our pro forma premium revenue results by major division, beginning with North America. For all of North America, including our Commercial P&C business, Agriculture and Personal Lines, net premiums written were down about 1.8% in the quarter. 
Let me break that down. In our retail Commercial P&C business that serves the middle market and small commercial enterprises, net premiums were down 2%. The renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was a solid 87%. Renewal pricing was flat in the quarter, and both exposure growth and rates were essentially flat. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%. Financial lines pricing was up about 2%, and property-related pricing was down 1%. New business writings were down 4% year-on-year.
In our businesses serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we collectively call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down 5%. For our retail broker-distributed Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was a very strong 91.5%. Pricing for the business we wrote overall was down 1%. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down 2%, and property-related pricing was down about 4.5%.
New business writings were down 32% year-on-year, impacted by market conditions plus merger-related focus, particularly, again, in January and February. New business activity in this division has, in fact, improved in March and April.
Our North America Personal Lines business had a reasonably good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant dollars. Excluding the impact of Fireman's Fund, growth was over 3%, rates were up 1%, and the exposure change was a positive 3.7%. 
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were down 27% for the quarter, primarily due to the premium gain/loss sharing formulas with the U.S. government for the '15 crop year, which, by the way, was an excellent underwriting year. In fact, as we begin this year's growing season and as far as we can tell, we have gained market share, and the number of farms we will be insuring may very well be at an all-time high.
Turning to our international business. Results were pretty good and, in fact, better than we planned. Net premiums written for our global retail P&C business were up in the quarter nearly 4% in constant dollars. Growth varied depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 6%. Latin America was up 4%, and Europe was up 2%.  From a product perspective, Commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, which was a bit slower than expected. A&H grew 3%, and Personal Lines grew a strong 12%. 
In our London market-based E&S, excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 12% due totally to market conditions. Just as an FYI, as contemplated by us when we initially planned the merger, in '16 and '17, we plan to shed or shrink net written premiums in certain portfolios simply because we cannot earn adequate underwriting returns or because we want to reduce net cat-related exposures. These actions will benefit both the returns and the risk-reward profile of the company. We will update you periodically as to the impact this has on our net written premium growth rates. This will be in addition to the business-as-usual underwriting actions we take as market conditions warrant.
Concerning market conditions, we are seeing a really great response from agents, brokers and customers all over the world and in all regions of the U.S. about the new Chubb. On the one hand, for agents, the combination of our commitment to the independent agency system, the service levels and attention they are experiencing and the new products and capabilities we are and plan to bring to them are creating a lot of excitement and good will. For brokers and large account clients, the size and quality of our balance sheet, our enhanced global capabilities, both service and product related, our consistency and focus in contrast to the problems they are experiencing with others are all attracting more opportunity, and our pipeline is building. 
I might add, the continuity of the employees our agents and brokers are working with at the local, regional and home office levels is both confidence building and much valued by both our agents and brokers. This includes our outstanding claims and loss control organization, which hasn't missed a beat in terms of responsiveness.
The pricing environment continues to grow incrementally more competitive, particularly in shorter-tail lines. And again, it really varied depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. 
As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than midsize. Wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property is certainly more competitive than casualty-related. Though casualty pricing in the main is not keeping pace with loss cost trends. None of this is a surprise. 
During the quarter, for our large middle market commercial business, pricing was marginally better than we had anticipated, and for Major Accounts, about in line with expectations.
John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter and current market conditions and pricing trends. 
On another subject, namely integration-related savings and the onetime costs associated with realizing them. As we continue to do our work, we are providing an update to our initial disclosures regarding value creation and efficiencies. In terms of integration-related savings, we are now projecting to exceed our original target of $650 million, or $610 million at current foreign exchange rates, and expect an annualized run rate of approximately $750 million by year-end '18.  Total onetime costs related to the merger are expected to be $811 million and consist of onetime expenses of $525 million directly attributable to achieving the $750 million savings and other onetime expenses of $286 million related to the merger, such as transaction costs, branding and employee retention costs.
In addition, as a result of the merger, by the fourth quarter, we are also now projecting an improvement to our annualized investment income run rate of $100 million to $120 million in what we would otherwise earn as we improve investment portfolio management. Phil will have more to say, including the timing by year for achieving integration-related savings and the related costs as well as the timing for achieving the improved investment income run rate and how you should think about that.
We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process, people, technology and growth initiatives, which are at a very early stage. Integration is going as expected, including cultural integration, which is going well. As we've said from the beginning, you don't just wave a wand and put 2 strong cultures together. It takes some time. It's a process that you pay attention to, that you care about and that you lead.
While there are some differences between our 2 cultures, they are not profound. We are far more alike than different. As we focus on day-to-day business activities, we are breeding familiarity and knitting ourselves together at every level of the company. All employees, starting with leadership, are invested and paying attention. 
Our organization is stable, and in fact, it is doing well. Our people are more and more engaged and focused on serving clients, writing business and overall value creation. Again, client retention is excellent, and customer and distribution partner reception in the marketplace has been outstanding. 
In sum, we're off to a really good start, and the value creation that will come from our company is greater than we imagined when we announced the acquisition. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions."
203028,328783099,974888,"Chubb Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 bi",978,"Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 billion. Our loss reserves are conservative and in great shape.  We have a $99 billion portfolio of cash and investments that's highly rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial positive cash flow. 
Adjusted net investment income was $767 million in the quarter. This was within our expectations when factoring in the 14 days of investment income prior to the close of the acquisition on January 14, which amounts to approximately $45 million.
As Evan noted, we've analyzed the investment portfolio and believe that through more active management, we can raise the run rate of investment income higher than it otherwise would have been by approximately $100 million to $120 million annually without taking any significant additional risk. We plan to maintain a high level of quality with our AA rating and keep duration at approximately 4 years.
This increase in investment income, together with future operating cash flow, will help to offset the natural impact of reinvestment at lower new money rates. Our current book yield on the portfolio is 3.4%, and new money rates are 2.5%.
Before the improvements in investment portfolio management, we would have expected quarterly investment income to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Now with the improvements, we expect quarterly investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million for the balance of the year. As a reminder, the estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability in portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $952 million pretax and include an $846 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $244 million mark-to-market loss on our VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates; and a $350 million gain from FX.  Before you ask, hedge fund investments represent less than 1/2 of 1% of our portfolio. They have never been a significant part of our strategy. 
Operating income -- operating cash flow for the quarter was a little over $1 billion and $1.3 billion when adjusted for the 14-day stub period and onetime merger-related costs. Tangible book value per share was down 25.5%, reflecting the expected dilution of 29% at the acquisition close, offset by our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. 
Net loss reserves increased $21.4 billion for the quarter largely due to the Chubb acquisition. On a pro forma basis, loss reserves increased $125 million, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 92%. 
Cat losses for the quarter were $258 million pretax, primarily from U.S. weather events. Prior-period reserve development was positive $247 million pretax and comprised $135 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2010 and prior, and $112 million from short-tail lines.  The positive short-tail development includes $41 million relating to Agriculture for the settlement of the 2015 crop year. 
Our Life segment earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million after-tax of unfavorable claim reserve development in our U.S. combined insurance operations and the run-off of our VA reinsurance book.
Our press release includes a table showing our expectations for the amount and timing of the recognition of integration savings and onetime integration expenses over the 2016, '17 and '18 years. We also include the annualized run rate for savings we will achieve by the end of each year. For 2016, we expect the expenses to be weighted more heavily to the first half of the year and the savings to be weighted to the second half.
Our tax rate on operating income from the quarter is 16.5%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. For example, the first quarter tax rate is at the low end of the range due to the timing of the integration savings, which, again, are weighted to the second half of the year, and front-end purchase accounting amortization.
The additional color embedded in our annual effective tax rate estimate is the impact of our higher debt leverage. As part of the transaction, we have an intercompany loan that benefits our tax expense by $19 million in the quarter. We are comfortable that the loan will not be affected by the recent Treasury guidelines. The combination of our internal and external financing of the Chubb acquisition favorably impacts the annual effective tax rate by approximately 2 points, which is contemplated in the range that I noted.
Lastly, I'll point out that we have added some disclosures this quarter, as highlighted in our 8-K filing last week. We now show our North America Personal Lines business as a separate segment, and we're providing premium information for the regions of our Overseas General Insurance segment. We plan to provide a global line of business written premium chart in the second quarter. We have also provided pro forma underwriting information for 2016 and '15 that shows '16 without purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb transaction and includes the 14 days of January before the acquisition closing for comparative purposes. 
As a reminder, when estimating our net written premium growth for the second quarter, last year's quarter included $252 million of onetime benefit from Fireman's Fund that will not repeat. Therefore, when Evan referenced improved net written premium growth that we expect in the second quarter, that growth is over a 2015 base that does not include the onetime Fireman's Fund benefit. 
I'll turn the call back to Helen."

And I've said that from the beginning. And that is a healthy thing. The market needs choice, number one. Number two, it isn't about the roughly $10 billion high net worth market, or $8 billion or whatever it is, that exists today. It's about the market that we imagine is in the $30 billion or $40 billion range, those who require or really need a richer product that is rich in service, rich in coverage, rich in benefits and more about service and benefits than it is about price. And those individuals who have a lifestyle and assets to protect are insured in more standard lines companies right now. And the long-term play is to attract them and serve them in the high net worth market. So that's the real play. What I'd say about competition is pretty simple. To step up to the standards and the level that Chubb represents, which is the gold standard of the business, requires years of investment and attention. You don't build something like this overnight. The capabilities you have to bring in terms of service capabilities, both risk and engineering services to individual customers, and the claims service capabilities and the richness of the coverages and the ability to service them all over the globe, well, I'll tell you what, that's not an easy lift. And you win these customers one by one, and the average premiums can vary anywhere from $5,000 to a couple of hundred thousand dollars. It's hard work. So to anybody entering the space, it is a good business. And if you do it right, it takes a lot of patience, a lot of capital and good luck. And by the way, we'll put the welcome mat out for you."

Though middle market new business was down about 4%, large account was down in around 30%. January was a much tougher month in terms of new business, then February and March was better, and April was better than March as we go forward. So we know a combination of things as we look at it. Definitely, there was -- it was a more competitive environment in January. And January is always a competitive month relative to other months. As a matter of fact, I have to tell you, in the softer part of the cycle, you're better off to try to write new business in the off months of a quarter. January is tough. April can be tough, March, April. And June, July is like January, the way people go after it. And they have some growth objectives that they want to achieve. So there was some impact from that, and we see that. But in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of people we focused for 6 months very intensely on planning the merger. And there were sort of 11th-hour jitters of people as we come up to close, and everybody is focused on to a degree of the integration and the structure and who am I working for and what is my job. And then the integration itself, all the planning of that just takes time, and it's some time away from working on new business. And January, and to a degree, February, is impacted by your activities in the fourth quarter, which is November, December. And then we closed the middle of January, so everybody then has to execute. And there is just a mountain of execution when you take it by function, by area of business, by geography all over the world. And I'm very proud about how we've executed because people have done it. It's been in a -- there haven't been a lot of surprises. Everybody's known what to do, and it's gone very smoothly. And we've been -- and then people have been -- spent a lot of time getting to know each other and getting to know what the capabilities were and learning the products of each other before you can take it out to market. And we could really begin to feel that start to take hold in February, move into March, and as it moves in April, it just keeps on building. So maybe that gives you a little sense."

So broad based. In Mexico, it's automobile and small commercial related, but automobile in particular.  In Malaysia, it's auto and, again, specialty and small commercial related. We write cell phone insurance out in Asia, and that had nice growth. In Europe, we write cell phone-related insurance, and that had really nice growth. So it isn't from one place nor one geography. And it isn't traditional versus specialty. It's broad based. But it's very -- when I say broad based, we're very targeted and focused about where we choose to do Personal Lines and how we choose to do it. It's easy to put on a lot of revenue in that business. It's not easy to do it and make a decent margin."

Don't try to corner it. On the other hand -- look, we represent -- and that's what I tried to say in my commentaries, we represent a very attractive market and alternative for large accounts seeking a deep balance sheet, great underwriting expertise, as you know, great reputation for service, global capability, broad product offering and services. There are -- and by the way, which has become more and more the play in large account business, your technology, your ability to deliver in a way that the service standards are met, the service expectations are met. And those standards of service have only risen. The expectations have only risen over the last decade, in the last 5 years and 3 years. People expect great data, great information in a very rapid way, self-served way, where they can serve themselves. We have that technology. Very few have that. Our ability to move money, our ability to service self-insureds, our ability to risk engineer, our ability to provide primary casualty coverages, including professional lines, all over the world and service claims, very few can do that. And we have been stable in terms of our capacity offering and our approach to underwriting and our pricing. Sometimes, the market moves closer to us when the market is more disciplined in terms of underwriting. Sometimes, the market moves further away from us because others are willing to sell something at a price we consider too cheap or at terms we consider too broad. So on one hand, we're in a market where it's competitive, and some things are being sold at prices that are below costs we think are reasonable.  On the other hand, there is this pull and desire for stability and certainty and familiarity, and that is drawing more towards us. So I can tell you we just came back from RIMS, all of us there. I have not seen a reception towards our company in -- towards this company, I don't think I've ever seen the reception like I saw at RIMS. We are really popular kids on campus."

On the domestic and margin, there's been questions to us of, well, now that you're so dominant in that business, we assume you're going to now, in a sense, be predatory, take advantage, raise prices, et cetera, increase margins. I think there's a naïveté about all of that, and I think that's wrong. Our approach is to earn an adequate risk-adjusted return in the business. The business does that reasonably well today. There is a lot of risk in the business. The business is regulated. You have to file your rates, and they have to be just -- they have to be actuarially justified, and we do that. And that adds a complexity but adds a stability as well. Secondly, we want to win customers by offering a great service at a fair price, and hardly do we want to try to push it where we make our money simply on -- try to make more money on the cohort we have rather than grow the cohort if we're making an adequate risk adjustment. So with all of that, what I'd say to you is we see stability as we look forward in the margins in the business. And we don't consider that we're making excessive returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, we are not. We're making reasonable returns."

So I can't -- if you're looking for a point estimate, a numeric estimate of what was specifically integration related versus market related, I can't give you that. Nobody knows that. But I can tell you that the market -- market discipline, for those who are disciplined in underwriting, absolutely is having an impact on growth rate, and you could see that as you look at players who've reported. And that definitely has an impact on us. And there were times -- and I've said this. I've been very clear that there are times that revenue is for vanity, and revenue growth is for vanity, and it's best you take your eye off of that. And there are pockets of the business, many pockets of the business where I and my colleagues think that it's not an overly attractive market, and you better discriminate very carefully on what you choose to write and how you choose to write it and if you want to maintain underwriting margins. And that's our first objective. So I will shed revenue without a tear in any class, in any line of business where we can't make an underwriting profit. Period. And you know that about us. The retention rates were very high. And that, to me, shows me the market reaction towards us and the demand for business from Chubb, from doing business with Chubb, by both distribution and customers, and the good work of our people. When I look at the pattern of new business and how it came in and where it came in and the timing of it, it's very clear to me that the integration -- and in discussions with our people, that the integration had an impact. And when I look at how we're moving month to month, I can see that beginning to recede and people really getting on without getting out there and driving for it. So I see a combination of both impacting it. I can't do anything about the market, and that will be what it will be. But I can tell you getting the organization focused, that is something we can do something about, and we're all focused on that. Everyone is out there. We've been to many regions, to many offices, working with our people and helping them to get on the front foot. And I feel really good about the energy level and the focus of the organization that is taking hold.

First, you didn't define growth the way I define growth and the way, therefore, we define growth -- a growth company for us.

First, you didn't define growth the way I define growth and the way, therefore, we define growth -- a growth company for us. A growth company in this business is growth in book value and tangible book value. That's how you define growth in a risk business, not revenue growth, which is an overly simplistic way. Ultimately, you have to gain revenue growth as well. So I reject that notion of what's a growth company. Number two, we will -- we don't give guidance, and so I'm not going to start giving guidance about revenue growth, but I will say this to you. I firmly believe that whatever the growth rate was projected, and at ACE, we do long-term -- at ACE, we did long-term 5-year plans. We would roll forward every year. And we had a projection of what we thought our growth rates would be over a coming 5-year period. I have a sense of what Chubb -- legacy Chubb would have thought of its growth potential over a 2- to 3-year period and what they would have seen. I do firmly believe that when you sum those 2 together, the 2 together will have greater growth than the 2 would -- the sum of the 2 separately would. There is little doubt of that in my mind. How significant? We have ranges internally from what we think might be conservative to what we think might be more aggressive. But when I pitch it up the middle, I think it will be meaningful. And I did say that I thought that by the fifth year, it would come into the billions of dollars range and multiples of billions, and I believe that, from what it otherwise would be. And while that's not a -- what you wanted as an answer from me specifically, I hope that gives you some insight."

What I love is the balance of business in this company. By geography, when I look at opportunities through Asia, when I look at opportunities in Latin America, when I look at opportunities through the United States and I just look geographically, I see -- and in Europe, I see so much room to move, where there are some territories and some lines of business that, to maintain margin, you need to shrink. I see other areas where we have the capabilities, we have the presence and it's about execution to grow in those areas. And when you have the data we have and the knowledge we have, putting that to work, it is a job of execution at that point. When I look at our spread of business by type of business, by customer, from large segment where it's obviously, except for the dislocation of others that put some wind at your back, it's obviously the more difficult area to grow, and in fact, you're going to go sideways or shrink it in many areas of that business if you're going to maintain underwriting discipline. But I then look on the other side of the coin at the middle market and the capabilities we have in that area and our reputation and our relationships and our ability to drive more product and grow that more quickly, that just gives me a lot of optimism. I look at our A&H business around the world. I look at our Personal Lines business, both in the United States and outside the U.S., and potential in that area. I add it all up, and there are areas where you apply the gas, and there are areas where you apply the brake. And we know how to do that quite well. And as I said, I will never get baited into revenue growth to maintain margins. And when my guys are feeling a little bad because they have to shed business to maintain margin, I got to tell you what, I suck it up and I cheerlead it because it's the right thing to do."

You then have some investments you make in new businesses, so small commercial, as an example. Or maybe you're expanding your cyber business or other businesses, and those will take investments. And then on the other side of the coin where -- we talk about legacy Chubb as being starved in some ways, and I think that's right. On one hand, it's technology, and so you invest in technology. But there, you have a cash spend, but you then capitalize and amortize over many years, so that impact will not be as you would imagine, sort of $1 of expense and $1 drops to the bottom. But you got a cash flow, and then you have an amortization of it. So those are what draws away from expense save and from the direct -- coming directly all to the bottom."

There are some differences. I'd put those at the margin. Clearly, our process in terms of timing and frequency of studies would be different.

After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or 225 pe",1787,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter. Though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globals. 25 of them by account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or 225 per share compared to 240 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was 91 per share, up 7% over prior year; and for the 6 months, up 11%, demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results, which are in line with our expectations, and I think the accretive nature of our merger. As I did last quarter, discussing our underwriting results in premium growth give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items in '16 and underwriting to the '15-year prior quarter as if we were 1 company back then simply as if. As you know, as a Manager, this is how I look to our results. So to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was published 91.2. And then as if which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%. A really good result that included $311 million and an after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million what we had contemplated on a pretax basis. They are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past, appear in line with longer-term historical results. The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was $88.9 in the quarter versus $88  as if we were 1 company last year. Last year has the onetime benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction, excluding that, our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident-year results. Again, on basis, prior positive prior reserve development of $301 million pretax was a down $35 million versus prior year. Chubb net investment income for the quarter was $816 million good resulted given continued impact of foreign exchange and lower interest rates, but very Modestly below our expectations in guidance Progress repositioning our portfolio, which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter is on track. Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at over 101 56. For the year, per-share book value was up over 13%. Our annualized operating ROE at 10% year-to-date. We have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development in cat's. Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed onetime benefit for the portfolio transfer of fireman's fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat, international retail P&C was up 1.5%, international wholesale P&C was down 7% and global was down 13%. Net premiums written from North American Personal Lines were down about 27% or 5%, excluding the onetime Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, just imagining legacy Chubb Personal Lines, normalized premiums were in fact up. Given softer market conditions and the underwriting actions, we took, due to the consolidation of our 2 companies, that consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our recent calls, we were planning a merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards for risk appetite that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business will improve our risk reward profile and will continue this year and into '17. In addition, we're choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. All together, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points. On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show and this contributor developed 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth. I'm going to give you some more detail on of our revenue results and pricing by major division beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2% with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall, renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the corner -- quarter, general and specialty casualty related pricing was down 0.9%, with Worker's Comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%. Terms and conditions are generally holding, but we're noticing some erosion around the margins business ratings for middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call Major Accounts in specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1 and Westchester E&S up 0.5%. For our retail Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing. However, for both primary and excess capabilities make a real difference and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that. Pricing conditions is less competitive than straight accessed layers are simply about capacity. Terms and conditions are generally holding in Major Accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we was down 2.5%. General, and specialty casualty related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account and properly -- property-related pricing was down 10%. New business writings on the gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead access, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way, has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is combination of quality and few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures. In of our North America Personal Lines business, normalized premiums were up about a point for the combined ACE Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall, rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. The legacy fireman's fund portfolio retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and nonrenewal actions, as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper and some producers and customers chose instead to more more it cheaper, and in our judgment, under priced option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer. Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance insurance protection for our North America Personal Lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk reward profile. Net premiums for agricultural business were down just over 1% in the quarter due to commodity prices, offset by growth and exposure. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. As I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter 1.5% on constant dollars, while in our London market based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7%, due entirely to market conditions. Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product. Asia Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to Commercial P&C market conditions and Personal Lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat with the Continental up 4% and the U.K. down 4%? From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while Personal Lines grew 2%. It's worth noting, we have chosen to to the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year; excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%. Overall, renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote for our international commercial P&C business was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact, slower rate of decline relative to the '15 year. Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarter. And our globally business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see the tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We are very focused delivered efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each others products and services and promotional campaigns. Some areas where we've seen a leak cross-selling success include environmental, health care, professional lines, Worker's Comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success. Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We're meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectation, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization has not during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cat and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policy holders. Our people are continuing to themselves together and 1 unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending fatherless time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions."

Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash in invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable. And A+ plus rating with a stable outlook and we under reviewed designation. Adjusted investment income of $860 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned, and as we discussed last quarter, we are on track to reposition the portfolio to enhance returns without taking significant additional risk. However, based on the decline in invested during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter, which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility, investment yields, prepayments on our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately 4 years. Our current book yield is 39.4% and new money are 2.3%. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pretax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the declined interest rates, a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up a 6.1%, reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains, I just mentioned. Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter ration was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 89%. As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance was $390 million pretax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pretax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details from where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior-period reserve development was positive $301 million pretax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines,  principally from from 2011 and prior and $96 million from short-tail lines. Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is a 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates based on where our income emerges. I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

Because I said the Fireman's Fund 72% retention rate, that would have impacted that 5%, and excluding it, we were up 1%, I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things. Nonrenewal action, we actually non renewed a certain percentage of the portfolio; and pricing action, we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb pricing/ACE when we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert to ACE Chubb paper on pricing. There is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of ACE's. And that also impacted the renewal retention rates. There are customers and producers and chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, while it will continue, it's on a far-diminished basis and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rates because it's on business that's on legacy ACE"

I gave you the color that we are down around 1.5%. We had an impact of about 1.5%, negative growth to the actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger and that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either nonrenewable or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line. Additionally, we did because the market is soft. We did also take some underwriting actions, little bit about what we might have and related around the reinsurance as well, where we justed the risk rewards. So all together, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes some -- it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I got to tell you, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%, that high. That's a very good renewal retention rate, which, in the middle market commercial business in The United States today, the pattern is everyone is -- was responsible, trying to hold onto their revenue was and there is less drive for new business. Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting. There is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy thinks too, and I think, fairly desperate things to show growth in new business. That normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. And in our large account business, we ran over 90 retention rate, excellent. So what do you have? A higher retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting actions that we have taken to improve risk reward that we contemplated and some actions that we took that impact of net premium, but improve our risk reward based on soft market conditions, feeling pretty good to me."

When I look at the industry losses, even thought they are more elevated, but historic, but when I look at our share of them and relative to our share of business, et cetera, they didn't throw me at all. It made good sense to me, #1. Number two, you saw the global actually had a part of cat losses in the quarter. And they've been relatively quiet. They sell cat excess we have for many, many years. So you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way. Your reinsurance portfolio and they've done very well, by the way, and that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million, $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have ""expected,"" but it's cat access. So what do you know? If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE, by itself, would have been 5 points of earned premium in the quarter, would have been an expected the 2 companies together now at about 5 and 3 quarter points of earned premium, so the volatility in signature hasn't really changed.

In the U.S., a fraction of our portfolio was automobile. Most of it is homeowners, jewelry, art, furnishings, it's a much broader portfolio. Auto is a minority portion of it. You get to Brazil, there is no high value homeowners per se. And ensuring all the rest, very tiny markets, so it's the reverse. We end up with the automobile portfolio that is very, in a sense anti-selected and hard to to and you don't get paid for and you don't have the benefits of all the rest.

203028,334089634,1014209,"Chubb Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $",1823,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $2.25 per share compared to $2.40 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was $2.91 per share, up 7% over prior year; and for 6 months, up 11%, demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results, which are in line with our expectations and I think depict the accretive nature of our merger. 
As I did last quarter, discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items in '16 that distort underwriting, to the '15 year prior quarter as if we were one company back then or put simply as if. As you know, as a Manager, this is how I look at our results. So to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was published 91.2%, and then as if, which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%, a really good result that included $311 million after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million or above what we had contemplated on a pretax basis. They are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past appear in line with longer-term historical results. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was $88.9 in the quarter versus $88 as if we were one company last year. Last year has the onetime benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction, excluding that, our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident year results. Again, on an as if basis, prior positive prior-period reserve development of $301 million pretax was down $35 million versus prior year. 
Chubb net investment income for the full quarter was $816 million, a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and lower interest rates and very modestly below our expectations in guidance this year. Progress repositioning our portfolio, which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter, is on track. 
Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at $101.56. For the year, per share book value was up over 13%. Our annualized operating ROE is circa 10% year-to-date. We'll have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development in cats. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant-dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed onetime benefit from the portfolio transfer of Fireman's Fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat, international retail P&C was up 1.5%, international wholesale P&C was down 7% and Global Re was down 13%. Net premiums written for North America Personal Lines were down about 27% or 5% excluding the onetime Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, so just imagining legacy ACE and Chubb Personal Lines, normalized premiums were in fact up. Given softer market conditions and the underwriting actions we took due to the consolidation of our 2 companies, but consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our recent calls, we were planning a merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards for risk appetite that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business will improve our risk reward profile and will continue this year and into '17. 
In addition, we're choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. All together, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points. 
On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show and this contributor developed 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth. 
I'm going to give you some more detail on our revenue results and pricing by major division beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2% with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall, renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the corner -- quarter, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 0.9%, with Worker's Comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%. Terms and conditions are generally holding, though we are noticing some erosion around the margins. New business ratings for our middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. 
In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1% and Westchester E&S up 0.5%. For our retail Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing. However, for lead players, both primary and excess, where capabilities make a real difference, and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that. Pricing conditions is less competitive than straight excess layers where it's simply about capacity. Terms and conditions are generally holding in the Major Accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 2.5%. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account D&O and properly -- property-related pricing was down 10%. 
New business writings on a gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead excess, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way, has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is a combination of flight quality and a few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures. 
In our North America Personal Lines business, normalized premiums were up above a point for the combined ACE and Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall, rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. The legacy fireman's fund portfolio, retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and nonrenewal actions, as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper, and some producers and customers chose instead to move to a cheaper, and in our judgment, underpriced option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer. 
Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance protection for our North America Personal Lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk-reward profile. Net premiums for our agricultural business were down just over 1% in the quarter, due to commodity prices offset by growth and exposure. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. As I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter 1.5% in constant dollars. While in our London market-based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7% due entirely to market conditions. 
Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to Commercial P&C market conditions and Personal Lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat with the Continental up 4% and the U.K. down 4%. 
From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while Personal Lines grew 2%. It's worth noting, we have chosen to exit the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year. Excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%. Overall, renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote for our international commercial P&C business, was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact, slower rate of decline relative to the '15 year. 
Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarter. And our Global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. 
As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see the tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We are very focused delivered efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each other's products and services and promotional campaigns. Some areas where we've seen early cross-selling success include environmental, health care, professional lines, Worker's Comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success. 
Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We're meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectation, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization has not missed a beat during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cat and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policyholders. Our people are continuing to mitt themselves together and coalesce into 1 unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending far less time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. 
With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions."

Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash in invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable. And A.M. Best reaffirmed our A++ plus rating with a stable outlook and removed their under review designation. Adjusted investment income of $816 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation, because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned, and as we discussed last quarter, we are on track to reposition the portfolio to enhance returns without taking significant additional risk. However, based on the decline in investment yields during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter, which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility, investment yields, prepayments on our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately 4 years. Our current book yield is 3.4%, and new money rates are 2.3%. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pretax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up 6.1%, reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned.  
Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 89%. 
As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance were $390 million pretax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pretax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details from where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior-period reserve development was positive $301 million pretax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2011 and prior and $96 million from short-tail lines. Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates vary based on where our income emerges. 
I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

Because I said the Fireman's Fund ran a 72% retention rate, that's what impacted that 5%, and excluding it, we were up 1%, and I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things: nonrenewal action, we actually nonrenewed a certain percentage of the portfolio; and pricing action we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb/ACE pricing when you -- we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert it to ACE or Chubb paper on pricing, there is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of cases. And that also impacted renewal retention rates. There are customers and producers who chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, while it will continue, it's on a far-diminished basis, and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rates, because it's on business that's on legacy ACE paper."

And Evan mentioned, where we're seeing in terms of the products, maybe I'll give you one which, I think, kind of speaks to the strength of the 2 companies coming together in a piece of business we wrote this quarter that was worth of a couple of million dollars of premium. And it was a relationship that legacy Chubb had, a very stronger relationship going back for a number through their D&O position as lead D&O carrier and also an excess liability. The client is in the nursing home business, a large nursing home chain. Legacy Chubb had chosen to stay out of medical liability business over the years. Legacy ACE, we've been in that business for a long time, know it well, have done well in it. Knowing the client well, knowing the producer well, we went and had a conversation about their coverage for medical liability. Given the relationship they enjoyed with legacy Chubb, they were more than happy to talk to us about that, and that resulted in us writing a medical liability for a couple of million dollars of premium. And I think, we probably would not have written both for the 2 companies coming together."

We have an example -- one example is we have a large risk management business out of a satellite office that came from an agent that wasn't even appointed on the ACE producer list. And this agent had a house account that was introduced to the ACE risk management team and our ACE's claim team. We took a small single specialty line that Chubb had written on financial lines and turned that into a $6.5 million relationship by being able to the write the comp, geo, auto and claims all in a cash flow basis.

I gave you the color that we're down around 1.5%. We had an impact of about 1.5% negative growth due to actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger, and that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either nonrenewable or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line. 
Additionally, we did -- because the market is soft, we did also take some underwriting actions a little bit about what we might have and related around the reinsurance as well, where we judged the risk rewards. So all together, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes some -- it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I've got to tell you, though, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%. That's high. That's a very good renewal retention rate, which, in the middle market commercial business in The United States today, the pattern is, everyone's trying -- who is responsible is trying to hold onto their revenue was and there is less drive for new business. Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting, there is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy things to -- and I think fairly desperate things to show growth and write new business. That's just normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. 
And in our large account business, we ran over 90% retention rate. Excellent. So what do you have? A higher retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting actions that we have taken to improve risk reward that we contemplated, and some actions that we took that impact net premium but improved our risk reward based on soft market conditions. Feeling pretty good to me."

We have a responsibility in that leadership. And we have been absent from the stage of late. We, as a country, recognize the price we seem to pay for that leadership, but we hardly recognize the benefits that are enormous that we gain as a country because the world is hardwired since World War II to advantage The United States. And the benefits to our economy and GDP and the benefits in terms of stability where economies don't flourish but with stability and predictability. And so it's worrisome. And the growing protectionism is worrisome. And the only way you move past that is with leadership and its political leadership. Central banks can't help you with this. And protectionism, we all get what that does. At the end of the day, it's beggar thy neighbor, and the pie grows smaller. The pie doesn't grow bigger. And if you want to feed those who are disadvantaged and you want to provide them opportunities and you want a more prosperous world, you need to be able to afford it. And the only way is through growth. And growth in trade and growth in global trade, where each can bring and use its competitive advantage, that has served the world well. And that -- and the way we're vilifying it and somehow retrading on the past and characterizing it that trade has been evil and has damaged our country and has damaged the world, it's just so misguided. And then to add to that, the immigration is somehow our enemy. It's again misguided populism and feeding on the suffering of those who may vote. So you get where I stand, clearly."

When I look at the industry losses, even though they are more elevated but historic, and I look at our share of them, and relative to our share business, et cetera, they didn't throw me at all. It made good sense to me, number one. Number two, you saw the global REIT actually had a part of CAT losses in the quarter. And they've been relatively quiet. They sell CAT excess. We have for many, many years. And so you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way, your reinsurance portfolio, and they've done very well, by the way and -- that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million, $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have ""expected,"" but it's CAT excess. So what do you know? 
If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE, by itself, would have been about 5 points of earned premium in the quarter would have been an expected. The 2 companies together now, about 5.75 points of earned premium. So the volatility signature hasn't really changed. So anyway, maybe that gives you a little color around it."

203028,334089634,1014479,"Chubb Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $",1825,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $2.25 per share compared to $2.40 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was $2.91 per share, up 7% over prior year; and for 6 months, up 11%, demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results, which are in line with our expectations and I think depict the accretive nature of our merger. 
As I did last quarter, discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items in '16 that distort underwriting, to the '15 year prior quarter as if we were one company back then or put simply as if. As you know, as a Manager, this is how I look at our results. So to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was published 91.2%, and then as if, which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%, a really good result that included $311 million after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million above what we had contemplated on a pretax basis. They are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past appear in line with longer-term historical results. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was $88.9 in the quarter versus $88 as if we were one company last year. Last year has the onetime benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction, excluding that, our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident year results. Again, on an as if basis, prior positive prior-period reserve development of $301 million pretax was down $35 million versus prior year. 
Chubb net investment income for the full quarter was $816 million, a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates and very modestly below our expectations in guidance this year. Progress repositioning our portfolio, which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter, is on track. 
Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at $101.56. For the year, per share book value was up over 13%. Our annualized operating ROE is circa 10% year-to-date. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development in cats. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant-dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed onetime benefit from the portfolio transfer of Fireman's Fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat, international retail P&C was up 1.5%, international wholesale P&C was down 7% and Global Re was down 13%. Net premiums written for North America Personal Lines were down about 20% or 5% excluding the onetime Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, so just imagining legacy ACE and Chubb Personal Lines, normalized premiums were in fact up. Given softer market conditions and the underwriting actions we took due to the consolidation of our 2 companies, but consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our recent calls, when we were planning a merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards for risk appetite that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business will improve our risk reward profile and will continue this year and into '17. 
In addition, we're choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. All together, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points. 
On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show and this contributed about 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth. 
I'm going to give you some more detail on our revenue results and pricing by major division beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2% with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall, renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the corner -- quarter, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 0.9%, with Worker's Comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%. Terms and conditions are generally holding, though we are noticing some erosion around the margins. New business ratings for our middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. 
In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1% and Westchester E&S up 0.5%. For our retail Major Account’s business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing. However, for lead layers, both primary and excess, where capabilities make a real difference, and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that. Pricing conditions are less competitive than straight excess layers where it's simply about capacity. Terms and conditions are generally holding in the Major Accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 2.5%. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account D&O and properly -- property-related pricing was down 10%. 
New business writings on a gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead excess, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way, has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is a combination of flight to quality and a few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures. 
In our North America Personal Lines business, normalized premiums were up about 1 point for the combined ACE and Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall, rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. The legacy fireman's fund portfolio, retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and nonrenewal actions, as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper, and some producers and customers chose instead to move to a cheaper, and in our judgment, underpriced option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer. 
Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance protection for our North America Personal Lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk-reward profile. Net premiums for our agricultural business were down just over 1% in the quarter, due to commodity prices offset by growth in exposure. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. As I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter 1.5% in constant dollars. While in our London market-based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7%, due entirely to market conditions. 
Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to Commercial P&C market conditions and Personal Lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat with the Continent up 4% and the U.K. down 4%. 
From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while Personal Lines grew 2%. It's worth noting, we have chosen to exit the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year. Excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%. Overall, renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote for our international commercial P&C business, was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact, slower rate of decline relative to the '15 year. 
Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarter. And our Global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. 
As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see the tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We are very focused delivered efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each other's products and services and promotional campaigns. Some areas where we've seen early cross-selling success include environmental, health care, professional lines, Worker's Comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success. 
Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We're meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectation, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization has not missed a beat during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cat and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policyholders. Our people are continuing to knit themselves together and coalesce into 1 unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending far less time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. 
With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions."

Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash in invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable. And A.M. Best reaffirmed our A++ plus rating with a stable outlook and removed their under review designation. Adjusted investment income of $816 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation, because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned, and as we discussed last quarter, we are on track to reposition the portfolio to enhance returns without taking significant additional risk. However, based on the decline in investment yields during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter, which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility, investment yields, prepayments on our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately 4 years. Our current book yield is 3.4%, and new money rates are 2.3%. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pretax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up 6.1%, reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned.  
Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 89%. 
As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance were $390 million pretax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pretax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details from where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior-period reserve development was positive $301 million pretax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2011 and prior and $96 million from short-tail lines. Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates vary based on where our income emerges. 
I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

Because I said the Fireman's Fund ran a 72% retention rate, that's what impacted that 5%, and excluding it, we were up 1%, and I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things: nonrenewal action, we actually nonrenewed a certain percentage of the portfolio; and pricing action we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb/ACE pricing when you -- we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert it to ACE or Chubb paper on pricing, there is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of cases. And that also impacted renewal retention rates. There are customers and producers who chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, while it will continue, it's on a far-diminished basis, and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rates, because it's on business that's on legacy ACE paper."

And it was a relationship that legacy Chubb had, a very strong relationship going back for a number of years through their D&O position as lead D&O carrier and also an excess liability. The client is in the nursing home business, a large nursing home chain. Legacy Chubb had chosen to stay out of medical liability business over the years. Legacy ACE, we've been in that business for a long time, know it well, have done well in it. Knowing the client well, knowing the producer well, we went and had a conversation about their coverage for medical liability. Given the relationship they enjoyed with legacy Chubb, they were more than happy to talk to us about that, and that resulted in us writing a medical liability for a couple of million dollars of premium.

I gave you the color that we're down around 1.5%. We had an impact of about 1.5% negative growth due to actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger, and that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either nonrenewable or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line. 
Additionally, we did -- because the market is soft, we did also take some underwriting actions a little bit above what we might have and related around the reinsurance as well, where we judged the risk rewards. So all together, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes some -- it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I've got to tell you, though, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%. That's high. That's a very good renewal retention rate, which, in the middle market commercial business in The United States today, the pattern is, everyone's trying -- who is responsible is trying to hold onto their renewals and there is less drive for new business. Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting, there is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy things to -- and I think fairly desperate things to show growth and write new business. That's just normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. 
And in our large account business, we ran over 90% retention rate. Excellent. So what do you have? A higher retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting actions that we have taken to improve risk reward that we contemplated, and some actions that we took that impact net premium but improved our risk reward based on soft market conditions. Feeling pretty good to me."

The person in charge of medical liability is now in charge of our whole medical practice group. And we know that there has been legacy Chubb, had a large appetite on the property side for that business, and had a great practice. And so those people become part of a common unit, and they -- and it begins. They begin that unit at underwriting, at the underwriting side. And they put together lists of common risks where they would -- where everyone would play. And then that moves down to our underwriters in the regions who understand that, and they're caused to come together in that practice group. And then they're moving into their branches where we have salespeople and agent relationship people who get educated. And the underwriters go out with them. And they visit producers that have that business in those portfolios of it. And so you -- and then management feedback because if you can't count it, it ain't worth doing. And so you've got targets and objectives, both financial and nonfinancial. Of -- in the beginning, it's nonfinancial because it's activity-related. It's related around internal activities of how people are organized and how they're educating each other and how they're doing discovery. And then that turns into an offering. And then you start moving that into submissions. And then those submissions move in to quotes. And those quotes move in to bound business, and you are measuring that. Now you have entered our life."

Is this a brilliant time to enter the trade credit or political risk business? Interest rates at record lows. $11 trillion in negative rates. Invested in negative spreads. You have real rates. You have a world awash in capital, tremendous amount of misallocation of capital, and with all that, you have a world growing below trend economically and slowing down more, protectionism growing, and geopolitical risk everywhere. It sounds like a brilliant time to get into that business, by the way, where rates are at a not a record low, but certainly at a low point.

And the growing protectionism is worrisome. And the only way you move past that is with leadership and its political leadership. Central banks can't help you with this. And protectionism, we all get what that does. At the end of the day, it's beggar thy neighbor, and the pie grows smaller. The pie doesn't grow bigger.

And that -- and the way we're vilifying it and somehow retrading on the past and characterizing it that trade has been evil and has damaged our country and has damaged the world, it's just so misguided.

It made good sense to me, number one. Number two, you saw the global REIT actually had a part of CAT losses in the quarter. And they've been relatively quiet. They sell CAT excess. We have for many, many years. And so you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way, your reinsurance portfolio, and they've done very well, by the way and -- that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million, $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have ""expected,"" but it's CAT excess. So what do you know? 
If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE, by itself, would have been about 5 points of earned premium in the quarter would have been an expected.

On the other side of the coin, the federal courts, and particularly, the Supreme Court, has been pretty friendly to -- in its rulings, more favorable for corporate. And when you look at class actions and security class actions-related rulings, those have been favorable. Look, you look forward, and if -- depending on who is elected, we could see a more liberal terms in the courts. And that would, be -- I think that would ultimately be hostile to tort and for insurance."

And that's a -- just a parlor statistic figure.

In the U.S., a fraction of our portfolio was automobile. Most of it is homeowners, jewelry, art, furnishings. It's a much broader portfolio. Auto is the -- is a minority portion of it. You get to Brazil, there is no high-value homeowners per se. And insuring all the rest, very tiny market. So it's the reverse. We end up with an automobile portfolio that is very, in a sense, anti-selected and hard to manage and which you don't get paid for, and you don't have the benefits of all the rest.

203028,334089634,1014887,"Chubb Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $",1825,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a pretty good quarter, though we're impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $2.25 per share compared to $2.40 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was $2.91 per share, up 7% over prior year; and for 6 months, up 11%, demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results, which are in line with our expectations and I think depict the accretive nature of our merger. 
As I did last quarter, discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and onetime merger-related items in '16 that distort underwriting, to the '15 year prior quarter as if we were one company back then or put simply as if. As you know, as a Manager, this is how I look at our results. So to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was published 91.2%, and then as if, which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%, a really good result that included $311 million after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million above what we had contemplated on a pretax basis. They are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past appear in line with longer-term historical results. 
The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was $88.9 in the quarter versus $88 as if we were one company last year. Last year has the onetime benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction, excluding that, our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident year results. Again, on an as if basis, prior positive prior-period reserve development of $301 million pretax was down $35 million versus prior year. 
Chubb net investment income for the full quarter was $816 million, a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates and very modestly below our expectations in guidance this year. Progress repositioning our portfolio, which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter, is on track. 
Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at $101.56. For the year, per share book value was up over 13%. Our annualized operating ROE is circa 10% year-to-date. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value as well as prior-period reserve development in cats. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant-dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed onetime benefit from the portfolio transfer of Fireman's Fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat, international retail P&C was up 1.5%, international wholesale P&C was down 7% and Global Re was down 13%. Net premiums written for North America Personal Lines were down about 20% or 5% excluding the onetime Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, so just imagining legacy ACE and Chubb Personal Lines, normalized premiums were in fact up. Given softer market conditions and the underwriting actions we took due to the consolidation of our 2 companies, but consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our recent calls, when we were planning a merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards for risk appetite that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business will improve our risk reward profile and will continue this year and into '17. 
In addition, we're choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. All together, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points. 
On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show and this contributed about 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth. 
I'm going to give you some more detail on our revenue results and pricing by major division beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2% with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall, renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the corner -- quarter, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 0.9%, with Worker's Comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%. Terms and conditions are generally holding, though we are noticing some erosion around the margins. New business ratings for our middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. 
In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1% and Westchester E&S up 0.5%. For our retail Major Account’s business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing. However, for lead layers, both primary and excess, where capabilities make a real difference, and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that. Pricing conditions are less competitive than straight excess layers where it's simply about capacity. Terms and conditions are generally holding in the Major Accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 2.5%. 
General and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account D&O and properly -- property-related pricing was down 10%. 
New business writings on a gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead excess, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way, has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is a combination of flight to quality and a few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures. 
In our North America Personal Lines business, normalized premiums were up about 1 point for the combined ACE and Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall, rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. The legacy fireman's fund portfolio, retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and nonrenewal actions, as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper, and some producers and customers chose instead to move to a cheaper, and in our judgment, underpriced option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer. 
Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance protection for our North America Personal Lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk-reward profile. Net premiums for our agricultural business were down just over 1% in the quarter, due to commodity prices offset by growth in exposure. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. As I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter 1.5% in constant dollars. While in our London market-based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7%, due entirely to market conditions. 
Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product. Asia-Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to Commercial P&C market conditions and Personal Lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat with the Continent up 4% and the U.K. down 4%. 
From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while Personal Lines grew 2%. It's worth noting, we have chosen to exit the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year. Excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%. Overall, renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote for our international commercial P&C business, was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact, slower rate of decline relative to the '15 year. 
Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarter. And our Global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. 
As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see the tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We are very focused delivered efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each other's products and services and promotional campaigns. Some areas where we've seen early cross-selling success include environmental, health care, professional lines, Worker's Comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success. 
Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We're meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectation, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization has not missed a beat during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cat and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policyholders. Our people are continuing to knit themselves together and coalesce into 1 unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending far less time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. 
With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions."

Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash in invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable. And A.M. Best reaffirmed our A++ plus rating with a stable outlook and removed their under review designation. Adjusted investment income of $816 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation, because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned, and as we discussed last quarter, we are on track to reposition the portfolio to enhance returns without taking significant additional risk. However, based on the decline in investment yields during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter, which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility, investment yields, prepayments on our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately 4 years. Our current book yield is 3.4%, and new money rates are 2.3%. 
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pretax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up 6.1%, reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned.
Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 89%. 
As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance were $390 million pretax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pretax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details from where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior-period reserve development was positive $301 million pretax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2011 and prior and $96 million from short-tail lines. Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates vary based on where our income emerges.

Because I said the Fireman's Fund ran a 72% retention rate, that's what impacted that 5%, and excluding it, we were up 1%, and I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things: nonrenewal action, we actually nonrenewed a certain percentage of the portfolio; and pricing action we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb/ACE pricing when you -- we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert it to ACE or Chubb paper on pricing, there is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of cases. And that also impacted renewal retention rates. There are customers and producers who chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, while it will continue, it's on a far-diminished basis, and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rates, because it's on business that's on legacy ACE paper."

The client is in the nursing home business, a large nursing home chain. Legacy Chubb had chosen to stay out of medical liability business over the years. Legacy ACE, we've been in that business for a long time, know it well, have done well in it. Knowing the client well, knowing the producer well, we went and had a conversation about their coverage for medical liability.

We had an impact of about 1.5% negative growth due to actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger, and that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either nonrenewable or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line. 
Additionally, we did -- because the market is soft, we did also take some underwriting actions a little bit above what we might have and related around the reinsurance as well, where we judged the risk rewards. So all together, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes some -- it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I've got to tell you, though, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%. That's high. That's a very good renewal retention rate, which, in the middle market commercial business in The United States today, the pattern is, everyone's trying -- who is responsible is trying to hold onto their renewals and there is less drive for new business. Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting, there is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy things to -- and I think fairly desperate things to show growth and write new business. That's just normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. 
And in our large account business, we ran over 90% retention rate. Excellent. So what do you have? A higher retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting actions that we have taken to improve risk reward that we contemplated, and some actions that we took that impact net premium but improved our risk reward based on soft market conditions.

For example, cyber or environmental. And we are certainly cross-selling and taking advantage of those new skills. So yes, there's been an absolute increase in the Chubb appetite if you think about legacy Chubb in the middle market space. So accident and health would be another one, where we're cross-selling. If you're talking about terms and conditions, I think Evan said it in his remarks, that we're seeing a slight erosion around the margin, in particular, around CAT. Flood, we're seeing people lower deductibles for the same premiums or increasing the sublimits around quake. We are resisting that as best as we possibly we can. We are not in the business of underpricing exposure. So we're trying to be as disciplined as we possibly can in this marketplace."

It made good sense to me, number one. Number two, you saw the global REIT actually had a part of CAT losses in the quarter. And they've been relatively quiet. They sell CAT excess. We have for many, many years. And so you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way, your reinsurance portfolio, and they've done very well, by the way and -- that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million, $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have ""expected,"" but it's CAT excess. So what do you know? 
If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE, by itself, would have been about 5 points of earned premium in the quarter would have been an expected.

And frankly, we've been pretty successful at growing that business profitably. The emerging markets business is simpler, basically small property-type packages, some liability, et cetera. 
In the U.K. and in continental Europe, with the distribution that legacy Chubb's bringing, we're now expanding some of those capabilities as well. And that's probably what you have seen in maybe some of the press releases that you may have been referring to is the fact that we're rolling out new product and new capability, especially around Specialty Products, small D&O, small environmental, that sort of thing, really to target the smaller enterprises in the U.K. and the continent."

203028,334090170,1061554,"Chubb Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per sha",1803,"Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per share compared to 274 per share prior year. Again, demonstrating in my judgment, the accretive nature of our merger. As I have done in the last 2 quarters, when discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter, as of we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting. Again, this is how as a manager, I look at the company's performance. 
The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was published 86, and excluding purchase accounting, [ph] that compares to an 85 last year as of we were one company back then. There are 3 components to that, losses were up over prior year to $144 million pretax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year. Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pretax, was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current year combined ratio, excluding losses of 88.4 versus 88.9 last year benefiting in particular from our reduced expense ratio. 
Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this is in fact, contributed to the quarter's results. Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer is prepared to make a few comments on portfolio if you like, just ask him. 
Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development, cat. Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one point of that. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions and certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring certain business reduce our premium, but improved our risk-reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and '17 at a reduced level and will dissipate as the year goes along. If we normalized with these underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5% difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 points of that 4.5 point different. 
The business cancellations representing the balance, keep in mind the additional reinsurance outsized impact this quarter, because of the onetime under premium transfer in personal lines. I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. The pricing environment continue to grow more competitive in the quarter. For our Commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. 
As noted in prior quarters, large account business shared and layered is competitive than midsize and wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others, London, Australia, Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but continuing to soften nonetheless. Globally, new businesses harder to come by, it is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. Of late, an increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. The tension of renewals is a high-priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent and I will give you some details shortly. 
Rate moment varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range for example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote, ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% and our U.S. Major Accounts business, to down 3% and our international retail Commercial P&C operations. Globally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing ranged from down a 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing ranged from flat to down 3 and property-related pricing ranged from down 1% to down 5%. Now with all of that is context, let me give you some details on our revenue results.
In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact at the additional reinsurance repurchase and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rates as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. Our new business writings were up about 1.5%. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. Additional reinsurance we repurchase had a 16.5 point impact and the Fireman's Fund had 3-point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Overall, North America Personal Lines rates were up 1.5 and exposure change added about 3. Retentions remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95%, respectively. The legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio as we continued to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter.
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter, while still early what we can see today based on forecast and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. Net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollars, and up about 1.5% normalized for the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market-based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4% or flat when normalized for underwriting actions.
The renewal retention rate for our international Commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages and new business writings were down 2%.
International by line of business Commercial P&C net premiums declined 3, but were flat, excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While Personal Lines grew 3% on the same basis. Our globally A&H business that premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter, and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter. Again, in some, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollars, while market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses both domestic and international, in both traditional core package and specialty products. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and Personal Lines business. And the larger accounts not the middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator and we will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions.
We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to mid-market and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business. We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce use our small commercial business owners packet policy. So called during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents, 1 state, it's now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business. We have proven and deep expertise. Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by Worker's Comp, commercial auto and financial lines products. Technology and data are differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as 4 minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our package plans won't require underwriter intervention with an interventional goal to be 90% plus. We also recently launched the Cyber Risk products, specifically designed for micro businesses by a digital distribution through CoverHound as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for microsized small businesses.
We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owners P&C package, all featuring straight through processing from to issue. A number up Chubb's existing micro insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future, just stay tuned. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company.
Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule, in terms of both the realized and annualized savings, as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of '18 to $800 million, up from $750 million. Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing in an especially high level, as tested recently with a number of cats, including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. But remember outstanding claims service to what this organization is all about. Speaking of Hurricane Matthew, our early days from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be $200 million pretax. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil, and then we will come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have a $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid and we're generating substantial capital and positive cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. Remember that as the close of our merger, the initial delusion to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date delusion has been reduced to 16% and improvement of 13 percentage points in 3 quarters. Of course, it includes 5 points of benefits in an unrealized gains because of lower interest rates. In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top-end of our estimated range, and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to management of our portfolio.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in the investment income, including the level of interest rates, prepayments fees on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private activity distributions and foreign exchange. Our expected quarterly investment income run-rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pretax, and include $307 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads of $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio, primarily from the improvement to equity markets, and $95 million loss from FX.
Our investments are unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. Net loss reserves increased $350 million for the quarter. The paid to incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pretax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% form short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident year's 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse developments for legacy environmental liability exposures, which are now included in our corporate segment. 
As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our review in the four. Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter, net of reinsurance were $144 million pretax or $107 million after-tax, principally from U.S. weather-related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million, $200 million related to Personal Lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines. The $200 million Personal Lines reinsurance premium included a $128 million of onetime, on a reserved transfers, which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only, excluding the onetime transfers, the annual impact of Personal Lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million.
As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of related savings, there is no increase in our and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development, because of the jurisdictions in which development occured. Now, I will turn the call back over to Helen."

In addition, earlier this year, I think it's important we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the of the high-yield bond market, which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain stocks of about 7. The result of all of these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of overall $120 million annually, above what the portfolios run-rate would have been since the time of the acquisition.

And we buy the spring so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where either at meeting, our return expectations, or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done. And we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secured additional reinsurance. We go further because I think there is this question out there is also well risk reward ratio and how do we think about that? How do you as investors judge that? First of all, I don't believe you can judge that, we can judge that. But you can't accept that our results turn out. 
And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that, ask yourself that question. We would, reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. It's a rather a risk management and capital management tool. We are very well established views and guidelines and process is to determine manage our risk tolerances. Our appetite for individual for risk volatility is an example. Our accumulations on how much we would take anyone geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur. We have a very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives to we retain the risk, reinsurance it, and if we are going to reinsurer, what's the best reinsurance structure, and the pricing alternatives. We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think our risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net and I adjust as facts and circumstance of company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly, the question you ask yourself, if you are in the very beginning when you do something on the merger like this is, do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue, or you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis. And for me, it's a no brainer. You just do that. Anyway, thank you for the question. And I answered more than you asked."

Pricing is flat, we are down.

Well, that's almost has mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate that still softening and even if it's flat, it doesn't keep pace with loss cost trends. So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And at that point, when it shows up, does that mean market turns? No, there is a lot of capital and there is a -- there is a hunger for rate of return even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE, which i miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me.

But let me take your A&H. And by the way, on small commercial, when you ask could it be material? I want to repeat to you one thing I have said before. First of all, it's about $90 billion market #2, average premiums though keep in mind couple of thousand dollars. So it takes you got to write a lot of customers to build to cast a real shot. In a number of years, in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business end of it. Okay, that's what I mean, by significant. 
When you talk about A&H, it's into 2 pieces. First, in the combined, we do a worksite marketing and we have great technology and we now have quietly build over $100 million of business that is growing quickly, where we are doing supplemental A&H products, not traditional sort of like the same thing that you see all doing we are competing very well in that business. We have now introduced to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an Employee Benefits division, and so we can come in, where it is 50 to a couple of hundred lives that's a sweet spot for us and with technology and supplemental health products such as accident insurance, tread disease, hospital cash et cetera and that is really initiative that we think has led more number of years kind of grow substantial business. Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our Major Accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global Business Travel, 2 corporations, where they pay for the insurance for employees. We are, that is a really initiative for us and it is part of our cross-selling along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul just give you a better sense of that"

A couple of quick examples, on the upper middle market side, we had a global digital company, where the Chubb organization had a small specialty product, it's client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty into the new ACE product with Chubb relationship, and Chubb team and this organization pulled together to write in an excess of $3 million deal.

Number #2, you identified and the overall as you watch the expense ratio and we can also identify to you in the loss ratio, what percentage change in LAE exist and then on so we are tracking the savings. By the way, we track it in a very buttoned up mathematical way, it comes through finance and accounting, it's got controls around it. It can be audited, both externally and by internal audit and so we don't put up these numbers without real governance and control around at all and that's how we manage to do it anyway. So it's all for real and then we have on the other side is what counterbalance is any investments you have that you make increased expense for normal inflation in expenses.

203028,334090170,1061941,"Chubb Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per sha",1828,"Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per share compared to 274 per share prior year, again demonstrating, in my judgment, the accretive nature of our merger. As I have done in the last 2 quarters, when discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter, as if we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting. Again, this is how, as a manager, I look at the company's performance. 
The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 86, and excluding purchase accounting 85.5, that compares to an 85 last year as if we were one company back then. There are 3 components to that. Catastrophe losses were up over prior year to $144 million pretax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year. Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pretax was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses of 88.4 versus 88.9 last year, benefiting in particular from our reduced expense ratio. 
Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record-low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We have made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this is in fact contributed to the quarter's results. Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer, is prepared to make a few comments on the portfolio, if you like. Just ask him. 
Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development and cat. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one-point impact. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions and certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring certain business, reduced our premium, but improved our risk-reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and '17, though at a reduced level, and will dissipate as the year goes along. If we normalized with these underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5 difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 points of that 4.5 point difference. 
The business cancellations representing the balance, keep in mind the additional reinsurance had an outsized impact this quarter, because of the onetime under-earned premium transfer in personal lines. I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. The pricing environment continued to grow more competitive in the quarter. For our Commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. 
As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. And wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but continuing to soften, nonetheless. Globally, new business is harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. Of late, an increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. The tension of renewals is a high priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent, and I will give you some details shortly. 
Rate movement varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range. For example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% and our U.S. Major Accounts business to down 3% and our international retail Commercial P&C operations. Globally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing ranged from down a 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing ranged from flat to down 3%, and property-related pricing ranged from down 1% to down 5%. Now with all of that is context, let me give you some details on our revenue results.
In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance repurchase and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. And new business writings were up about 1.5%. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. The additional reinsurance we repurchased had a 16.5 point impact, and the Fireman's Fund had a 3-point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Overall, North America Personal Lines rates were up 1.5 and exposure change added about 3. Retention remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95%, respectively. With the legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio, as we continued to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter.
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter, while still early from what we can see today. Based on yield forecast and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. Net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollars, and up about 1.5% when normalized for the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market-based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4% or flat when normalized for underwriting actions.
The renewal retention rate for our international Commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages, and new business writings were down 2%.
International by line of business, Commercial P&C net premiums declined 3, but were flat excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions, while Personal Lines grew 3% on the same basis. Our global A&H business that premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter, and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting-related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter. Again, in sum, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollars, while market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade, given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses, both domestic and international, with both traditional core package and specialty products. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and Personal Lines business. For the large account, not for middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator, and we will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions.
We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to mid-market and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business. We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce our small commercial business owners package policies, so called BOP during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents and 1 state, it's now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business, where we have proven and deep expertise. Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by Worker's Comp, commercial auto and financial lines products. Technology and data are a differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as 4 minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our package plans won't require underwriter intervention, with an interventional goal to be 90% plus. We also recently launched the Cyber Risk products, specifically designed for micro businesses by digital distribution through CoverHound, as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for microsized small businesses.
We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owners' P&C package, all featuring straight through processing from quote to issue. A number of Chubb's existing micro-insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future. Just stay tuned. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company.
Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule, in terms of both the realized and annualized savings, as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of '18 to $800 million, up from $750 million. Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing in an especially high level, as tested recently with a number of cats, including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. But remember, outstanding claims service is what this organization is all about. And speaking of Hurricane Matthew, our early days and from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be circa $200 million pretax. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Phil. And then, we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have a $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial capital and positive cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. You'll remember that at the close of our merger, the initial delusion to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date delusion has been reduced to 16% and improvement of 13 percentage points in 3 quarters. Of course, it includes 5 points of benefit in unrealized gains because of lower interest rates. In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top-end of our estimated range and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to the management of our portfolio.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in the investment income, including the level of interest rates, prepayments fees on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pretax and include $307 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads of $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio, primarily from the improvement to equity markets, and a $95 million loss from FX. Our investments are unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. 
Net loss reserves increased $350 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pretax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% from short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident year's 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse developments for legacy environmental liability exposures, which are now included in our corporate segment. 
As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our Asbestos review in the 4. Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter, net of reinsurance were $144 million pretax or $107 million after-tax, principally from U.S. weather-related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million, $200 million related to Personal Lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines. The $200 million Personal Lines reinsurance premium included a $128 million of onetime unearned premium reserve transfers, which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only. Excluding the onetime transfers, the annual impact of Personal Lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million.
As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of integration-related savings. There is no increase in our and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development because of the jurisdictions in which the development occurred. I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

The new organization really hasn't missed a beat in terms of service to both agents and clients. And I think the agents have been extremely complementary on how focus team is on finding solutions to risk exposures. Just one quick example, we were all recently at the CIAB and we ran into an agent who had a Fortune 500 CEO, who had a Personal Lines risk, and -- but it included both cattle and a horse ranch. And I would tell you that in the past, legacy Chubb would have absolutely struggled to figure out a solution for that. And today, we were able to put that together in a very seamless way, and our new capabilities in that area are unmatched and will normally come crisper and better as we go along. So we're very excited about that. As respect to the piece about some concentration, yes, I would suggest to you that some of the agents have been a little concerned about the concentration. We'd seen that more so, and if anything and how they move some of the Fireman's Fund that we had expected that in the retention and that had shown up. You have to remember that the Fireman's Fund book was a conversion and we anticipated that there would be more price dislocation on the Fireman's Fund.

We've been working with these teams to implement strategic and tactical changes to the taxable, municipal and our international portfolios to improve risk-adjusted returns. In addition, earlier this year, I think it is important we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the B -- BB sector of the high-yield bond market, which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain in stocks of about 7. The result of all of these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of overall $120 million annually, above what the portfolios run rate would have been since the time of acquisition.

And we buy the spring so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where it either was at meeting our return expectations or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done. And we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secure additional reinsurance. We go a step further though, because I think there is this question out there also, well, risk-reward ratio and how do we think about that? And how do you as investors judge that? First of all, I don't believe you can judge that. We can judge that. But you can't accept that how our ultimate results turn out. And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting and reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that? You ask yourself that question. We would -- the reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. But it's rather a risk management and capital management tool. We have very well-established views and guidelines and process to determine and manage our risk tolerances. Our appetite for individual per risk volatility is an example. And our accumulations on how much we would take in any one geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur. We have very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives, do we retain the risk, do we reinsurance it, and if we are going to reinsurer it, what's the best reinsurance structure, and the pricing alternatives? We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think our risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net, and adjust as facts and circumstance to both company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly, the question you ask yourself, if you are in the very beginning when you do something on a merger like this is, do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue? Or do you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business, to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis? And for me, it's a no-brainer. You just do that. And -- anyway, thank you for the question. And I answered more than you asked."

It continues and you see it in certain classes, where it rears to Ted, and then at other classes, it's there. It just is a bit more benign. Pricing is flat. We were down. And it's interesting to me the way I listen to people talk about the market, because they'll say, well, see, though the market is not softening because the rate of decline of prices has ameliorated. Well, that's almost -- that's mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate. Well, that's still softening. And even if it's flat, it doesn't keep pace with lost cost trend. So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And at that point, when it shows up, does that mean a market turns? No, there is a lot of capital and there is a hunger for a rate of return. Even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE, which is miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me. That is attractive to many, where there is trillions of dollars sitting in negative returns right now and just hungry for yield. And if they can get absolute yield of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% on an absolute, forget risk-adjusted basis, they are interested. So you will continue to see more capital coming into the business. So I'm not imagining and I don't run our company. I can tell you, we don't build the strategy based on a market turn. We base it on the market we see."

We are making investments in the area, and  this is only a certain number of months, but they will roll out as we go along. So let me give you a little more color. We, first of all, had reorganized ourselves between all the disciplines, between actuarial, underwriting, marketing and sales, where we can, in a faster and more practical way, react to each region in the United States, with each one behaves a little differently, with the states behave differently in terms of both competitive behavior and what we see from a financial profit/loss perspective of pricing. Number two, we are right now in the middle of making investments and executing on actions around what will ultimately come out in the next -- I can't -- I'm not going to predict the month precisely, but what we're going to start rolling out a digital experience around our high net worth business where customers will be able to interact with us and procure service and actually manage coverage in a more digital way. On foundational technology, there is a need to make large investment to update and be state-of-the-art in our foundational technology around underwriting and claims. Claims, we've already done it, and we will be investing in the underwriting side, and plans have been put to do that. In product, Paul began to tell you one of the initiatives that we're already engaged in and that will emerge, and that is the high net worth. There is a larger segment to that population that has farm and ranch exposure. And you can't -- typically, you can't get it all from one carrier. We have the capability with our farm and ranch capabilities as well as our high net worth capabilities. We're putting them together. We've already been piloting where we'll be able to serve that segment, and that distinguishes us from anybody else one-stop shop. Coverage is around cyber liability, which, on a personal basis and, particularly, for high net worth, is a new exposure. We've rolled out product to address that area before anyone else in the market did. And so we're -- this is not something where you'd throw a switch, and I said from the beginning, it'd take a couple years, but we have a lot underway."

But let me take your A&H. And by the way, on small commercial, when you ask could it be material, I'm going to repeat to you one thing I've said before. First of all, it's about a $90 billion market in the United States. Number two, average premiums, though, keep in mind a couple of thousand dollars. So it takes -- you got to write a lot of customers to build -- to cast a real shot. In a number of years, in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business with a D on the end of it, okay? That's what I mean by significant.  When you talk about A&H, it's in 2 pieces. First, in the combined, we do a work site marketing, and we have great technology, and we now have quietly built over $100 million of business that is growing quickly, where we're doing supplemental A&H products, not traditional health, sort of like the same thing that you'd see Allstate or Aflac are doing. And we are competing very well in that business. We have now introduced it to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an Employee Benefits division, and so we can come in where it is 50 to a couple hundred lives, that's a sweet spot for us, and with technology and enrollers offer supplemental health products such as accident insurance, dread disease, hospital cash, et cetera. And that is a real initiative that we think has legs that over a number of years is kind of grow substantial business. Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our Major Accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global business travel, 2 cooperations, where they pay for the insurance for employees. We are -- that is a real initiative for us, and it is part of our cross-selling, along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul just to give you a better sense of that cross-selling."

And Charles, yes, to Evan's earlier point, we've really focused on our cross-selling into our existing customer base and agency books. And also, we co-strength the organization where we've added resources and distribution. I will remind you that with Chubb, we picked up 48 branch offices that are just terrific assets for us. Some of the things that we're selling is clearly the specialty product that is brought to the table, things like environmental, things like global programs, a broader excess appetite, deeper financial lines, cyber, international, construction, transactional risk. These are all specialty plays that our branch operation is just doing a wonderful job of distributing and getting to our relationships and adding that cross-sell. A couple of quick examples, on the upper middle market side, we had a global digital company where the Chubb organization had a small specialty product. This client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty and to the new ACE product with the Chubb relationship and the Chubb team. And this organization pulled together to write in an excess of a $3 million deal. So there is a number of those examples that I can run you through, but it just brings to life one example where the organization has brought together additional capabilities."

An agent, a friend of mine, told me a story where one of our clients in the personal lines world runs a business in the health care industry, and this prospect of his was very anxious to get a Chubb quote. He explained to them that he didn't think that this risk was within Chubb's appetite, but he also admitted to the client, the prospect, that in fact, now that the legacy Chubb had changed to new Chubb, that the appetite has shifted as well because legacy ACE was bringing on something more capabilities and skills. So he approached us. And he was shocked that within days, we put together a very competitive program. The underwriter that he knew helped guide his colleague through the relationship. And we wrote the account with several hundred thousand dollars. That in itself is personally very satisfying for me. But also it's very satisfying that this agent has really turned on to Chubb right now, and their submission activity has increased nicely."

I told you that, really, you can't be Pollyanna-ish about it, that in the beginning, we would take some actions that would have dissynergies, hate the word, give me a better word, where we would cancel some business, we'd reinsure some business, so you'd reduce some premium revenue, the growth initiatives would occur over a number of years. And I'd said a 3- to 5-year period to show a meaningful difference. We're keeping track of it. At the same time, you're going to have -- on your basic book of business, you're going to have a certain lapse pattern and a certain new business pattern. And if you're a disciplined underwriter, that pattern is going to vary depending on the market conditions. Then you add the 2 together, and there you go. But what do I know -- there you go is your ultimate growth rate. But what I know is we can measure the power of the integration from a revenue point of view and be able to track how one plus one is better than the 2 by themselves in any market condition. Are you following me?"

By the way, we track it in a very bottoms-up mathematical way. It comes through finance and accounting. It's got controls around it. It can be audited, both externally and by internal audit. And so we don't put up these numbers without real governance and control around it all, and that's how we manage to do it anyway. So it's all for real. And then what you have on the other side is -- what counterbalances this is any investments you have, that you make that will increase expense or normal inflation in expenses.

The market concentration of this business, when you think of the guys who were -- that you would think of are the ones who are leading brands in it.

203028,334090170,1062344,"Chubb Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per sha",1828,"Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per share compared to 274 per share prior year, again demonstrating, in my judgment, the accretive nature of our merger. As I have done in the last 2 quarters, when discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter, as if we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting. Again, this is how, as a manager, I look at the company's performance. 
The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 86, and excluding purchase accounting 85.5, that compares to an 85 last year as if we were one company back then. There are 3 components to that. Catastrophe losses were up over prior year to $144 million pretax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year. Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pretax was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses of 88.4 versus 88.9 last year, benefiting in particular from our reduced expense ratio. 
Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record-low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We have made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this is in fact contributed to the quarter's results. Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer, is prepared to make a few comments on the portfolio, if you like. Just ask him. 
Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development and cat. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one-point impact. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions and certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring certain business, reduced our premium, but improved our risk-reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and '17, though at a reduced level, and will dissipate as the year goes along. If we normalized with these underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5 difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 points of that 4.5 point difference. 
The business cancellations representing the balance, keep in mind the additional reinsurance had an outsized impact this quarter, because of the onetime under-earned premium transfer in personal lines. I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. The pricing environment continued to grow more competitive in the quarter. For our Commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. 
As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. And wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but continuing to soften, nonetheless. Globally, new business is harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. Of late, an increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. The tension of renewals is a high priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent, and I will give you some details shortly. 
Rate movement varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range. For example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% and our U.S. Major Accounts business to down 3% and our international retail Commercial P&C operations. Globally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing ranged from down a 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing ranged from flat to down 3%, and property-related pricing ranged from down 1% to down 5%. Now with all of that is context, let me give you some details on our revenue results.
In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance repurchase and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. And new business writings were up about 1.5%. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 16.5 point impact, and the Fireman's Fund had a 3-point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Overall, North America Personal Lines rates were up 1.5 and exposure change added about 3. Retention remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95%, respectively. With the legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio, as we continued to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter.
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter, while still early from what we can see today. Based on yield forecast and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. Net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollars, and up about 1.5% when normalized for the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market-based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4% or flat when normalized for underwriting actions.
The renewal retention rate for our international Commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages, and new business writings were down 2%.
International by line of business, Commercial P&C net premiums declined 3, but were flat excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions, while Personal Lines grew 3% on the same basis. Our global A&H business that premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter, and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting-related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter. Again, in sum, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollars, while market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade, given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses, both domestic and international, with both traditional core package and specialty products. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and Personal Lines business. For the large account, not for middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator, and we will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions.
We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to mid-market and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business. We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce our small commercial business owners package policies, so called BOP during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents and 1 state, it's now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business, where we have proven and deep expertise. Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by Worker's Comp, commercial auto and financial lines products. Technology and data are a differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as 4 minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our package plans won't require underwriter intervention, with an interventional goal to be 90% plus. We also recently launched the Cyber Risk products, specifically designed for micro businesses by digital distribution through CoverHound, as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for microsized small businesses.
We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owners' P&C package, all featuring straight through processing from quote to issue. A number of Chubb's existing micro-insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future. Just stay tuned. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company.
Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule, in terms of both the realized and annualized savings, as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of '18 to $800 million, up from $750 million. Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing in an especially high level, as tested recently with a number of cats, including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. But remember, outstanding claims service is what this organization is all about. And speaking of Hurricane Matthew, our early days and from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be circa $200 million pretax. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Phil. And then, we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have a $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial capital and positive cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. You'll remember that at the close of our merger, the initial delusion to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date delusion has been reduced to 16% and improvement of 13 percentage points in 3 quarters. Of course, it includes 5 points of benefit in unrealized gains because of lower interest rates. In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top-end of our estimated range and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to the management of our portfolio.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in the investment income, including the level of interest rates, prepayments fees on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pretax and include $307 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads of $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio, primarily from the improvement to equity markets, and a $95 million loss from FX. Our investments are unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. 
Net loss reserves increased $315 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pretax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% from short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident year's 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse developments for legacy environmental liability exposures, which are now included in our corporate segment. 
As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our Asbestos review in the 4. Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter, net of reinsurance were $144 million pretax or $107 million after-tax, principally from U.S. weather-related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million, $200 million related to Personal Lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines. The $200 million Personal Lines reinsurance premium included a $128 million of onetime unearned premium reserve transfers, which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only. Excluding the onetime transfers, the annual impact of Personal Lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million.
As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of integration-related savings. There is no increase in our integration and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development because of the jurisdictions in which the development occurred. I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

The new organization really hasn't missed a beat in terms of service to both agents and clients. And I think the agents have been extremely complementary on how focus team is on finding solutions to risk exposures. Just one quick example, we were all recently at the CIAB and we ran into an agent who had a Fortune 500 CEO, who had a Personal Lines risk, and -- but it included both cattle and a horse ranch. And I would tell you that in the past, legacy Chubb would have absolutely struggled to figure out a solution to that. And today, we were able to put that together in a very seamless way, and our new capabilities in that area are unmatched and will only become crisper and better as we go along. So we're very excited about that. As respect to the piece about some concentration, yes, I would suggest to you that some of the agents have been a little concerned about the concentration. We'd seen that more so, and if anything and how they move some of the Fireman's Fund that we had expected that in the retention and that had shown up. You have to remember that the Fireman's Fund book was a conversion and we anticipated that there would be more price dislocation on the Fireman's Fund.

We've been working with these teams to implement strategic and tactical changes to the taxable, municipal and our international portfolios to improve risk-adjusted returns. In addition, earlier this year, I think it is important we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the B -- BB sector of the high-yield bond market, which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain in stocks of about 7. The result of all of these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of overall $120 million annually, above what the portfolios run rate would have been since the time of acquisition. This has been accomplished with a better balance to our asset allocation, overall reduction in portfolio volatility, while we've maintained an average rating of AA."

And we by the spring so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where it either was at meeting our return expectations or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done. And we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secure additional reinsurance. Let me go a step further though, because I think there is this question out there also, well, risk-reward ratio and how do you think about that? And how do you as investors judge that? First of all, I don't believe you can judge that. We can judge that. But you can't accept that how our ultimate results turn out. And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting and reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that? You ask yourself that question. We would -- the reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. But it's rather a risk management and capital management tool. We have very well-established views and guidelines and process to determine and manage our risk tolerances. Our appetite for individual per risk volatility is an example. And our accumulations of how much we would take in any one geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur. We have very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives, do we retain the risk, do we reinsure it, and if we are going to reinsure it, what's the best reinsurance structure, and the pricing alternatives? We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think our risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net, and adjust as facts and circumstance both company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly, the question you ask yourself, if you are me in the very beginning when you do something on a merger like this is, do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue? Or do you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business, to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis? And for me, it's a no-brainer. You just do that. And -- anyway, thank you for the question. And I answered more than you asked."

Look, lost trend hasn't -- it's not like there is no lost trend. There is inflation and claims that varies by class, but it isn't like it has disappeared. It continues and you see it in certain classes, where it rears to Ted, and then in other classes, it's there. It just is a bit more benign. Pricing is flat or were down. And it's interesting to me the way I listen to people talk about the market, because they'll say, well, see, though the market is not softening because the rate of decline of prices has ameliorated. Well, that's almost -- that's mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate. Well, that's still softening. And even if it's flat, it doesn't keep pace with lost cost trend. So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And at that point, when it shows up, does that mean a market turns? No, there is a lot of capital and there is a hunger for a rate of return. Even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE, which is miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me. That is attractive to many, where there is trillions of dollars sitting in negative returns right now and just hungry for yield. And if they can get absolute yield of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% on an absolute, forget risk-adjusted basis, they are interested. So you will continue to see more capital coming into the business. So I'm not imagining and I don't run our company. I can tell you, we don't build the strategy based on a market turn. We base it on the market we see."

We, first of all, had reorganized ourselves between all the disciplines, between actuarial, underwriting, marketing and sales, where we can, in a faster and more practical way, react to each region in the United States, with each one behaves a little differently, with the states behave differently in terms of both competitive behavior and what we see from a financial profit/loss perspective of pricing. Number two, we are right now in the middle of making investments and executing on actions around what will ultimately come out in the next -- I can't -- I'm not going to predict the month precisely, but what we're going to start rolling out a digital experience around our high net worth business where customers will be able to interact with us and procure service and actually manage coverage in a more digital way. On foundational technology, there is a need to make large investment to update and be state-of-the-art in our foundational technology around underwriting and claims. Claims, we've already done it, and we will be investing in the underwriting side, and plans have been put to do that. In product, Paul began to tell you one of the initiatives that we're already engaged in and that will emerge, and that is the high net worth. There is a large segment to that population that has farm and ranch exposure. And you can't -- typically, you can't get it all from one carrier. We have the capability with our farm and ranch capabilities as well as our high net worth capabilities. We're putting them together. We've already been piloting where we'll be able to serve that segment, and that distinguishes us from anybody else one-stop shop. Coverage is around cyber liability, which, on a personal basis and, particularly, for high net worth, is a new exposure. We've rolled out product to address that area before anyone else in the market did. And so we're -- this is not something where you'd throw a switch, and I said from the beginning, it'd take a couple years, but we have a lot underway."

But let me take your A&H. And by the way, on small commercial, when you ask could it be material, I'm going to repeat to you one thing I've said before. First of all, it's about a $90 billion market in the United States. Number two, average premiums, though, keep in mind a couple of thousand dollars. So it takes -- you got to write a lot of customers to build -- to cast a real shot. In a number of years, in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business with a D on the end of it, okay? That's what I mean by significant.  When you talk about A&H, it's in 2 pieces. First, in the combined, we do a work site marketing, and we have great technology, and we now have quietly built over $100 million of business that is growing quickly, where we're doing supplemental A&H products, not traditional health, sort of like the same thing that you'd see Allstate or Aflac are doing. And we are competing very well in that business. We have now introduced it to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an Employee Benefits division, and so we can come in where it is 50 to a couple hundred lives, that's a sweet spot for us, and with technology and enrollers offer supplemental health products such as accident insurance, dread disease, hospital cash, et cetera. And that is a real initiative that we think has legs that over a number of years is kind of grow substantial business. Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our Major Accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global business travel, 2 corporations, where they pay for the insurance for employees. We are -- that is a real initiative for us, and it is part of our cross-selling, along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul just to give you a better sense of that cross-selling."

And also, we co-strength the organization where we've added resources and distribution. I will remind you that with Chubb, we picked up 48 branch offices that are just terrific assets for us. Some of the things that we're selling is clearly the specialty product that is brought to the table, things like environmental, things like global programs, a broader excess appetite, deeper financial lines, cyber, international, construction, transactional risk. These are all specialty plays that our branch operation is just doing a wonderful job of distributing and getting to our relationships and adding that cross-sell. A couple of quick examples, on the upper middle market side, we had a global digital company where the Chubb organization add a small specialty product. This client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty after the new ACE product with the Chubb relationship and the Chubb team. And this organization pulled together to write in an excess of a $3 million deal. So there is a number of those examples that I can run you through, but it just brings to life one example where the organization has brought together additional capabilities."

An agent, a friend of mine, told me a story where one of our clients in the personal lines world runs a business in the health care industry, and this prospect of his was very anxious to get a Chubb quote. He explained to them that he didn't think that this risk was within Chubb's appetite, but he also admitted to the client, the prospect, that in fact, now that the legacy Chubb had changed to new Chubb, that the appetite has shifted as well because legacy ACE was bringing on something more capabilities and skills. So he approached us. And he was shocked that within days, we put together a very competitive program. The underwriter that he knew helped guide his colleague through the relationship. And we wrote the account with several hundred thousand dollars. That in itself is personally very satisfying for me. But also whats very satisfying that this agent has really turned on to Chubb right now, and their submission activity has increased nicely."

And so people are going to compete simply on price but not the same quality of product and service. And that's the game. That's fine. We'll -- you'll always have that. And as I've said from the beginning, we expect that with the merger, there would naturally be others who would come into the space. It makes sense. It ought to happen. That doesn't disturb us. But your ability to actually become a true high net worth player requires a lot of investment, a lot of patience and -- because you got to build a hell of capability and serve us, and you got to be able to follow your customers where they have exposure. And by the way, you got to have a balance sheet and an appetite for greater volatility or risk because high net worth behaves like a commercial account, not a traditional personal lines account."

And remember this, which is very interesting to me. I told you that, really, you can't be Pollyanna-ish about it, that in the beginning, we would take some actions that would have dissynergies, hate the word, give me a better word, where we would cancel some business, we'd reinsure some business, so you'd reduce some premium revenue, the growth initiatives would occur over a number of years. And I'd said a 3- to 5-year period to show a meaningful difference. We're keeping track of it.

And that's all that's a reflection of. And look, it's a little like the E&S business. In reinsurance, you have to be prepared in the way we run reinsurance, a very little differently, where it has more volatility to it based on the market signature. You will have moments where you -- there will be moments, when you may grow very quickly, and then you got to be willing and prepared that on the other side, there's volatility and you just shut like mad if you have to, if your intent is to earn an underwriting profit. Wholesale E&S is next like that. It expands -- the market expands or shrinks depending on market conditions."

203028,334090170,1062798,"Chubb Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per sha",1828,"Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 288 per share compared to 274 per share prior year, again demonstrating, in my judgment, the accretive nature of our merger. As I have done in the last 2 quarters, when discussing our underwriting results in premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter, as if we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting. Again, this is how, as a manager, I look at the company's performance. 
The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 86, and excluding purchase accounting 85.5, that compares to an 85 last year as if we were one company back then. There are 3 components to that. Catastrophe losses were up over prior year to $144 million pretax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year. Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pretax was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses of 88.4 versus 88.9 last year, benefiting in particular from our reduced expense ratio. 
Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record-low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We have made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this is in fact contributed to the quarter's results. Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer, is prepared to make a few comments on the portfolio, if you like. Just ask him. 
Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development and cat. 
Turning to premium revenue. Total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one-point impact. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions and certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring certain business, reduced our premium, but improved our risk-reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and '17, though at a reduced level, and will dissipate as the year goes along. If we normalized with these underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5 difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 points of that 4.5 point difference. 
The business cancellations representing the balance, keep in mind the additional reinsurance had an outsized impact this quarter, because of the onetime under-earned premium transfer in personal lines. I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. The pricing environment continued to grow more competitive in the quarter. For our Commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. 
As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. And wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but continuing to soften, nonetheless. Globally, new business is harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. Of late, an increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. The tension of renewals is a high priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent, and I will give you some details shortly. 
Rate movement varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range. For example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% and our U.S. Major Accounts business to down 3% and our international retail Commercial P&C operations. Globally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing ranged from down a 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing ranged from flat to down 3%, and property-related pricing ranged from down 1% to down 5%. Now with all of that is context, let me give you some details on our revenue results.
In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance repurchase and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. And new business writings were up about 1.5%. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 16.5 point impact, and the Fireman's Fund had a 3-point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Overall, North America Personal Lines rates were up 1.5 and exposure change added about 3. Retention remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95%, respectively. With the legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio, as we continued to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter.
Net premiums for our Agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter, while still early from what we can see today. Based on yield forecast and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results. 
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. Net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollars, and up about 1.5% when normalized for the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market-based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4% or flat when normalized for underwriting actions.
The renewal retention rate for our international Commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages, and new business writings were down 2%.
International by line of business, Commercial P&C net premiums declined 3, but were flat excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions, while Personal Lines grew 3% on the same basis. Our global A&H business that premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter, and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting-related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter. Again, in sum, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollars, while market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade, given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses, both domestic and international, with both traditional core package and specialty products. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and Personal Lines business. For the large account, not for middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator, and we will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions.
We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to mid-market and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business. We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce our small commercial business owners package policies, so called BOP during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents and 1 state, it's now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business, where we have proven and deep expertise. Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by Worker's Comp, commercial auto and financial lines products. Technology and data are a differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as 4 minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our package plans won't require underwriter intervention, with an interventional goal to be 90% plus. We also recently launched the Cyber Risk products, specifically designed for micro businesses by digital distribution through CoverHound, as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for microsized small businesses.
We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owners' P&C package, all featuring straight through processing from quote to issue. A number of Chubb's existing micro-insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future. Just stay tuned. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends, as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company.
Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule, in terms of both the realized and annualized savings, as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of '18 to $800 million, up from $750 million. Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing in an especially high level, as tested recently with a number of cats, including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. But remember, outstanding claims service is what this organization is all about. And speaking of Hurricane Matthew, our early days and from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be circa $200 million pretax. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Phil. And then, we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have a $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial capital and positive cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. You'll remember that at the close of our merger, the initial delusion to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date delusion has been reduced to 16% and improvement of 13 percentage points in 3 quarters. Of course, it includes 5 points of benefit in unrealized gains because of lower interest rates. In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top-end of our estimated range and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to the management of our portfolio.
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in the investment income, including the level of interest rates, prepayments fees on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pretax and include $307 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads of $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio, primarily from the improvement to equity markets, and a $95 million loss from FX. Our investments are unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. 
Net loss reserves increased $315 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pretax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% from short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident year's 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse developments for legacy environmental liability exposures, which are now included in our corporate segment. 
As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our Asbestos review in the 4. Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter, net of reinsurance were $144 million pretax or $107 million after-tax, principally from U.S. weather-related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million, $200 million related to Personal Lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines. The $200 million Personal Lines reinsurance premium included a $128 million of onetime unearned premium reserve transfers, which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only. Excluding the onetime transfers, the annual impact of Personal Lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million.
As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of integration-related savings. There is no increase in our integration and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development because of the jurisdictions in which the development occurred. I'll turn the call back over to Helen."

The new organization really hasn't missed a beat in terms of service to both agents and clients. And I think the agents have been extremely complementary on how focus team is on finding solutions to risk exposures. Just one quick example, we were all recently at the CIAB and we ran into an agent who had a Fortune 500 CEO, who had a Personal Lines risk, and -- but it included both cattle and a horse ranch. And I would tell you that in the past, legacy Chubb would have absolutely struggled to figure out a solution to that. And today, we were able to put that together in a very seamless way, and our new capabilities in that area are unmatched and will only become crisper and better as we go along. So we're very excited about that. As respect to the piece about some concentration, yes, I would suggest to you that some of the agents have been a little concerned about the concentration. We'd seen that more so, and if anything and how they move some of the Fireman's Fund that we had expected that in the retention and that had shown up. You have to remember that the Fireman's Fund book was a conversion and we anticipated that there would be more price dislocation on the Fireman's Fund.

The assets have been placed with several of our managers with whom we share a long history of success. We've been working with these teams to implement strategic and tactical changes to the taxable, municipal and our international portfolios to improve risk-adjusted returns. In addition, earlier this year, I think it is important we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the B -- BB sector of the high-yield bond market, which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain in stocks of about 7. The result of all of these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of overall $120 million annually, above what the portfolios run rate would have been since the time of acquisition. This has been accomplished with a better balance to our asset allocation, overall reduction in portfolio volatility, while we've maintained an average rating of AA."

And we by the spring so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where it either was at meeting our return expectations or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done. And we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secure additional reinsurance. Let me go a step further though, because I think there is this question out there also, well, risk-reward ratio and how do you think about that? And how do you as investors judge that? First of all, I don't believe you can judge that. We can judge that. But you can't accept that how our ultimate results turn out. And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting and reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that? You ask yourself that question. We would -- the reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. But it's rather a risk management and capital management tool. We have very well-established views and guidelines and process to determine and manage our risk tolerances. Our appetite for individual per risk volatility is an example. And our accumulations of how much we would take in any one geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur. We have very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives, do we retain the risk, do we reinsure it, and if we are going to reinsure it, what's the best reinsurance structure, and the pricing alternatives? We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think our risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net, and adjust as facts and circumstance both company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly, the question you ask yourself, if you are me in the very beginning when you do something on a merger like this is, do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue? Or do you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business, to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis? And for me, it's a no-brainer. You just do that. And -- anyway, thank you for the question. And I answered more than you asked."

Look, lost trend hasn't -- it's not like there is no lost trend. There is inflation and claims that varies by class, but it isn't like it has disappeared. It continues and you see it in certain classes, where it rears to Ted, and then in other classes, it's there. It just is a bit more benign. Pricing is flat or were down. And it's interesting to me the way I listen to people talk about the market, because they'll say, well, see, though the market is not softening because the rate of decline of prices has ameliorated. Well, that's almost -- that's mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate. Well, that's still softening. And even if it's flat, it doesn't keep pace with lost cost trend. So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And at that point, when it shows up, does that mean a market turns? No, there is a lot of capital and there is a hunger for a rate of return. Even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE, which is miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me. That is attractive to many, where there is trillions of dollars sitting in negative returns right now and just hungry for yield. And if they can get absolute yield of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% on an absolute, forget risk-adjusted basis, they are interested. So you will continue to see more capital coming into the business. So I'm not imagining and I don't run our company. I can tell you, we don't build the strategy based on a market turn. We base it on the market we see."

Claims, we've already done it, and we will be investing in the underwriting side, and plans have been put to do that.

There is a large segment to that population that has farm and ranch exposure. And you can't -- typically, you can't get it all from one carrier. We have the capability with our farm and ranch capabilities as well as our high net worth capabilities. We're putting them together. We've already been piloting where we'll be able to serve that segment, and that distinguishes us from anybody else one-stop shop. Coverage is around cyber liability, which, on a personal basis and, particularly, for high net worth, is a new exposure. We've rolled out product to address that area before anyone else in the market did. And so we're -- this is not something where you'd throw a switch, and I said from the beginning, it'd take a couple years, but we have a lot underway."

But let me take your A&H. And by the way, on small commercial, when you ask could it be material, I'm going to repeat to you one thing I've said before. First of all, it's about a $90 billion market in the United States. Number two, average premiums, though, keep in mind a couple of thousand dollars. So it takes -- you got to write a lot of customers to build -- to cast a real shot. In a number of years, in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business with a D on the end of it, okay? That's what I mean by significant.  When you talk about A&H, it's in 2 pieces. First, in the combined, we do a work site marketing, and we have great technology, and we now have quietly built over $100 million of business that is growing quickly, where we're doing supplemental A&H products, not traditional health, sort of like the same thing that you'd see Allstate or Aflac are doing. And we are competing very well in that business. We have now introduced it to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an Employee Benefits division, and so we can come in where it is 50 to a couple hundred lives, that's a sweet spot for us, and with technology and enrollers offer supplemental health products such as accident insurance, dread disease, hospital cash, et cetera. And that is a real initiative that we think has legs that over a number of years is kind of grow substantial business. Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our Major Accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global business travel, 2 corporations, where they pay for the insurance for employees. We are -- that is a real initiative for us, and it is part of our cross-selling, along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul just to give you a better sense of that cross-selling."

Some of the things that we're selling is clearly the specialty product that is brought to the table, things like environmental, things like global programs, a broader excess appetite, deeper financial lines, cyber, international, construction, transactional risk. These are all specialty plays that our branch operation is just doing a wonderful job of distributing and getting to our relationships and adding that cross-sell. A couple of quick examples, on the upper middle market side, we had a global digital company where the Chubb organization add a small specialty product. This client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty after the new ACE product with the Chubb relationship and the Chubb team. And this organization pulled together to write in an excess of a $3 million deal.

He explained to them that he didn't think that this risk was within Chubb's appetite, but he also admitted to the client, the prospect, that in fact, now that the legacy Chubb had changed to new Chubb, that the appetite has shifted as well because legacy ACE was bringing on something more capabilities and skills. So he approached us. And he was shocked that within days, we put together a very competitive program. The underwriter that he knew helped guide his colleague through the relationship. And we wrote the account with several hundred thousand dollars. That in itself is personally very satisfying for me.

And then just a follow-up on the small commercial effort. I guess, Evan, can you help me understand sort of -- I guess what I'm struggling with there, right, is that business is obviously, as you said, it's very low ticket, very sticky, doesn't change carriers a lot and is very dependent on sort of the experience with the CSR, how much is much remorse certainly with the customer. What's sort of your edge going to be? Is it going to be a new take on service centers? Is it going to be a new take on front-end quoting to make the CSRs want to do business with you instead of someone else? I mean, what sort of the hook, I guess?"

First of all, in the agency, they are predisposed to grow their business with Chubb, okay. The market concentration of this business, when you think of the guys who were -- that you would think of are the ones who are leading brands in it. Well, in aggregate, they have 20% market share of a $90 billion market, so it's incredibly spread. And there's a lot of carriers in there that, frankly, the agents  if you take the relationship and their -- with Chubb, they want to grow that relationship, and they have more confidence in that. So you start with that. Number two, our technology and our ability to quote, find an issue and a 4-minute to do it and that you don't touch, that's something that is a great differentiator to CSRs. And then that we'll offer the total product package plus specialties wrapped around it that others don't have is a differentiator. So I think when you add all 3 together, over time, we will grind this up. And this is not a passing game where you make a 50-yard gain in one play. This is a grind it out foot-by-foot, yard-by-yard. And that's great. That's what we're in the business of. We're all not trying to get out of business tomorrow. We're here for a long time building a company. And this is part of the effort. So it's not something like what's the update every quarter? How is it looking? Come on, you measure it over years."

And that's all that's a reflection of. And look, it's a little like the E&S business. In reinsurance, you have to be prepared in the way we run reinsurance, a very little differently, where it has more volatility to it based on the market signature. You will have moments where you -- there will be moments, when you may grow very quickly, and then you got to be willing and prepared that on the other side, there's volatility and you just shut like mad if you have to, if your intent is to earn an underwriting profit. Wholesale E&S is next like that. It expands -- the market expands or shrinks depending on market conditions."

And beyond that, we're in Australia and -- where we have a portfolio and are growing that. Other than that, it's where our customers emanating out of the U.S. or one of those markets may, in fact, have a property or an exposure in another country. Then we have a Lloyd's platform that is used to be able to quote an issue that alongside their U.S. policy because they have a home in Mexico or they have a home in Colombia. So we can service it on a global basis. There's an ocean of expanding high net worth into a whole lot of countries.
