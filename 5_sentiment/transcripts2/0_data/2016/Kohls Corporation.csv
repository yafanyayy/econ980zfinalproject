As we announced earlier this month, comp sales increased 40 basis points for the quarter. Though we were pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps, sales were volatile during the quarter and were below our expectations. 
Holiday sales, which include the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, increased 4% and store traffic was 400 basis points better than industry average. This strength, however, was substantially offset by softness in early November and in January when demand for cold-weather goods was especially low. 
For the year, comp sales increased 70 basis points. Looking at the metrics of the comp, the components of the comp for the 40 basis-point increase in the fourth quarter were as follows: Transactions per store increased 20 basis points for the quarter: Average transaction value also increased 20 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 30 basis points with a drop in units per transaction of 10 basis points. 
The components of the 70 basis comp increase for fiscal 2015 were as follows: Transactions per store decreased 20 basis points for the year; average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 130 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 40 basis points. 
From a line of business perspective, footwear and Home were the strongest categories for both the quarter and the year. Accessories was the weakest category in both periods. On a regional basis, the West region was the strongest for both the quarter and the year, while the Mid-Atlantic and South Central were the most difficult regions. 
Gross margin was challenging for the quarter, down approximately 80 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher promotional markdowns during the holiday season as well as an increase in shipping costs versus last year, driven by our 30% increase in digital orders. The effect of the increased penetration of the national brand was as expected as penetration grew to 58% for the quarter and 52% in the year. The growth in penetration was similar for both the quarter and the year. 
Gross margin was flat for the first 3 quarters of the year, however, gross margin for the year decreased 27 basis points to 36.1% of sales due to the fourth quarter performance, which was lower than our guidance for the year of flat to up 20 basis points. 
SG&A dollars increased $60 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleverage 80 basis points. As expected, marketing expenses deleveraged as we invested heavily to drive sales. Many of those expenditures will not be repeated in 2016. 
Store payroll also deleveraged due to ongoing wage pressure and omni-channel support and Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. During the fourth quarter, almost 30% of our digital sales units were either shipped from or picked up in our stores, more than 2x last year's penetration rate. 
BFC and IT also deleveraged. Store expenses, distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores, corporate and credit all leverage. For the year, SG&A expenses were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% over 2014, which was consistent with our guidance of 1.5% to 2.5% increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 30 basis points. Store payroll, corporate, e-commerce, fulfillment centers and IT deleveraged for the year while marketing, credit and distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores all leveraged. 
Depreciation expense was $239 million for the quarter. For the year, depreciation was $934 million, generally in line with our guidance of $940 million. Depreciation increased in both periods primarily due to  higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter and decreased $13 million to $327 million for the year. 
As a reminder, our original guidance was $335 million. The decreases are due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing early in the year. 
Our income tax rate was 35.9% for the quarter and 36.3% for the year. The tax rate increased 60 basis points during both periods as the prior year periods included some favorable tax audit settlements. This was versus our guidance of 37% for the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, net income was $296 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.58. Excluding $169 million of debt extinguishment losses that we recorded earlier in the year, net income was $781 million for the year and diluted EPS was $4.01. We recently closed 2 stores, 1 in Texas and other in California. We currently operate 1,164 stores. Gross square footage is 100.4 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.8 million square feet. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $707 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately half of last year's balance. Higher inventory, lower payables and payment of the debt premium in cash contributed to the decrease. 
Inventory dollars per store were 5.7% higher than year-end 2014. Units per store were up 5% higher than the end of last year. The increases are primarily within national brands, which are up more than 10% over last year. We expect inventory to be down low single-digit at the end of the first quarter and down mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
AP as a percent of inventory decreased 865 basis points to 31%. Almost half of the increase -- excuse me, half of the decreases is due to the anniversary of last year's port strike. Lower year-over-year January receipts and higher inventory levels also contributed to the decrease. 
Our capital expenditures were $690 million for the year, approximately $100 million lower than our original expectations. IT spending was approximately $300 million, which was $50 million lower than expectations, as we are buying our restores closer to installing our new point-of-sale system. 
Store experience and refresh spending, which includes beauty, remodels, new stores and general store upkeep was $250 million, about $50 million lower than our original plans as we reduced the number of stores we're remodeling and revised our in-store merchandising plans. 
Base capital spending of approximately $150 million was generally consistent with our original plans. We expect capital expenditures of $825 million in 2016, approximately $135 million higher than 2015. About $60 million of the increase was related to timing shift in IT, mainly due to our register purchased for those -- for that new point-of-sale system this year. 
In addition, we are accelerating construction of a 5th e-commerce fulfillment center with construction beginning in 2016 with the goal to open in time for fall 2017. 
CapEx is expected to include $375 million for IT spending, $250 million for store strategies, including new stores, remodels, beauty and initiatives and new brand rollouts; and $200 million in base capital, including investment and the e-fulfillment center. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 187 million for the quarter and 195 million for the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our stock, bringing our total for the year to 17.4 million shares repurchased. We ended the year with 187 million shares of stock outstanding. 
On Wednesday, our board approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. The $0.50 dividend is payable on March 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

I want to take a few comments regarding 2015 [indiscernible] This past 2015 came on top of a very strong holiday performance last year. And were out our fifth consecutive quarter of positive sales increases since the launch of the Greatness Agenda. During the most competitive competitive period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we achieved a 4% sales increase with customers definitely choosing Kohl's. 
It's clear to us that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is working, and we're making progress towards our goal of being the most engaging retailer in America. We've seen great success in many of the major initiatives engineered under our plan. And our focus on product initiatives, we've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio and have seen double-digit increases in sales of most national brands. 
We've put our state in the ground to be destination for active and wellness and have dramatically increased our share of this growing category, positioning us for success in the future. 
We made 5 big investments for holiday, active and wellness, premium electronics, beauty, license entertainment and team apparel. And in total, we achieved our plan for the fourth quarter for these investments and achieved a double-digit sales increase combined. And finally, our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store portfolio. 
This means we'll be both improving the in-store experience for the customer and very importantly, better managing our inventory across the company. 
And our focus around omni-channel initiatives, we're seeing the results on our multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in digital technology with online demand driving sales. Online generated demand was up 25% for the year and 30% for the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, much of that demand was fulfilled with best-in-class Ship from Store enablement and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capability. Both of these capabilities will create more opportunity for future growth, provide a greater customer experience and leverage our store portfolio in a meaningful way. 
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 11 million customers and growing and new mobile in-store capabilities, including mobile pay were successful as well. Our digital and mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards program has quickly become an industry-leading loyalty program. And we now have the opportunity to cultivate that membership base and increase our share of wallet from them by giving them more relevant and more personal experiences that throw them into the brand and back into the store. 
Moving on to looking forward, I want to provide an update on the Greatness Agenda, organization and stores. While I'm happy with the progress we've made on many of our key initiatives, we were very clear in the expected outcomes of the Greatness Agenda. By 2017, we have targeted 3 outcomes: 90th percentile on associate engagement; best-in-class customer engagement; and $21 billion in sales. 
I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made on the first 2 outcomes, but we are right where we need to be to achieving those 2 goals. But for many reasons, including a difficult macroeconomic and retail environment, it's unlikely we'll achieve our sales goal on the time lines we originally set, but I do believe will achieve that goal within a short time after. 
It's clear though that we need to move with greater speed and agility, accelerate plan changes in our business model more quickly and focus our resources in the most productive assets and projects, while moving away from those that are not delivering results. We need to embrace the evolving behaviors of our customers and take actions to support the long-term health and success of our business. 
We began those efforts recently by realigning our organization and leadership in buying and planning, store environment and design and digital and infrastructure technology. We changed the scope of some of our leaders and teams, reorganized some functions and brought key teams under shared leaders. The purpose of those changes is to enable efficiency and decision-making, leverage our biggest asset, our inventory, more effectively and deploy capital resources smart clearly around investments to drive both sales and profitability. Most importantly, there were targeted to increase our ability to respond with more speed to our customer. 
As you likely read in our press release this morning, we're announcing several updates to our store portfolio and omni-channel strategy. We will be piloting 7 new small format stores, approximately 35,000 square foot in size that will open this year, which will help both inform future stores size and rationalization and identify omni-channel opportunities as well. We'll also continue our Fila pilot with 2 new stores and open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space. In addition, we'll close 18 underperforming stores, which represent less than 1% of our total sales. We expect to announce the specific store locations by the end of March. 
The closures are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $10 million. As a result of both the store closures and the organizational realignment, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $170 million in charges that will be recognized in the first and second quarter of 2016. 
I'm very happy to say that every affected Kohl's stores associate will be offered the opportunity to work in a nearby Kohl's store location or if they prefer a competitive severance package. These organizational store changes are a good example of how we intend to capture more expense savings, an effort which will be an important part of how we reached our sales goals and increased profitability at the same time. While I believe most investors give us high marks for expense management, we know we need to do better. Traditionally, our goal has been to leverage our expenses assuming we achieve a 2% sales increase. And despite the fact that we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omni-channel initiatives, we're moving to lower our leverage point to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. 
The blueprint for that effort will be a plan to reimagine all of our decision-making processes and better utilize our previous investment in technology to do so. I've challenged all of our teams to explore ways that will find more efficiency in our work and focus on speed in reaching our goals. 
Although we've made progress in both our marketing spend and speed, we believe there are opportunities in that area of our cost structure as part of this effort as well. Our associates have wholeheartedly embraced the Greatness Agenda, and we've seen an evolution in the way we work together. By empowering our teams against the goal of greater speed and giving them the space they need to work in, in a more streamlined way, I believe will continue to develop ways do more with less, something Kohl's has always been known for. 
The other area of opportunity I want to discuss is the work being the around lowering the level of our inventory. This is especially critical in allowing our stores to be more efficient, lower our cost and deliver a better customer experience at the same time. Since 2011, our average inventory per store has grown approximately 15%. While some of this was funded to add inventory for the digital portion of our business and to aid in our national brand initiatives, we're committed to manage it more intelligently. 
Key areas of focus will be around effective implementation of our localization initiative, leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand picked up in store and gaining efficiency and buying and planning through our recent reorganization. I expect that we can reduce our inventory per store by 10% by 2017. And the more near-term, we expect to enter this fall season with inventory per store down mid-single digits. 
Finally, I also want to answer you that we are committed to invest in the long-term health of our business. We'll also considered to be good stewards of our capital. As you saw in our press release, our board has approved an 11% increase in our dividend, and we intend to continue our share buyback plan. 
I'll now turn it back to Wes to give your guidance for fiscal 2016."

We expect earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.25 for fiscal 2016. The guidance is based upon the following assumptions: Comp sales of flat to up 1%; total sales down 50 basis points to up 50 basis points, this includes the effect of the loss sales from the coast stores in 2016. However, we would expect to retain some of these sales in nearby stores and through the digital channel. Gross margin rate performance of flat to up 20 basis points. We would expect to have significant pressure on the first quarter of approximately 150 basis points drop versus last year as we continue to aggressively clear excess merchandise. 
We would expect to see improvement in each of the remaining quarters as our inventory levels dropped below last year and become sequentially better throughout the year with the biggest improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
SG&A dollar increase of 1% to 2%. Our expectations for first quarter SG&A dollar growth would be 3% to 4% as we've sifted the timing of our advertising expenses and it's more weighted to the first quarter this year. 
Depreciation expense of $940 million. The SG&A and depreciation guidance includes the partial year savings from the store closures in 2016. Interest expense of $310 million, tax rate of 37%. This guidance also assumes share repurchases of $600 million at an average price of $50 per share. 
We would expect lease cost and PP&E write-offs related to store closures and severance associate it with the store closures and corporate reorganization to be approximately $150 million to $170 million with $55 million to $65 million of this charge included in Q1. The earnings guidance I just gave excludes any of this impact as of these are just estimates at this time.

We'll complete that in the spring. We'll have all the stores than by the end of the second quarter, a little earlier than we did this year. So we feel very good about that. We're also saving money on a lot of the investment in the stores. We've got investment about in half because we saw the same lift in modified, a little bit less expensive version as we did in the earlier version. From a loyalty perspective, we really anniversary that in October. We didn't expect to see any lift when we built the plan to the goal we shared with you guys last October, I guess, October of '14. We didn't really got any lift from that. They continue to spend a lot more money than nonmembers of you that self-selecting but even like from the, were still seeing a lift. We feel very good about loyalty program. The focus really in 2016 is to move them along the value chain. So try to get them to spend more money at Kohl's as loyalty members and then we are working behind the scenes as we roll out our new point-of-sale system in the fall to do a better job of being able to prescreen those folks behind the scenes to preapproved for Kohl's credit card and explain the great additional value they get with that. So that will be more of the focus as we move into '16 and '17, not so much trying to sign up more loyalty members although that's certainly a goal, but trying to move them into be more loyal customers is for spending more in loyalty or eventually moving them to a Kohl's credit card customer."

So that's a good thing. To be totally honest with you, we had set a goal at the beginning of last year to have a large reduction and ad expenditures and we ended up spending. And fundamentally, what happened there is as we got into the fourth quarter and we saw the really strength or lack of strength in our business and weakness across the board, we made a determination to be really aggressive in terms of ensuring that we were maximizing our traffic levels in the store. And so on the positive side, marketing leveraged, we actually reduced our marketing spend, which is something that long-term we intend to continue to do. On the negative side, I think, our expectations at the beginning of the year were more optimistic than we ended up. Marketing is definitely a component part of the areas that we are looking to reduce expenses in over the course of the future years. And frankly, the key to unlock there, we really believe is personalization. I mean, that's going to be the driver, whether it's the application of our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program to improve, as Wes covered both total sales with  those customers but also conversion over time to consider credit card as a reasonable alternative as well or it's just making the spend that we have around personalization more effective regardless of whether that's print or direct mail for the utilization of our apps. So we set goals for ourselves and we definitely think that it's important part after store payroll, marketing is our single biggest expense. So we know if we're really going to reduce expenses over time, we've got to do a better job at marketing."

I think 2 things, first and foremost, one of the big changes that we made this year, we alluded to it in the call was the decision to reorganize our buying and planning structure. And essentially bring together our e-com and blankets with our brick-and-mortar buying and planning teams. So while at the time we built a separate e-com team, it made sense for us because it was a small but growing business. Today it's a very big business but most importantly, from the customers perspective, she sees this through 1 lens. So we know that we need 1 view of the customer and we to achieve that is through 1 organization long-term. What that means, we think, is that we'll do a better job of inventory management as a result. So I think 1 way we're looking at this is inventory management effectively and that will include using the inventories we have in our stores to fulfill online orders. That was very successful all year last year and it peaked dramatically in the fourth quarter. And we suspect that will continue to be a become a big tool to both improved inventory leverage but also make us more efficient. The other piece that we know we have to find a better long-term solution to is around fulfillment costs. And that's critical for us. And so we are investing, Wes called out some of the big things, everything from the beginning of the building of a new e-fulfillment center through the implementation of tools inside our stores to meet our fulfillment more efficient and less expensive and improve speed. So those are the 2 lines that we're focused on. Michelle is kind the overseeing the buying and planning review and Sony is very much involved in making sure that we're leveraging on the fulfillment side. I do know, Wes, if you want. . ."

And we probably would say that the biggest opportunity we have on speed is naturally inside our private and exclusive brand organization. Half of our business we work on longer the times and generally, we've had success in some areas.

It's more than 1/3 of our overall SG&A, so that's going up. And I think we can be more efficient, as I mentioned, Ship from Store and BOPUS that will help mitigate that. We actually experienced health care deflation this year. We had a tremendous year in terms of that, not what we're lucky we didn't have a ton of large wins, which can really swing it one way or the other but we've made a lot of continues and will this initiative still relatively young population that helps us well. But we're going to cut advertising. We -- I think Bob asked we spent $1.11 [ph] billion this year. We wanted to spend $1 billion. The goal is to spend $1 billion this year, a building spend a little bit less than that. We can get more efficient in the e-commerce fulfillment centers. And we're going to get more efficient incorporate with the reorganization that we have, we have to be smarter about when positions opens up, not filling them. And just increasing the speed across the organization I think that will be a big help. But those are kind of the Baucus were going to try to do to offset IT expenses are also going to go up.

Lower inventory level is less material handling, is less distribution expense, it's significantly less workload in the store and that has a big impact in a positive way on store payroll.

As we announced earlier this month, comp sales increased 40 basis points for the quarter. Though we were pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps, sales were volatile during the quarter and were below our expectations. 
Holiday sales, which include the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, increased 4%, and store traffic was 400 basis points better than industry average. This strength, however, was substantially offset by softness in early November and in January when demand for cold-weather goods was especially low. 
For the year, comp sales increased 70 basis points. Looking at the metrics of the comp, the components of the comp for the 40 basis point increase in the fourth quarter were as follows: Transactions per store increased 20 basis points for the quarter; average transaction value also increased 20 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 30 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 10 basis points. 
The components of the 70 basis comp increase for fiscal 2015 were as follows: Transactions per store decreased 20 basis points for the year; average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 130 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 40 basis points. 
From a line of business perspective, Footwear and Home were the strongest categories for both the quarter and the year. Accessories was the weakest category in both periods. On a regional basis, the West region was the strongest for both the quarter and the year, while the Mid-Atlantic and South Central were the most difficult regions. 
Gross margin was challenging for the quarter, down approximately 80 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher promotional markdowns during the holiday season as well as an increase in shipping costs versus last year, driven by our 30% increase in digital orders. The effect of the increased penetration of the national brand was as expected, as penetration grew to 58% for the quarter and 52% in the year. The growth in penetration was similar for both the quarter and the year. 
Gross margin was flat for the first 3 quarters of the year. However, gross margin for the year decreased 27 basis points to 36.1% of sales due to the fourth quarter performance, which was lower than our guidance for the year of flat to up 20 basis points. 
SG&A dollars increased $60 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleverage 80 basis points. As expected, marketing expenses deleveraged as we invested heavily to drive sales. Many of those expenditures will not be repeated in 2016. 
Store payroll also deleveraged due to ongoing wage pressure and omni-channel support and Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. 
During the fourth quarter, almost 30% of our digital sales units were either shipped from or picked up in our stores, more than 2x last year's penetration rate. BFCs and IT also deleveraged. Store expenses, distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores, corporate and credit all leveraged. 
For the year, SG&A expenses were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% over 2014, which was consistent with our guidance of 1.5% to 2.5% increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 30 basis points. Store payroll, corporate, e-commerce, fulfillment centers and IT deleveraged for the year, while marketing, credit and distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores all leveraged. 
Depreciation expense was $239 million for the quarter. For the year, depreciation was $934 million, generally in line with our guidance of $940 million. Depreciation increased in both periods, primarily due to  higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter and decreased $13 million to $327 million for the year. As a reminder, our original guidance was $335 million. The decreases are due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing earlier in the year. 
Our income tax rate was 35.9% for the quarter and 36.3% for the year. The tax rate increased 60 basis points during both periods as the prior year periods included some favorable tax audit settlements. This was versus our guidance of 37% for the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, net income was $296 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.58. Excluding $169 million of debt extinguishment losses that we recorded earlier in the year, net income was $781 million for the year and diluted EPS was $4.01. We recently closed 2 stores, one in Texas and other in California. We currently operate 1,164 stores. Gross square footage is 100.4 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.8 million square feet. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $707 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately half of last year's balance. Higher inventory, lower payables and payment of the debt premium in cash contributed to the decrease. 
Inventory dollars per store were 5.7% higher than year-end 2014. Units per store were up 5% higher than the end of last year. The increases are primarily within national brands, which are up more than 10% over last year. We expect inventory to be down low single digits at the end of the first quarter and down mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
AP as a percent of inventory decreased 865 basis points to 31%. Almost half of the increase -- excuse me, half of the decrease is due to the anniversary of last year's port strike. Lower year-over-year January receipts and higher inventory levels also contributed to the decrease. 
Our capital expenditures were $690 million for the year, approximately $100 million lower than our original expectations. IT spending was approximately $300 million, which was $50 million lower than expectations, as we are buying our registers closer to installing our new point-of-sale system. 
Store experience and refresh spending, which includes beauty, remodels, new stores and general store upkeep was $250 million, about $50 million lower than our original plans as we reduced the number of stores we are remodeling and revised our in-store merchandising plans. Base capital spending of approximately $150 million was generally consistent with our original plans. 
We expect capital expenditures of $825 million in 2016, approximately $135 million higher than 2015. About $60 million of the increase was related to a timing chip in IT, mainly due to our registered purchase for those -- for that new point-of-sale system this year. 
In addition, we are accelerating construction with fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, with construction beginning in 2016 with the goal to open in time for fall 2017. 
CapEx is expected to include $375 million for IT spending; $250 million for store strategies, including new stores, remodels, beauty and easy experience initiatives and new brand rollouts; and $200 million in base capital, including investment and the e-fulfillment center. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 187 million for the quarter and 195 million for the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our stock, bringing our total for the year to 17.4 million shares repurchased. We ended the year with 187 million shares of stock outstanding. 
On Wednesday, our board approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. The $0.50 dividend is payable on March 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

I want to take a few comments regarding 2015 results [indiscernible]. This past 2015 [indiscernible] results came on top with very strong holiday performance last year, and we're our fifth consecutive quarter of positive sales increases since the launch of the Greatness Agenda. During the most competitive period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we achieved a 4% sales increase with customers definitely choosing Kohl's. It's clear to us that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is working, and we're making progress towards our goal being the most engaging retailer in America. We've seen great success in many of the major initiatives engineered under our plan. And our focus on product initiatives, we've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio and have seen double-digit increases in sales of most national brands. We've put our stake in the ground to be destination for active and wellness and have dramatically increased our share of this growing category, positioning us for success in the future. 
We made 5 big investments for holiday: active and wellness, premium electronics, beauty, license entertainment and team apparel. And in total, we achieved our plan for the fourth quarter for these investments and achieved a double-digit sales increase combined. 
And finally, our localization efforts are proving out, and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store portfolio. This means we'll be both improving the in-store experience for the customer and very importantly, better managing our inventory across the company. 
And our focus around omni-channel initiatives, we're seeing the results on our multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in digital technology with online demand driving sales. Online-generated demand was up 25% for the year and 30% for the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, much of that demand was fulfilled with best-in-class Ship from Store enablement and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capability. Both of these capabilities will create more opportunity for future growth, provide a greater customer experience and leverage our store portfolio in a meaningful way. 
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 11 million customers and growing and new mobile in-store capabilities, including mobile pay, were successful as well. Our digital and mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards program has quickly become an industry-leading loyalty program, and we now have the opportunity to cultivate that membership base and increase our share of wallet from them by giving them more relevant and more personal experiences that draw them into the brand and back into the store. 
Moving on and looking forward, I want to provide an update on the Greatness Agenda, organization and stores. While I'm happy with the progress we've made on many of our key initiatives, we were very clear in the expected outcomes of the Greatness Agenda. By 2017, we have targeted 3 outcomes: 90th percentile on associate engagement, best-in-class customer engagement and $21 billion in sales. I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made on the first 2 outcomes, but we are right where we need to be to achieving those 2 goals. But for many reasons, including a difficult macroeconomic and retail environment, it's unlikely we'll achieve our sales goal on the time line we originally set. But I do believe we'll achieve that goal within a short time after. 
It's clear though that we need to move with greater speed and agility, accelerate plan changes in our business model more quickly and focus our resources in the most productive assets and projects, while moving away from those that are not delivering results. We need to embrace the evolving behaviors of our customers and take actions to support the long-term health and success of our business. We began those efforts recently by realigning our organization and leadership in buying and planning, store environment and design and digital and infrastructure technology. We changed the scope of some of our leaders and teams, reorganized some functions and brought key teams under shared leaders. The purpose of those changes was to enable efficiency and decision-making, leverage our biggest asset, our inventory more effectively and deploy capital resources more clearly around investments to drive both sales and profitability. Most importantly, there were targeted to increase our ability to respond with more speed to our customer.
As you likely read in our press release this morning, we're announcing several updates to our store portfolio and omni-channel strategy. We will be piloting 7 new small format stores, approximately 35,000 square foot in size that will open this year, which will help both inform future stores size and rationalization and identify omni-channel opportunities as well. We'll also continue our Off-Aisle pilot with 2 new stores and open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space. In addition, we'll close 18 underperforming stores, which represent less than 1% of our total sales. We expect to announce the specific store locations by the end of March. 
The closures are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $10 million. As a result of both the store closures and the organizational realignment, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $170 million in charges that will be recognized in the first and second quarter of 2016. 
I'm very happy to say that every affected Kohl's stores associate will be offered the opportunity to work in a nearby Kohl's store location or if they prefer a competitive severance package. These organizational store changes are a good example of how we intend to capture more expense savings, an effort which will be an important part of how we reached our sales goals and increased profitability at the same time. While I believe most investors give us high marks for expense management, we know we need to do better. Traditionally, our goal has been to leverage our expenses assuming we achieve a 2% sales increase. And despite the fact that we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omni-channel initiatives, we're moving to lower our leverage point to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. 
The blueprint for that effort will be a plan to reimagine all of our decision-making processes and better utilize our previous investment in technology to do so. I've challenged all of our teams to explore ways that will find more efficiency in our work and focus on speed in reaching our goals. 
Although we've made progress in both our marketing spend and speed, we believe there are opportunities in that area of our cost structure as part of this effort as well. Our associates have wholeheartedly embraced the Greatness Agenda, and we've seen an evolution in the way we work together. By empowering our teams against the goal of greater speed and giving them the space they need to work in, in a more streamlined way, I believe we'll continue to develop ways to do more with less, something Kohl's has always been known for. 
The other area of opportunity I want to discuss is the work being done around lowering the level of our inventory. This is especially critical in allowing our stores to be more efficient, lower our cost and deliver a better customer experience at the same time. Since 2011, our average inventory per store has grown approximately 15%. While some of this was funded to add inventory for the digital portion of our business and to aid in our national brand initiatives, we're committed to manage it more intelligently. 
Key areas of focus will be around effective implementation of our localization initiative, leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand picked up in store and gaining efficiency in buying and planning through our recent reorganization. I expect that we can reduce our inventory per store by 10% by 2017. In the more near-term, we expect to enter this fall season with inventory per store down mid-single digits. 
Finally, I also want to ensure you that we are committed to invest in the long-term health of our business. We'll also continue to be good stewards of our capital. As you saw in our press release, our board has approved an 11% increase in our dividend, and we intend to continue our share buyback plan. 
I'll now turn it back to Wes to give you our guidance for fiscal 2016."

We would expect earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.25 for fiscal 2016. The guidance is based upon the following assumptions: Comp sales of flat to up 1%; total sales down 50 basis points to up 50 basis points, this includes the effect of the loss sales from the closed stores in 2016. However, we would expect to retain some of these sales in nearby stores and through the digital channel. Gross margin rate performance of flat to up 20 basis points. We would expect to have significant pressure in the first quarter of approximately 150 basis points drop versus last year, as we continue to aggressively clear excess merchandise. We would expect to see improvement in each of the remaining quarters as our inventory levels dropped below last year and become sequentially better throughout the year with the biggest improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
SG&A dollar increase of 1% to 2%. Our expectations for first quarter SG&A dollar growth would be 3% to 4%, as we have shifted the timing of our advertising expenses and it's more weighted to the first quarter this year. 
Depreciation expense of $940 million. The SG&A and depreciation guidance includes the partial year savings from the store closures in 2016. Interest expense of $310 million. Tax rate of 37%. This guidance also assumes share repurchases of $600 million at an average price of $50 per share. 
We would expect these costs in PP&E write-offs related to store closures and severance associated with the store closures and corporate reorganization to be approximately $150 million to $170 million with $55 million to $65 million of this charge included in Q1. The earnings guidance I just gave excludes any of this impact as these are just estimates at this time. 
And with that, we'll open the call to questions."

We'll complete that in the spring. We'll have all the stores done by the end of the second quarter, a little earlier than we did this year. So we feel very good about that. We're also saving money on a lot of the investment in the stores. We've cut investment about -- in half because we saw the same lift in modified, a little bit less expensive version as we did in the earlier version. From a loyalty perspective, we really anniversary that in October. We didn't expect to see any lift when we built the plan to the goal we shared with you guys last October -- I guess, October of '14. We didn't really count any lift from that. They continue to spend a lot more money than non-loyalty members, obviously that's self-selecting. But even in like-for-like, we're still seeing a lift. We feel very good about the loyalty program. The focus really in 2016 is to move them along the value chain, so try to get them to spend more money at Kohl's as loyalty members. And then we're working behind the scenes as we roll out our new point-of-sale system in the fall to do a better job of being able to prescreen those folks behind the scenes to preapprove them for a Kohl's credit card and then explain the great additional value they get with that. So that will be more of the focus as we move into '16 and '17, not so much trying to sign up more loyalty members, although that's certainly a goal. But trying to move them into being more loyal customers if -- through spending more in loyalty or eventually moving them to a Kohl's credit card customer."

So we took a really critical look at every single one of our markets and try to make a determination of where we had significant store overlap in a trade area that we were not generating incremental sales in and stores that perhaps were being impacted more by our omni-channel initiatives, and obviously, also involved derivative costs review. And so stores that we really didn't see the future potential to generate profitability in because of, let's say, a very high rent expense came under review as well. I think that we're going to learn a lot. I mean, I think, fundamentally, the answer to the question you had about additional store closures is we really don't know.

And so nothing new is happening there. That's been that way for as long as I've been involved at Kohl's, and I suspect we'll continue to be that way.

I mean, that is going to be the driver, whether it's the application of our Yes2You Reward loyalty program to improve, as Wes covered both total sales with  those customers, but also a conversion over time to consider credit card as a reasonable alternative as well or it's just making the spend that we have around personalization more effective regardless of whether that's print or direct mail or the utilization of our app. So we've set goals for ourselves, and we definitely think that it's an important part.

What that means, we think, is that we'll do a better job of inventory management as a result. So I think one way we're looking at this is inventory management more effectively, and that will include using the inventories we have in our stores to fulfill online orders.

As you know, one that you called out was our active and wellness category, which was extremely successful. And I continue to see growth there, and we are still expecting to grow the business. But we also know that we need to have a good balance. And so what we've been working on, Paul, is to really reimagine and change the way we go about delivering our private and exclusive brands with an eye towards increased speed and shortened delivery times, because we know that that's the only way we're going to get really long-term improvement there. We're also targeting each of our -- particularly large private brands for relaunches, and we're starting naturally with the biggest-single private brand we have, which is SONOMA. And SONOMA will be relaunched as a brand this year, and we do expect that, that's going to rejuvenate that business a meaningful way. So we're -- I think, we're happy with the balance. We're not backing away at all on our intensity around national brands. We still believe that that's really critical for us to continue to both support the once we have, whether they are big brands like Levi's and Denim or Nike and active, but also add new brands. So we're definitely focused on both omni-channel and stores consideration of where we could improve our brand portfolio."

And as we both have alluded to, utilizing the growth in online demand, the embracing the customers have done around our digital platform more effectively by leveraging our store base and our store inventory is really the critical component that we need to improve on. And that has a lot of elements to it that we're focused on, everything from leveraging the inventory to improving the effectiveness in which we fulfill the orders. And as Wes pointed out, making technology drive better decisions in terms of where orders are fulfilled across the platform. So our focus is definitely on our existing store platform. But having said that, we don't want to back down from looking at new ideas that might enhance the future for Kohl's. So I still believe that 35,000 square foot pilot stores that we're launching could be long term, really important for us, because they are not to the fact that more and more of our business is being online. And while it's fulfilled in store either through Ship from Store or Pick Up In Store, that customer is starting how -- online. And if we can find a way to have smaller stores that are effective and still provide that platform, it just gives us a great opportunity as we look down the road in a few years."

On the reorganization, there is component parts to it, right? I mean, the first and most important part is we recognize that while the structure we had was right for the time we had it, we need a different view looking forward that reflects the way that customer looks at our business, and the customer looks at our business through 1 lens. It's seamless. It's omni-channel. And therefore, that's how we have to make our decisions. And so the buying and planning decisions that we'll make will be predicated on one view, and that's the customers' view. So that's got opportunity for us because I think it will make us more sensitive to assortment sizes, it will make us more sensitive to leveraging the inventory that we have in our existing brick-and-mortar organization. The second though really important component, which you hit on is really speed. And we probably would say that the biggest opportunity we have on speed is naturally inside our private and exclusive brand organization. Half of our business, we work on longer lead times generally, and we've had success in some areas. Juniors is a great example of really driving down that cycle time and getting better top line results and more effective inventory turnover. And so employing some of those ideas into our other business is what we're focused on, on now. And I wouldn't want to go through with each and every brand and what the lead time is today and what our goals are. And to be frank with you, in each and every brand, we probably don't have a complete clear vision on that. But we definitely won't bring it way way down.

So I think what's driving the private stronger language about the critical nature of personalization to improving sales productivity on our advertising expense is we now have a pretty long track record of the testing and the piloting. We have to convert that now. We have to scale it, and we have to apply it to every single platform we have because that, to us, is going to be the long-term success. It's not that -- unlike to localization, initiative is important to our inventory management. While we know we've got to drive down inventory per store and utilize our store inventory to help fulfill this growing online demand, we also know the most important thing we have to do is provide more localized assortments that are more attractive to the customers in the trade areas in which the store sits.

We're seeing the wage pressure, we're not immune to it. Other people have reported, they said it's a pressure in this quarter, it's going to be a pressure this year. It's more than 1/3 of our overall SG&A. So that's going up, and we can be more efficient. Like I mentioned in Ship from Store and BOPUS, that will help mitigate that. We actually experienced health care deflation this year. We had a tremendous year in terms of that. Knock on, well, we were lucky we didn't have a ton of large claims, which can really swing it one way or the other, but we've made a lot of plan changes and wellness initiatives. We have a relatively young population that helps as well. But we're going to cut advertising. We -- I think Bob asked, we spent $1.11 billion this year. We wanted to spend $1 billion. The goal is to spend $1 billion this year, so maybe we'll spend even a little bit less than that. We can get more efficient in the e-commerce fulfillment centers, and we're going to get more efficient in corporate with the reorganization that we had. We have to be smarter about when positions open up, not filling them. And just increasing speed across the organization, I think that will be a big help. But those are kind of the buckets we're going to try to do to offset. IT expenses are also going to go up. I mean, we're spending a bunch of money in IT. So IT in stores are going to come. Everything else, pretty much have to go down somehow."

This is not something we're starting last week. We've been working on reducing those forward-looking expenses. And one of the things that's going to be a big component part of that, that we sort of alluded to, but I think, honestly, has a big impact, is lower inventory level. Lower inventory level is less material handling, is less distribution expense, it's significantly less workload in the store, and that has a big impact in a positive way on store payroll. So our average hourly wage is going up, but if we're putting a lot less inventory in the store, there's a lot less work to do and the store is part to handle it."

As we announced earlier this month, comp sales increased 40 basis points for the quarter. Though we were pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps, sales were volatile during the quarter and were below our expectations. 
Holiday sales, which include the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, increased 4%, and store traffic was 400 basis points better than industry average. This strength, however, was substantially offset by softness in early November and in January, when demand for cold weather goods was especially low. 
For the year, comp sales increased 70 basis points. Looking at the metrics of the comp, the components of the comp for the 40 basis point increase in the fourth quarter were as follows: Transactions per store increased 20 basis points for the quarter; average transaction value also increased 20 basis points, comprised of an average unit retail increase of 30 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 10 basis points. 
The components of the 70 basis comp increase for fiscal 2015 were as follows: Transactions per store decreased 20 basis points for the year; average transaction value increased 90 basis points, comprised of an average unit retail increase of 130 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 40 basis points. 
From a line of business perspective, footwear and home were the strongest categories for both the quarter and the year. Accessories was the weakest category in both periods. On a regional basis, the West region was the strongest for both the quarter and the year, while the Mid-Atlantic and South Central were the most difficult regions. 
Gross margin was challenging for the quarter, down approximately 80 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher promotional markdowns during the holiday season as well as an increase in shipping costs versus last year, driven by our 30% increase in digital orders. The effect of the increased penetration of the national brand was as expected, as penetration grew to 58% for the quarter and 52% in the year. The growth in penetration was similar for both the quarter and the year. 
Gross margin was flat for the first 3 quarters of the year. However, gross margin for the year decreased 27 basis points to 36.1% of sales due to the fourth quarter performance, which was lower than our guidance for the year of flat to up 20 basis points. 
SG&A dollars increased $60 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 80 basis points. As expected, marketing expenses deleveraged as we invested heavily to drive sales. Many of those expenditures will not be repeated in 2016. 
Store payroll also deleveraged due to ongoing wage pressure and omni-channel support in Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. 
During the fourth quarter, almost 30% of our digital sales units were either shipped from or picked up in our stores, more than 2x last year's penetration rate. EFCs and IT also deleveraged. Store expenses, distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores, corporate and credit all leveraged. 
For the year, SG&A expenses were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% over 2014, which was consistent with our guidance of a 1.5% to 2.5% increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 30 basis points. Store payroll, corporate, e-commerce, fulfillment centers and IT deleveraged for the year, while marketing, credit and distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores all leveraged. 
Depreciation expense was $239 million for the quarter. For the year, depreciation was $934 million, generally in line with our guidance of $940 million. Depreciation increased in both periods, primarily due to  higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter and decreased $13 million to $327 million for the year. As a reminder, our original guidance was $335 million. The decreases are due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing earlier in the year. 
Our income tax rate was 35.9% for the quarter and 36.3% for the year. The tax rate increased 60 basis points during both periods as the prior year periods included some favorable tax audit settlements. This was versus our guidance of 37% for the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, net income was $296 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.58. Excluding $169 million of debt extinguishment losses that we recorded earlier in the year, net income was $781 million for the year and diluted EPS was $4.01. We recently closed 2 stores, one in Texas and the other in California. We currently operate 1,164 stores. Gross square footage is 100.4 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.8 million square feet. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $707 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately half of last year's balance. Higher inventory, lower payables and payment of the debt premium in cash contributed to the decrease. 
Inventory dollars per store were 5.7% higher than year-end 2014. Units per store were up 5% higher than the end of last year. The increases are primarily within national brands, which are up more than 10% over last year. We expect inventory to be down low single digits at the end of the first quarter and down mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
AP as a percent of inventory decreased 865 basis points to 31%. Almost half of the increase -- excuse me, half of the decrease is due to the anniversary of last year's port strike. Lower year-over-year January receipts and higher inventory levels also contributed to the decrease. 
Our capital expenditures were $690 million for the year, approximately $100 million lower than our original expectations. IT spending was approximately $300 million, which was $50 million lower than expectations, as we are buying our registers closer to installing our new point-of-sale system. 
Store experience and refresh spending, which includes beauty, remodels, new stores and general store upkeep, was $250 million, about $50 million lower than our original plans, as we reduced the number of stores we are remodeling and revised our in-store merchandising plans. Base capital spending of approximately $150 million was generally consistent with our original plans. 
We expect capital expenditures of $825 million in 2016, approximately $135 million higher than 2015. About $60 million of the increase was related to a timing shift in IT, mainly due to our register purchase for those -- for that new point-of-sale system this year. 
In addition, we are accelerating construction of a fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, with construction beginning in 2016 with the goal to open in time for fall 2017. 
CapEx is expected to include $375 million for IT spending; $250 million for store strategies, including new stores, remodels, beauty and easy experience initiatives and new brand rollouts; and $200 million in base capital, including investment in the e-fulfillment center. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 187 million for the quarter and 195 million for the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our stock, bringing our total for the year to 17.4 million shares repurchased. We ended the year with 187 million shares of stock outstanding. 
On Wednesday, our board approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. The $0.50 dividend is payable on March 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

This past 2015 quarter's results came on top of very strong holiday performance last year, and were our fifth consecutive quarter of positive sales increas",1417,"Thanks, Wes. I want to take a minute to make a few comments regarding 2015 results [indiscernible]. This past 2015 quarter's results came on top of very strong holiday performance last year, and were our fifth consecutive quarter of positive sales increases since the launch of the Greatness Agenda. During the most competitive period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we achieved a 4% sales increase, with customers definitely choosing Kohl's. It's clear to us that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is working, and we're making progress towards our goal of being the most engaging retailer in America. We've seen great success in many of the major initiatives engineered under our plan. In our focus on product initiatives, we've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio and have seen double-digit increases in sales of most national brands. We've put our stake in the ground to be the destination for active and wellness and have dramatically increased our share of this growing category, positioning us for success in the future. 
We made 5 big investments for holiday: active and wellness, premium electronics, beauty, licensed entertainment and team apparel. And in total, we achieved our plan for the fourth quarter for these investments and achieved a double-digit sales increase combined. 
And finally, our localization efforts are proving out, and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store portfolio. This means we'll be both improving the in-store experience for the customer and very importantly, better managing our inventory across the company. 
In our focus around omni-channel initiatives, we're seeing the results on our multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in digital technology, with online demand driving sales. Online-generated demand was up 25% for the year and 30% for the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, much of that demand was fulfilled with best-in-class Ship from Store enablement and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capability. Both of these capabilities will create more opportunity for future growth, provide a greater customer experience and leverage our store portfolio in a meaningful way. 
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 11 million customers and growing, and new mobile in-store capabilities, including mobile pay, were successful as well. Our digital and mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards program has quickly become an industry-leading loyalty program, and we now have the opportunity to cultivate that membership base and increase our share of wallet from them by giving them more relevant and more personal experiences that draw them into the brand and back into the store. 
Moving on to looking forward, I want to provide an update on the Greatness Agenda, our organization and stores. While I'm happy with the progress we've made on many of our key initiatives, we were very clear in the expected outcomes of the Greatness Agenda. By 2017, we have targeted 3 outcomes: 90th percentile on associate engagement, best-in-class customer engagement and $21 billion in sales. I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made on the first 2 outcomes, and we are right where we need to be to achieving those 2 goals. But for many reasons, including a difficult macroeconomic and retail environment, it's unlikely we'll achieve our sales goal on the time line we originally set. But I do believe we'll achieve that goal within a short time after. 
It's clear, though, that we need to move with greater speed and agility, accelerate plan changes in our business model more quickly and focus our resources on the most productive assets and projects, while moving away from those that are not delivering results. We need to embrace the evolving behaviors of our customers and take actions to support the long-term health and success of our business. We began those efforts recently by realigning our organization and leadership in buying and planning, store environment and design and digital and infrastructure technology. We changed the scope of some of our leaders and teams, reorganized some functions and brought key teams under shared leaders. The purpose of those changes was to enable efficiency and decision-making, leverage our biggest asset, our inventory, more effectively and deploy capital resources more clearly around investments that drive both sales and profitability. Most importantly, they were targeted to increase our ability to respond with more speed to our customer.
As you likely read in our press release this morning, we're announcing several updates to our store portfolio and omni-channel strategy. We will be piloting 7 new small format stores, approximately 35,000 square foot in size, that will open this year, which will help both inform future store size and rationalization and identify omni-channel opportunities as well. We'll also continue our Off-Aisle pilot with 2 new stores and open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space. In addition, we'll close 18 underperforming stores, which represent less than 1% of our total sales. We expect to announce the specific store locations by the end of March. 
The closures are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $10 million. As a result of both the store closures and the organizational realignment, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $170 million in charges that will be recognized in the first and second quarter of 2016. 
I'm very happy to say that every affected Kohl's store associate will be offered the opportunity to work in a nearby Kohl's store location, or if they prefer, a competitive severance package. These organizational and store changes are a good example of how we intend to capture more expense savings, an effort which will be an important part of how we reach our sales goals and increase profitability at the same time. While I believe most investors give us high marks for expense management, we know we need to do better. Traditionally, our goal has been to leverage our expenses assuming we achieve a 2% sales increase. And despite the fact that we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omni-channel initiatives, we're moving to lower our leverage point to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. 
The blueprint for that effort will be a plan to reimagine all of our decision-making processes and better utilize our previous investment in technology to do so. I've challenged all of our teams to explore ways that will find more efficiency in our work and focus on speed in reaching our goals. 
Although we've made progress in both our marketing spend and speed, we believe there are opportunities in that area of our cost structure as part of this effort as well. Our associates have wholeheartedly embraced the Greatness Agenda, and we've seen an evolution in the way we work together. By empowering our teams against the goal of greater speed and giving them the space they need to work in, in a more streamlined way, I believe we'll continue to develop ways to do more with less, something Kohl's has always been known for. 
The other area of opportunity I want to discuss is the work being done around lowering the level of our inventory. This is especially critical in allowing our stores to be more efficient, lower our cost and deliver a better customer experience at the same time. Since 2011, our average inventory per store has grown approximately 15%. While some of this was funded to add inventory for the digital portion of our business and to aid in our national brand initiatives, we're committed to manage it more intelligently. 
Key areas of focus will be around effective implementation of our localization initiative, leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand picked up in store and gaining efficiency in buying and planning through our recent reorganization. I expect that we can reduce our inventory per store by 10% by 2017. In the more near term, we expect to enter this fall season with inventory per store down mid-single digits. 
Finally, I also want to ensure you that while we are committed to investing in the long-term health of our business, we'll also continue to be good stewards of our capital. As you saw in our press release, our board has approved an 11% increase in our dividend, and we intend to continue our share buyback plan. 
I'll now turn it back to Wes to give you our guidance for fiscal 2016."

We would expect earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.25 for fiscal 2016. The guidance is based upon the following assumptions: Comp sales of flat to up 1%; total sales down 50 basis points to up 50 basis points, this includes the effect of the lost sales from the closed stores in 2016. However, we would expect to retain some of these sales in nearby stores and through the digital channel. Gross margin rate performance of flat to up 20 basis points. We would expect to have significant pressure in the first quarter of approximately 150 basis points drop versus last year, as we continue to aggressively clear excess merchandise. We would expect to see improvement in each of the remaining quarters as our inventory levels drop below last year and become sequentially better throughout the year, with the biggest improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
SG&A dollar increase of 1% to 2%. Our expectations for first quarter SG&A dollar growth would be 3% to 4%, as we have shifted the timing of our advertising expenses and it's more weighted to the first quarter this year. 
Depreciation expense of $940 million. The SG&A and depreciation guidance includes the partial year savings from the store closures in 2016. Interest expense of $310 million. Tax rate of 37%. This guidance also assumes share repurchases of $600 million at an average price of $50 per share. 
We would expect lease costs and PP&E write-offs related to store closures and severance associated with the store closures and corporate reorganization to be approximately $150 million to $170 million, with $55 million to $65 million of this charge included in Q1. The earnings guidance I just gave excludes any of this impact, as these are just estimates at this time. 
And with that, we'll open the call to questions."

We'll complete that in the spring. We'll have all the stores done by the end of the second quarter, a little earlier than we did this year. So we feel very good about that. We're also saving money on a lot of the investment in the stores. We've cut the investment about in half because we saw the same lift in the modified, a little bit less expensive version as we did in the earlier version. From a loyalty perspective, we really anniversary that in October. We didn't expect to see any lift when we built the plan to the goal we shared with you guys last October -- I guess, October of '14. We didn't really count on any lift from that. They continue to spend a lot more money than non-loyalty members, obviously that's self-selecting. But even in like-for-like, we're still seeing a lift. So we feel very good about the loyalty program. The focus really in 2016 is to move them along the value chain, so try to get them to spend more money at Kohl's as loyalty members. And then we're working behind the scenes, as we roll out our new point-of-sale system in the fall, to do a better job of being able to prescreen those folks behind the scenes to preapprove them for a Kohl's credit card and explain the great additional value they get with that. So that will be more of the focus as we move into '16 and '17, not so much trying to sign up more loyalty members, although that's certainly a goal, but trying to move them into being more loyal customers, is through spending more on loyalty or eventually moving them to a Kohl's credit card customer."

And it does involve multiple markets as well. And the process that we went through to determine that certainly involved looking at the total sales in the store and the momentum in the sales in the store, because that's pretty critical, is the store treading water or headed down. Second most importantly, probably, the market view. So we took a really critical look at every single one of our markets and tried to make a determination of where we had significant store overlap in a trade area that we were not generating incremental sales in and stores that perhaps were being impacted more by our omni-channel initiatives, and obviously, also involved in it is cost review. And so stores that we really didn't see the future potential to generate profitability in, because of, let's say, a very high rent expense, came under review as well. I think that we're going to learn a lot. I mean, I think fundamentally, the answer to the question you had about additional store closures is we really don't know. I think we'll watch what happens with this process through the fall and holiday season, and we'll make another assessment as we come out of this year to make a better determination of what the right portfolio really looks like.

We've taken that obligation on for many, many years. I've been on the board for more than 15 years, and it's a constant review with advisers to look at, do we have the right store portfolio, are we making the right investments, is the capital allocation decision-making that we are employing sound and are there alternatives to that, that we could consider. And so nothing new is happening there. That's been that way for as long as I've been involved at Kohl's, and I suspect will continue to be that way. So I don't think there's a hey, would it be better for us to be public, or would it be better for us to be private.

And so on the positive side, marketing leveraged. We actually reduced our marketing spend, which is something, long term, we intend to continue to do. On the negative side, I think our expectations at the beginning of the year were more optimistic than we ended up. Marketing is definitely a component part of the areas that we're looking to reduce expenses in over the course of the future years. And frankly, the key unlock there, we really believe, is personalization. I mean, that is going to be the driver, whether it's the application of our Yes2You Reward loyalty program to improve, as Wes covered, both total sales with those customers, but also a conversion over time to consider our credit card as a reasonable alternative as well, or it's just making the spend that we have around personalization more effective, regardless of whether that's print or direct mail or the utilization of our app. So we've set goals for ourselves, and we definitely think that it's an important part.

And while at the time that we built a separate e-com team it made sense for us, because it was a small but growing business. Today, it's a very big business. But most importantly, from a customer's perspective, she sees this through one lens. So we know that we need one view of the customer and the way to achieve that is through one organization long term. What that means, we think, is that we'll do a better job of inventory management as a result. So I think one way we're looking at this is inventory management more effectively, and that will include using the inventories we have in our stores to fulfill online orders. That was very successful all year last year and it peaked in a dramatic way in the fourth quarter, and we suspect that will continue to be a big tool to both improved inventory leverage, but also make us more efficient. The other piece that we know we have to find a better long-term solution to is around fulfillment costs, and that's critical for us. And so we are investing.

And as we both have alluded to, utilizing the growth in online demand, the embracing that customers have done around our digital platform, more effectively by leveraging our store base and our store inventory is really the critical component that we need to improve on. And that has a lot of elements to it that we're focused on, everything from leveraging the inventory to improving the effectiveness in which we fulfill the orders. And as Wes pointed out, making technology drive better decisions in terms of where orders are fulfilled across the platform. So our focus is definitely on our existing store platform. But having said that, we don't want to back down from looking at new ideas that might enhance the future for Kohl's. So I still believe that the 35,000 square foot pilot stores that we're launching could be long term, really important for us, because they are a nod to the fact that more and more of our business is being online. And while it's fulfilled in store, either through Ship from Store or Pick Up In Store, that customer is starting out online. And if we can find a way to have smaller stores that are effective and still provide that platform, it just gives us a great opportunity as we look down the road in a few years."

I mean, the first and most important part is we recognize that while the structure we had was right for the time we had it, we need a different view looking forward that reflects the way the customer looks at our business, and the customer looks at our business through one lens. It's seamless. It's omni-channel. And therefore, that's how we have to make our decisions. And so the buying and planning decisions that we'll make will be predicated on one view, and that's the customers' view. So that's got opportunity for us because I think it will make us more sensitive to assortment sizes, it will make us more sensitive to leveraging the inventory that we have in our existing brick-and-mortar organization. The second, though, really important component which you hit on is really speed. And we probably would say that the biggest opportunity we have on speed is naturally inside our private and exclusive brand organization. It's half of our business, we work on longer lead times generally, and we've had success in some areas. Juniors is a great example of really driving down that cycle time and getting better top line results and more effective inventory turnover. And so employing some of those ideas into our other business is what we're focused on, on now. And I wouldn't want to go through with each and every brand and what the lead time is today and what our goals are, and to be frank with you, in each and every brand, we probably don't have a completely clear vision on that. But we definitely want to bring it way, way down. So I think on the speed initiative, it's probably more about the private and exclusive brands."

It's a good thing to do around Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, for last-minute kind of things as people pick up gifts for that. So I think we'll learn more throughout the year now that the capability is well understood and well launched for us. And then all of the traffic really came from mobile, the increases this year. You're right, I think that's where it's going to come from. I think I'm most proud of the fact that our overall conversion rate for the year approached 4% for all devices, but our conversion rate on the phone, which is a lot lower than desktop and tablet, improved 59%. So our investments in improving the app especially was definitely well received by the customer. I think Kevin mentioned there's 11 million downloads of our app and growing.

So I think what's driving the probably the stronger language about the critical nature of personalization to improving sales productivity on our advertising expense is we now have a pretty long track record of the testing and the piloting. We have to convert that now. We have to scale it, and we have to apply it to every single platform we have, because that, to us, is going to be the long-term success. It's not that unlike the localization initiatives important to our inventory management. While we know we've got to drive down inventory per store and utilize our store inventory to help fulfill this growing online demand, we also know the most important thing we have to do is provide more localized assortments that are more attractive to the customers in the trade areas in which the store sits. So personalization is the most important thing that we have as a tool to drive advertising expense down over time.

We're seeing the wage pressure, we're not immune to it. Other people have reported said it's a pressure in this quarter. It's going to be a pressure this year. It's more than 1/3 of our overall SG&A. So that's going up. And we can be more efficient, like I mentioned, in Ship from Store and BOPUS, that will help mitigate that. We actually experienced health care deflation this year. We had a tremendous year in terms of that. Knock on wood, we were lucky we didn't have a ton of large claims, which can really swing it one way or the other, but we've made a lot of plan changes and wellness initiatives. We have a relatively young population, that helps as well. But we're going to cut advertising. We -- I think Bob asked, we spent $1.11 billion this year. We want to spend $1 billion. The goal is to spend $1 billion this year, so maybe we'll spend even a little bit less than that. We can get more efficient in the e-commerce fulfillment centers, and we're going to get more efficient in corporate, with the reorganization that we had.

Lower inventory level is less material handling, is less distribution expense, it's significantly less workload in the store, and that has a big impact in a positive way on store payroll.

Comp sales decrease 3.9% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of 190 basis point increase in units per transaction and 100 basis points decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's and women's were the strongest categories and home was the weakest. On a regional basis, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest were the strongest. The West and South Central were the most difficult regions.
Gross margin decrease approximately 140 basis points for the quarter, about 10 basis points better than we guided to last quarter. Most of the margin decrease was due to Clarence markdowns, taken the clear excess merchandise. 
Our SG&A expenses decreased $8 million to $1 billion for the quarter. We effectively manage discretionary spending but we're you're not able to leverage expenses on a sales decrease. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 75 basis points.
Store payroll dollars were slightly higher than last year as we pulled back on staffing to align with sales but did not leverage. Marketing deleveraged on higher spending associated with our Academy Awards sponsorship and higher digital spending. IT expenses also deleveraged.
Partially offsetting these increases were higher credit income and lower corporate expenses. Our credit share of sales was 58.8%, up 81 basis points from last year. Logistics expenses were also less than last year.
Depreciation expense was $234 million. The $7 million increase over last year is primarily due to higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing last summer.
Our income tax rate was 37.6%. The tax rate increased approximately 230 basis points as last year's first quarter included some favorable tax -- state tax audit settlements that we didn't have this year.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $17 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.09. For the quarter, we reported $64 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced earlier this year. The charge includes $53 million of impairment charges on the 18 stores, which we closed later this year. The remaining $11 million is primarily termination benefits for employees impacted by the closures and restructuring.
We expect to incur an additional $105 million to $110 million next quarter, which is slightly higher than our original estimates as we have more store associates than expected due to termination packages over relocation to another stories. 
Substantially, all of next quarter's charge will be to record lease related liabilities for stores we are closing prior to lease termination.
Excluding the store closures and restructuring charges, net income was $58 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share. We opened 3 new stores during the quarter, including our first 2 smaller 35,000 square foot format pilot stores. We currently operate 1,167 stores.
Gross square footage is 100.6 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.9 million square feet. We also open 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee market. We ended quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $772 million from last year. 
Inventory dollars per store were 2% lower than the first quarter of 2015 consistent with our guidance of down low single-digits despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were essentially flat as increases in national brand were more than offset by decreases in private and exclusive brands. AP as a percent of inventory decreased 650 basis points to 32.9%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts.
We also received some benefit in Q1 and Q2 of last year due to earlier arrive in receipts related to conservative planning after the port disruption in fall 2014 and spring 2015. Receipt flow year-over-year should be normalized by the third quarter of 2016. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of last year. Weighted average diluted shares were 184 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 185 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on June 22 to shareholders of record on June 8. 
I'll note it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

Our sea",1048,"Thanks, Wes. The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our seasonal business has followed similar trajectory as a total company sales trend. 
A little more color on our sales. Men's and women's were better than the company with strength in active across both of those categories. Basic and dress clothing were relatively strong in man's but juniors and intimate were better in women's.
Kids, Accessories and shoes were similar to the company with relative strength in boys and girls, beauty and fine jewelry as well as kid's shoes. Home was below the company with bedding, luggage and seasonal being outperformance with the balance being more difficult.
We did do a good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate dropped 140 basis points versus our projection of 150 basis points of a drop due to better-than-planned promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 2%, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect to make progress on inventory throughout this year, and we're targeting end the second quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per-store basis. 
On the SG&A line, every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend slightly less than last year in dollars versus our expectations originally of a 3% to 4% planned increase.
The team has shown as you would B2B able to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda.
Now focus on product initiatives, our national brands in the first quarter we launched Stride Rite and kid's shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area. The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 19% comp in the quarter.
Our national brands in total were slightly positive on a comp basis but active and wellness leading the way with a mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a midteens comp in the quarter.
National brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter. We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their priority trend. 
During the quarter, we also launched read from regret and handbags as improving our Accessories assortment has been a goal for us and it's off to a very good start. 
Our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store fleet. As we enter the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is now localized. We saw modest lift in quarter 1 but would expect the effect of this to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods like second and third quarter where localized assortments should make a bigger impact.
In our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand with online generated demand achieving a midteens increase, as expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for our customer.
In the first quarter, Ship from Store was 15% of our online demand and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store was 3%. We believe we have a big opportunity there and we'll continue to test marketing that option throughout the year to make a top of mind in our customers for holiday.
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 12 million customers and growing. During the quarter, we added capability to use Apple Pay with our Kohl's Charge Card and our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program, becoming the first retailer to integrate its private-label charge card and loyalty program within Apple Pay. 
On a store update front, we opened 2 small format stores during the quarter and we have a lot of learnings already that we will incorporate into our fall plan openings. A big learning was to be flexible and our offerings as each trade area is unique due to the relatively small size of the trade areas and our smaller store size as well.
Localization we believe will be critical for our success in this initiative. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee area, 1 in the off-price center in 1 in a strip center. We're pleased to the initial results, and we'll monitor the effects on cannibalization, which we would expect be very small. And in late May we'll open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.
Moving on to expenses. I mentioned in the year-end call that we're beginning an effort to reduce our leverage point on expenses from a 2% comparable sales increase to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. Despite the fact we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, we feel more confident that we'll be able to achieve that goal.
I think, you can see that given our ability to manage expenses in the first quarter. We expect to find additional savings throughout the year that will allow us to achieve our expense goals. 
In conclusion, it was definitely a difficult start to 2016. It's hard to gauge how much of the sales shortfall is related to macroeconomic factors and how much is related to company-specific factors. We definitely focus on improving our sales but especially our traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. We're relooking in all of our marketing vehicle to see where we can drive more business to the stores as well as ensuring our value message is particularly strong. Definitely not satisfied with the results so far and we'll take action every top of mind with the families that we serve. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Our seasonal categories underperformed for sure but they didn't significantly underperformed. So I do think Wes is either put them at the very top. We put things on the top, I think, we mentioned there seems to be some more macro issues given performances of both ourselves and competition. There seems to be some change in consumer behavior in terms of traffic coming into our stores, maybe because of that. We definitely have opportunity in our marketing area to improve our effectiveness. As we've moved in our media mix to a more traditional hold mix to a much more future state. We're finding things that have haven't worked as well that are probably that have of course corrected in the near term to get a better result.

From an inventory perspective, I mean, one of the things that Michelle and the merchant and product development teams has been working very hard is increasing the incentives power receipts that are sourced faster. So one of the success stories has been our soul Brent we moved a lot more of the production to the 13 -- or 12 to 14 week lead time right in the order to get into the store. That's moved up from a percentage basis quite a bit. They comp midteens this quarter on a inventory reduction of a couple of 2%, same as the company. So we're trying to move more of our private and exclusive brands to that. Over the next couple of years, we want to move from 20% of that being sourced within that time frame to about 50% of our product. Some of the things don't to make much sense that are very cost sensitive and don't change a lot like men's cargo pants or a lot of the kids quote that you're looking for the absolute lowest price because that customer is so price sensitive. But many of our Lehmans Brent both in private and exclusive need to move more quickly to that fast fashion type of model and Michelle and the PT guys are driving very hard in doing that. So it's really the first example of that will do more of that as we will broadly or with brands like simply very, very well and Apartment 9 of moving into next year."

In the short term, you lower inventory, you lower expenses but you add marketing and drive value, that's what you do to change the trend of our business proactively. You can't wait and hope that things will get better and you have to sort of plan that things will continue this way and therefore, this way you do.

I am not too worried about the spell from that perspective we kind of guided to 15% to 20% increase in our 3-year plan, and we saw the biggest increase last year in the back half. And I suspect that will be the case this year to us people find it more convenient in the fourth quarter to shop online. From a store base perspective, we closed every store really that had negative incremental free cash flow that's how we look at it. We've enclosed a few stores that were slightly positive. We needed to get a base of stores that was significant enough to see what happens to both online business and surrounding sister stores when we closed stores as well as what happens when we close a couple of stories in 1 particular market. So we've only closed part of the this year and probably 5 or 6 stories in my 13 years here so we didn't really have enough data points. We have the run the numbers as we move throughout the year and obviously if comps don't improved, and the store still be more stores that people what to negative cash flow, and we'll look at that on an annual basis. But for the most part, we have stores that are very much generating cash flow. I don't think you're going to see us close a significant number of stores every year. I think 18 was sort of starting plan, I think, it would be a lot lower than that if we decided to close stores for this year, for example."

We are making a concerted effort in the back half after we rolled out a new point-of-sale system to use the loyalty information is they've completed their profile to do a prescreened on them for our credit card and try to get people to move along the value path from not having a loyalty card to having a rewards card and and hopefully getting than them sign up for our credit card.

Comp sales decrease 3.9% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of 190 basis point increase in units per transaction and 100 basis points decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's and women's were the strongest categories and home was the weakest. On a regional basis, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest were the strongest. The West and South Central were the most difficult regions.
Gross margin decreased approximately 140 basis points for the quarter, about 10 basis points better than we guided to last quarter. Most of the margin decrease was due to clearance markdowns, taken the clear excess merchandise.
Our SG&A expenses decreased $8 million to $1 billion for the quarter. We effectively managed discretionary spending, but we're not able to leverage expenses on sales decrease. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 75 basis points.
Store payroll dollars were slightly higher than last year as we pulled back on staffing to align with sales but did not leverage. Marketing deleveraged on higher spending associated with our Academy Awards sponsorship and higher digital spending. IT expenses also deleveraged.
Partially offsetting these increases were higher credit income and lower corporate expenses. Our credit share of sales was 58.8%, up 81 basis points from last year. Logistics expenses were also less than last year.
Depreciation expense was $234 million. The $7 million increase over last year is primarily due to higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing last summer.
Our income tax rate was 37.6%. The tax rate increased approximately 230 basis points as last year's first quarter included some favorable tax -- state tax audit settlements that we didn't have this year.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $17 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.09. For the quarter, we reported $64 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced earlier this year. The charge includes $53 million of impairment charges on the 18 stores, which we closed later this year. The remaining $11 million is primarily termination benefits for employees impacted by the closures and restructuring.
We expect to incur an additional $105 million to $110 million next quarter, which is slightly higher than our original estimates as we have more store associates than expected due to termination packages over relocation to another stories.
Substantially, all of next quarter's charge will be to record lease-related liabilities for stores we are closing prior to lease termination.
Excluding the store closures and restructuring charges, net income was $58 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share. We opened 3 new stores during the quarter, including our first 2 smaller 35,000 square foot format pilot stores. We currently operate 1,167 stores.
Gross square footage is 100.6 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.9 million square feet. We also open 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee market. We ended quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $772 million from last year. 
Inventory dollars per store were 2% lower than the first quarter of 2015 consistent with our guidance of down low single-digits despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were essentially flat as increases in national brand were more than offset by decreases in private and exclusive brands. AP as a percent of inventory decreased 650 basis points to 32.9%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts.
We also received some benefit in Q1 and Q2 of last year due to earlier-arriving receipts related to conservative planning after the port disruption in fall 2014 and spring 2015. Receipt flow year-over-year should be normalized by the third quarter of 2016. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of last year. Weighted average diluted shares were 184 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 185 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on June 22 to shareholders of record on June 8. 
I'll note it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

Our sea",1054,"Thanks, Wes. The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our seasonal business has followed the similar trajectory as the total company sales trend. 
A little more color on our sales. Men's and women's were better than the company with strength in active across both of those categories. Basic and dress clothing were relatively strong in men's but juniors and intimate were better in women's.
Kids, accessories and shoes were similar to the company with relative strength in boys and girls, beauty and fine jewelry as well as kid's shoes. Home was below the company with bedding, luggage and seasonal being outperformers with the balance being more difficult.
We did do a good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate dropped 140 basis points versus our projection of 150 basis points of a drop due to better-than-planned promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 2%, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect to make progress on inventory throughout this year. And we're targeting end the second quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per-store basis.
On the SG&A line, every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend slightly less than last year in dollars versus our expectations originally of a 3% to 4% planned increase.
The team has shown agility to be able to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda.
And our focus on product initiatives. Our national brands in the first quarter, we launched Stride Rite and kid's shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area. The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 19% comp in the quarter.
Our national brands in total were slightly positive on a comp basis but active and wellness leading the way with a mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a mid-teens comp in the quarter.
National brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter. We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their priority trend.
During the quarter, we also launched Reed from Reed Krakoff's and handbags as improving our Accessories assortment has been a goal for us and it's off to a very good start.
Our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store fleet. As we enter the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is now localized. We saw a modest lift in quarter 1 but would expect the effect of this to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods, like second and third quarter, where localized assortments should make a bigger impact.
In our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand with online generated demand achieving a mid-teens increase, as expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for our customer.
In the first quarter, Ship from Store was 15% of our online demand and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store was 3%. We believe we have a big opportunity there and we'll continue to test marketing that option throughout the year to make a top of mind in our customers for holiday.
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 12 million customers and growing. During the quarter, we added capability to use Apple Pay with our Kohl's Charge Card and our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program, becoming the first retailer to integrate its private-label charge card and loyalty program within Apple Pay.
On a store update front, we opened 2 small format stores during the quarter, and we have a lot of learnings already that we will incorporate into our fall plan openings. A big learning was you need to be flexible in our offerings as each trade area is unique due to the relatively small size of the trade areas and our smaller store size as well.
Localization we believe will be critical for our success in this initiative. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee area, one in the off-price center in one in a strip center. We're pleased to the initial results, and we'll monitor the effects on cannibalization, which we would expect be very small. And in late May, we'll open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.
Moving on to expenses. I mentioned in the year-end call that we're beginning an effort to reduce our leverage point on expenses from a 2% comparable sales increase to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. Despite the fact we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, we feel more confident that we'll be able to achieve that goal.
I think, you can see that given our ability to manage expenses in the first quarter. We expect to find additional savings throughout the year that will allow us to achieve our expense goals.
In conclusion, it was definitely a difficult start to 2016. It's hard to gauge how much of the sales shortfall is related to macroeconomic factors and how much is related to company-specific factors. We're definitely focused on improving our sales but especially, our traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. We're relooking in all of our marketing vehicle to see where we can drive more business to the stores as well as ensuring our value message is particularly strong. Definitely not satisfied with the results so far, and we'll take -- action remain top of mind with the families that we serve. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And hard Home or soft Home might be weaker or stronger but it sort of moves together. This quarter, there were definitely categories outperforms, underperformances to a greater degree than normal. So we're still sort of going through all of that and trying to understand better why that would be. I don't know there is so much lifecycle related. There's certainly cases of that perhaps you're calling out may be user category might be one but that's a true of. But I think product cycle but more importantly, category performance we'll always take a really critical look at. And the second one is, Home is more impacted than any category we sell by marketing. And so when our marketing is not as effective as it needs to be, our event strategy, our media mix strategy is not as effective as it needs to be. Home dramatically will distort that. And you will see it in the performances of the businesses, which basically means we're not reaching the core customer in the way we need to reach them. So I don't know that we've decided one is more critical in terms of our underperformance in the first quarter than the other. But I think that they both play a factor but I think that frankly, the event handles and pricing strategies probably played a bigger factor in the first quarter."

So we know that, that affected our first quarter but I mean, I think, as you see more people report, I'd be shocked if anybody said they had a great March, April. We'll see. from an inventory perspective, I mean, one of the things that Michelle and the merchant and product development teams has been working very hard is increasing the percentage of our receipts that are sourced faster. So one of the success stories has been our SO brand where we've moved a lot more of the production to the 13 -- or 12 to 14 week lead time from right in the order to get into the store. That's moved up from a percentage basis quite a bit. They comp mid-teens this quarter on a inventory reduction of a couple of 2%, same as the company. So we're trying to move more of our private and exclusive brands to that. Over the next couple of years, we want to move from 20% of that being sourced within that time frame to about 50% of our product. Some of the things don't make much sense that are very cost sensitive and don't change a lot like men's cargo pants or a lot of the kids quote that you're looking for the absolute lowest price because that customer is so price sensitive. But many of our women's brands, both in private and exclusive need to move more quickly to that fast fashion type of model and Michelle and the PT guys are driving very hard in doing that. So it's really the first example of that will do more of that as we move throughout the year with brands like imply Vera Vera Wang and Apartment 9 and move into next year."

I mean, fundamentally, Paul, in the short term, if you're running the business like ours, when you're faced with a surprise because, I think, we really were surprised by the March, April underperformance. In the short term, you lower inventory, you lower expenses but you add marketing and drive value, that's what you do to change the trend of our business proactively. You can't wait and hope that things will get better, and you have to sort of plan that things will continue this way and therefore, this is the way to do in a longer term than other things come into play and you start thinking about capital allocation and how much money you're spending but that's a much longer-term view.

I don't think there is a material slowdown, the same things that affect traffic in the stores. You don't need short you are not going to buy them online just because it's easier and could shift to your house for free. You buy it when you need it. So I think that's I am not too worried about digital from that perspective. We kind of guided to 15% to 20% increase in our 3-year plan, and we saw the biggest increase last year in the back half. And I suspect that will be the case this year too as people find it more convenient in the fourth quarter to shop online. From a store base perspective, we closed every store really that had negative incremental free cash flow that's how we look at it. We even closed a few stores that were slightly positive. We needed to get a base of stores that was significant enough to see what happens to both online business and surrounding sister stores when we closed stores, as well as what happens when we close a couple of stories in one particular market. So we've only closed prior to this year, I mean, probably 5 or 6 stories in my 13 years here, so we didn't really have enough data points. We have to run the numbers as we move throughout the year, obviously if comps don't improved, in the stores there will be more stores that tip over to negative cash flow, and we'll look at that on an annual basis. But for the most part, we have stores that are very much generating cash flow. I don't think you're going to see us close a significant number of stores every year. I think 18 was sort of starting plan, I think, it would be a lot lower than that if we decided to close stores for this year, for example."

We never look for a year to bump one of the things that we're looking for and didn't plan that in our path to the 21 billion that we've laid out a couple of years ago. So we really didn't build any incrementalist into it as last year in the fourth quarter. We are making a concerted effort in the back half after we roll out a new point-of-sale system to use the loyalty information if they've completed their profile to do a prescreen on them for our credit card and try to get people to move along the value path from not having a loyalty card to having a [indiscernible] rewards card and then hopefully, getting them to sign up for our credit card.

Comp sales decreased 3.9% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of 190 basis point increase in units per transaction and 100 basis points decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's and women's were the strongest categories and home was the weakest. On a regional basis, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest were the strongest. The West and South Central were the most difficult regions.
Gross margin decreased approximately 140 basis points for the quarter, about 10 basis points better than we guided to last quarter. Most of the margin decrease was due to clearance markdowns, taken to clear excess merchandise.
Our SG&A expenses decreased $8 million to $1 billion for the quarter. We effectively managed discretionary spending, but were not able to leverage expenses on a sales decrease. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 75 basis points.
Store payroll dollars were slightly higher than last year as we pulled back on staffing to align with sales but did not leverage. Marketing deleveraged on higher spending associated with our Academy Awards sponsorship and higher digital spending. IT expenses also deleveraged.
Partially offsetting these increases were higher credit income and lower corporate expenses. Our credit share of sales was 58.8%, up 81 basis points from last year. Logistics expenses were also less than last year.
Depreciation expense was $234 million. The $7 million increase over last year is primarily due to higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing last summer.
Our income tax rate was 37.6%. The tax rate increased approximately 230 basis points as last year's first quarter included some favorable tax -- state tax audit settlements that we didn't have this year.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $17 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.09. For the quarter, we reported $64 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced earlier this year. The charge includes $53 million of impairment charges on the 18 stores which we closed later this year. The remaining $11 million is primarily termination benefits for employees impacted by the closures and restructuring.
We expect to incur an additional $105 million to $110 million next quarter, which is slightly higher than our original estimates as we have more store associates than expected due to termination packages over relocation to another stores.
Substantially all of next quarter's charge will be to record lease-related liabilities for stores we are closing prior to lease termination.
Excluding the store closures and restructure charges, net income was $58 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share. We opened 3 new stores during the quarter, including our first 2 smaller 35,000 square foot format pilot stores. We currently operate 1,167 stores.
Gross square footage is 100.6 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.9 million square feet. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee market. We ended the quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $772 million from last year. 
Inventory dollars per store were 2% lower than the first quarter of 2015 consistent with our guidance of down low single-digits despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were essentially flat as increases in national brand were more than offset by decreases in private and exclusive brands. AP as a percent of inventory decreased 650 basis points to 32.9%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts.
We also received some benefit in Q1 and Q2 of last year due to earlier-arriving receipts related to conservative planning after the port disruption in fall 2014 and spring 2015. Receipt flow year-over-year should be normalized by the third quarter of 2016. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of last year. Weighted average diluted shares were 184 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 185 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on June 22 to shareholders of record on June 8. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our sea",1055,"Thanks, Wes. The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our seasonal business has followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales trend. 
A little more color on our sales. Men's and women's were better than the company with strength in active across both of those categories. Basic and dress clothing were relatively strong in men's but juniors and intimate were better in women's.
Kids, accessories and shoes were similar to the company with relative strength in boys and girls, beauty and fine jewelry as well as kid's shoes. Home was below the company with bedding, luggage and seasonal being outperformers with the balance being more difficult.
We did do a good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate dropped 140 basis points versus our projection of 150 basis points of a drop due to better-than-planned promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 2%, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect to make progress on inventory throughout this year. And we're targeting end of second quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per-store basis.
On the SG&A line, every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend slightly less than last year in dollars versus our expectations originally of a 3% to 4% planned increase.
The team has shown agility to be able to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda.
And our focus on product initiatives. Our national brands in the first quarter, we launched Stride Rite in kid's shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area. The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 19% comp in the quarter.
Our national brands in total were slightly positive on a comp basis with active and wellness leading the way with a mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a mid-teens comp in the quarter.
National brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter. We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their prior trend.
During the quarter, we also launched Reed from Reed Krakoff's in handbags as improving our Accessories assortment has been a goal for us and it's off to a very good start.
Our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store fleet. As we enter the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is now localized. We saw a modest lift in quarter 1 but would expect the effect of this to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods, like second into third quarter, where localized assortments should make a bigger impact.
In our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand with online generated demand achieving a mid-teens increase, as expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for our customer.
In the first quarter, Ship from Store was 15% of our online demand and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store was 3%. We believe we have a big opportunity there and we'll continue to test marketing that option throughout the year to make a top of mind in our customers for holiday.
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 12 million customers and growing. During the quarter, we added the capability to use Apple Pay with our Kohl's Charge Card and our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program, becoming the first retailer to integrate its private-label charge card and loyalty program within Apple Pay.
On a store update front, we opened 2 small format stores during the quarter, and we have a lot of learnings already that we will incorporate into our fall planned openings. A big learning was the need to be flexible in our offerings as each trade area is unique due to the relatively small size of the trade areas and our smaller store size as well.
Localization we believe will be critical for our success in this initiative. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee area, one in an off-price center in one in a strip center. We're pleased to the initial results, and we'll monitor any effects on cannibalization, which we would expect be very small. And in late May, we'll open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.
Moving on to expenses. I mentioned in the year-end call that we're beginning an effort to reduce our leverage point on expenses from a 2% comparable sales increase to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. Despite the fact we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, we feel more confident that we'll be able to achieve that goal.
I think you can see that, given our ability to manage expenses in the first quarter. We expect to find additional savings throughout the year that will allow us to achieve our expense goals.
In conclusion, it was definitely a difficult start to 2016. It's hard to gauge how much of the sales shortfall is related to macroeconomic factors and how much is related to company-specific factors. We're definitely focused on improving our sales but especially, our traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. We're relooking in all of our marketing vehicle to see where we can drive more business to the stores as well as ensuring our value message is particularly strong. Definitely not satisfied with the results so far, and we'll take action to remain top of mind with the families that we serve. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

This quarter, there were definitely categories outperformances, underperformances to a greater degree than normal. So we're still sort of going through all of that and trying to understand better why that would be. I don't know that is so much lifecycle related. There's certainly cases of that. Perhaps you calling out maybe the juicer category might be one that, that's true of. But I think product cycle but more importantly, category performance we'll always take a really critical look at. And then the second one is, Home is more impacted than any category we sell by marketing. And so when our marketing is not as effective as it needs to be, our event strategy, our media mix strategy is not as effective as it needs to be. Home dramatically will distort that. And you will see it in the performances of the businesses, which basically means we're not reaching the core customer in the way that we need to reach them. So I don't know that we've decided one is more critical in terms of our underperformance in the first quarter than the other. But I think that they both play a factor but I think that frankly, the event handles and pricing strategies probably played a bigger factor in the first quarter."

We'll see. from an inventory perspective, I mean, one of the things that Michelle and the merchant and product development teams have been working very hard is increasing the percentage of our receipts that are sourced faster. So one of the success stories has been our SO brand where we've moved a lot more of the production to the 13 -- or 12 to 14 week lead time from right in the order to get into the store. That's moved up from a percentage basis quite a bit. They comp mid-teens this quarter on a inventory reduction of a couple of 2%, same as the company. So we're trying to move more of our private and exclusive brands to that. Over the next couple of years, we want to move from 20% of that being sourced within that time frame to about 50% of our product. Some of the things don't make much sense that are very cost sensitive and don't change a lot like men's cargo pants or a lot of the kids clothes that you're looking for the absolute lowest price because that customer is so price sensitive. But many of our women's brands, both in private and exclusive, need to move more quickly to that fast fashion type of model and Michelle and the PD guys are driving very hard in doing that. So it was really the first example of that. We'll do more of that as we move throughout the year with brands like Simply Vera Vera Wang and Apartment 9 and move into next year."

In the short term, you lower inventory, you lower expenses but you add marketing and drive value, that's what you do to change the trend of our business proactively. You can't wait and hope that things will get better, and you have to sort of plan that things will continue this way and therefore, this is what you do.

It's not as profitable and I think everybody is coming around to that. Having said that, I think, we missed our plan slightly in digital, it was only on a couple of days. So I don't think there is a material slowdown. The same things that affect traffic in the stores. You don't need shorts, you are not going to buy them online just because it's easier and could ship to your house for free. You'll buy it when you need it. So I think that's -- I am not too worried about digital from that perspective. We kind of guided to a 15% to 20% increase in our 3-year plan, and we saw the biggest increase last year in the back half. And I suspect that will be the case this year too as people find it more convenient in the fourth quarter to shop online. From a store base perspective, we closed every store really that had negative incremental free cash flow; that's how we look at it. We even closed a few stores that were slightly positive. We needed to get a base of stores that was significant enough to see what happens to both online business and surrounding sister stores when we closed stores, as well as what happens when we close a couple of stories in one particular market. So we've only closed prior to this year, I mean, probably 5 or 6 stories in my 13 years here, so we didn't really have enough data points. We'll have to run the numbers as we move throughout the year. Obviously, if comps don't improve in the stores, there will be more stores that tip over to negative cash flow, and we'll look at that on an annual basis. But for the most part, we have stores that are very much generating cash flow. I don't think you're going to see us close a significant number of stores every year. I think 18 was sort of starting plan, I think, it would be a lot lower than that if we decided to close stores for this year, for example."

So we really didn't build any incrementality into it past last year in the fourth quarter. We are making a concerted effort in the back half after we roll out a new point-of-sale system to use the loyalty information if they've completed their profile to do a prescreen on them for our credit card and try to get people to move along the value path from not having a loyalty card to having a, I guess, T [ph] rewards card and then hopefully, getting them to sign up for our credit card.

Comp sales decreased 3.9% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of 190 basis point increase in units per transaction and 100 basis points decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's and women's were the strongest categories and home was the weakest. On a regional basis, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest were the strongest. The West and South Central were the most difficult regions.
Gross margin decreased approximately 140 basis points for the quarter, about 10 basis points better than we guided to last quarter. Most of the margin decrease was due to clearance markdowns, taken to clear excess merchandise.
Our SG&A expenses decreased $8 million to $1 billion for the quarter. We effectively managed discretionary spending, but were not able to leverage expenses on a sales decrease. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 75 basis points.
Store payroll dollars were slightly higher than last year as we pulled back on staffing to align with sales but did not leverage. Marketing deleveraged on higher spending associated with our Academy Awards sponsorship and higher digital spending. IT expenses also deleveraged.
Partially offsetting these increases were higher credit income and lower corporate expenses. Our credit share of sales was 58.8%, up 81 basis points from last year. Logistics expenses were also less than last year.
Depreciation expense was $234 million. The $7 million increase over last year is primarily due to higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing last summer.
Our income tax rate was 37.6%. The tax rate increased approximately 230 basis points as last year's first quarter included some favorable tax -- state tax audit settlements that we didn't have this year.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $17 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.09. For the quarter, we reported $64 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced earlier this year. The charge includes $53 million of impairment charges on the 18 stores which we closed later this year. The remaining $11 million is primarily termination benefits for employees impacted by the closures and restructuring.
We expect to incur an additional $105 million to $110 million next quarter, which is slightly higher than our original estimates as we have more store associates than expected due to termination packages over relocation to another stores.
Substantially all of next quarter's charge will be to record lease-related liabilities for stores we are closing prior to lease termination.
Excluding the store closures and restructure charges, net income was $58 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share. We opened 3 new stores during the quarter, including our first 2 smaller 35,000 square foot format pilot stores. We currently operate 1,167 stores.
Gross square footage is 100.6 million square feet and selling square footage is 83.9 million square feet. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee market. We ended the quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $772 million from last year. 
Inventory dollars per store were 2% lower than the first quarter of 2015 consistent with our guidance of down low single-digits despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were essentially flat as increases in national brand were more than offset by decreases in private and exclusive brands. AP as a percent of inventory decreased 650 basis points to 32.9%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts.
We also received some benefit in Q1 and Q2 of last year due to earlier-arriving receipts related to conservative planning after the port disruption in fall 2014 and spring 2015. Receipt flow year-over-year should be normalized by the third quarter of 2016. 
Capital expenditures were $177 million for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of last year. Weighted average diluted shares were 184 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 185 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on June 22 to shareholders of record on June 8. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results."

The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our sea",1055,"Thanks, Wes. The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our seasonal business has followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales trend. 
A little more color on our sales. Men's and women's were better than the company with strength in active across both of those categories. Basic and dress clothing were relatively strong in men's but juniors and intimate were better in women's.
Kids, accessories and shoes were similar to the company with relative strength in boys and girls, beauty and fine jewelry as well as kid's shoes. Home was below the company with bedding, luggage and seasonal being outperformers with the balance being more difficult.
We did do a good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate dropped 140 basis points versus our projection of 150 basis points of a drop due to better-than-planned promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 2%, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect to make progress on inventory throughout this year. And we're targeting end of second quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per-store basis.
On the SG&A line, every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend slightly less than last year in dollars versus our expectations originally of a 3% to 4% planned increase.
The team has shown agility to be able to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda.
And our focus on product initiatives. Our national brands in the first quarter, we launched Stride Rite in kid's shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area. The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 19% comp in the quarter.
Our national brands in total were slightly positive on a comp basis with active and wellness leading the way with a mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a mid-teens comp in the quarter.
National brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter. We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their prior trend.
During the quarter, we also launched Reed from Reed Krakoff's in handbags as improving our Accessories assortment has been a goal for us and it's off to a very good start.
Our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store fleet. As we enter the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is now localized. We saw a modest lift in quarter 1 but would expect the effect of this to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods, like second into third quarter, where localized assortments should make a bigger impact.
In our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand with online generated demand achieving a mid-teens increase, as expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for our customer.
In the first quarter, Ship from Store was 15% of our online demand and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store was 3%. We believe we have a big opportunity there and we'll continue to test marketing that option throughout the year to make a top of mind in our customers for holiday.
Our Kohl's app was used by more than 12 million customers and growing. During the quarter, we added the capability to use Apple Pay with our Kohl's Charge Card and our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program, becoming the first retailer to integrate its private-label charge card and loyalty program within Apple Pay.
On a store update front, we opened 2 small format stores during the quarter, and we have a lot of learnings already that we will incorporate into our fall planned openings. A big learning was the need to be flexible in our offerings as each trade area is unique due to the relatively small size of the trade areas and our smaller store size as well.
Localization we believe will be critical for our success in this initiative. We also opened 2 Off-Aisle stores in the Milwaukee area, one in an off-price center in one in a strip center. We're pleased to the initial results, and we'll monitor any effects on cannibalization, which we would expect be very small. And in late May, we'll open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.
Moving on to expenses. I mentioned in the year-end call that we're beginning an effort to reduce our leverage point on expenses from a 2% comparable sales increase to a 1.5% comparable sales increase. Despite the fact we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, we feel more confident that we'll be able to achieve that goal.
I think you can see that, given our ability to manage expenses in the first quarter. We expect to find additional savings throughout the year that will allow us to achieve our expense goals.
In conclusion, it was definitely a difficult start to 2016. It's hard to gauge how much of the sales shortfall is related to macroeconomic factors and how much is related to company-specific factors. We're definitely focused on improving our sales but especially, our traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. We're relooking in all of our marketing vehicle to see where we can drive more business to the stores as well as ensuring our value message is particularly strong.

But I think fundamentally, we still feel very confident about the plan that the plan is the right plan and our actions are the right actions. In the short term, I think, Wes and I both say, I think -- we wish that some of our event handles and efforts were better. If we had known that there was going to be a macro traffic issue and, in particular, I would say in April and had we known that some of the results of the change in our media [ph] mix was going to have the effect it did. And again, mostly I'd say April, we would have done things differently. And obviously, informed by that, we're making changes to our June and July plans to accommodate it."

This quarter, there were definitely categories outperformances, underperformances to a greater degree than normal.

Perhaps you calling out maybe the juicer category might be one that, that's true of. But I think product cycle but more importantly, category performance we'll always take a really critical look at. And then the second one is, Home is more impacted than any category we sell by marketing. And so when our marketing is not as effective as it needs to be, our event strategy, our media mix strategy is not as effective as it needs to be. Home dramatically will distort that. And you will see it in the performances of the businesses, which basically means we're not reaching the core customer in the way that we need to reach them. So I don't know that we've decided one is more critical in terms of our underperformance in the first quarter than the other. But I think that they both play a factor but I think that frankly, the event handles and pricing strategies probably played a bigger factor in the first quarter."

We'll see. from an inventory perspective, I mean, one of the things that Michelle and the merchant and product development teams have been working very hard is increasing the percentage of our receipts that are sourced faster. So one of the success stories has been our SO brand where we've moved a lot more of the production to the 13 -- or 12 to 14 week lead time from right in the order to get into the store. That's moved up from a percentage basis quite a bit. They comp mid-teens this quarter on a inventory reduction of a couple of 2%, same as the company. So we're trying to move more of our private and exclusive brands to that. Over the next couple of years, we want to move from 20% of that being sourced within that time frame to about 50% of our product. Some of the things don't make much sense that are very cost sensitive and don't change a lot like men's cargo pants or a lot of the kids clothes that you're looking for the absolute lowest price because that customer is so price sensitive. But many of our women's brands, both in private and exclusive, need to move more quickly to that fast fashion type of model and Michelle and the PD guys are driving very hard in doing that. So it was really the first example of that. We'll do more of that as we move throughout the year with brands like Simply Vera Vera Wang and Apartment 9 and move into next year."

It's not as profitable and I think everybody is coming around to that. Having said that, I think, we missed our plan slightly in digital, it was only on a couple of days. So I don't think there is a material slowdown. The same things that affect traffic in the stores. You don't need shorts, you are not going to buy them online just because it's easier and could ship to your house for free. You'll buy it when you need it. So I think that's -- I am not too worried about digital from that perspective. We kind of guided to a 15% to 20% increase in our 3-year plan, and we saw the biggest increase last year in the back half. And I suspect that will be the case this year too as people find it more convenient in the fourth quarter to shop online. From a store base perspective, we closed every store really that had negative incremental free cash flow; that's how we look at it. We even closed a few stores that were slightly positive. We needed to get a base of stores that was significant enough to see what happens to both online business and surrounding sister stores when we closed stores, as well as what happens when we close a couple of stories in one particular market. So we've only closed prior to this year, I mean, probably 5 or 6 stories in my 13 years here, so we didn't really have enough data points. We'll have to run the numbers as we move throughout the year. Obviously, if comps don't improve in the stores, there will be more stores that tip over to negative cash flow, and we'll look at that on an annual basis. But for the most part, we have stores that are very much generating cash flow. I don't think you're going to see us close a significant number of stores every year. I think 18 was sort of starting plan, I think, it would be a lot lower than that if we decided to close stores for this year, for example."

So there's nothing that's currently happened that in my mind would accelerate that discussion. And at the same time, there's nothing that's currently happened that would decelerate it. I think it's always on the table. We generally have had a view that share in categories that we operate in is really important. So having scale is an important factor to long-term success. And so right now, the plan that we've described to you gets us to scale by driving essentially our business organically. We certainly have these new tests, which I think have the possibility of paying off and things like our Off-Aisle concept or our outlet concept, the first one is with the Fila brand. And I still think that the small 35k store is going to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term performance. I don't know that, that particular store size will add a lot of growth, but I think it will address what we both know is a really key factor right now, which is there's too much retail square footage. And so as some of our largest stores come up, we'll definitely be looking at our smaller store footprints as ways to continue to keep presence in the trade area but do it more productively. Hopefully, that answers your question but there's nothing that's happening right now that we would share with you specifically around consolidation."

So we really didn't build any incrementality into it past last year in the fourth quarter. We are making a concerted effort in the back half after we roll out a new point-of-sale system to use the loyalty information if they've completed their profile to do a prescreen on them for our credit card and try to get people to move along the value path from not having a loyalty card to having a, I guess, T [ph] rewards card and then hopefully, getting them to sign up for our credit card.

With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives and then we'll take some of your questions.
Comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter, below our expectations but significantly improved over first quarter results. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 300 basis points comprised of a 310 basis point increase in units per transaction and 10 basis point decrease in average unit retail. 
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category while home was the weakest. All other businesses were generally consistent with the company average. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Midwest and West were strongest. The Northeast, South Central and Mid-Atlantic were below the company. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin increased 53 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over the 140 basis point decrease we saw in the first quarter. The increase was driven by savings in both promotional markdown and permanent clearance markdowns. 
Our SG&A decreased $19 million to $986 million for the quarter and deleveraged only 3 basis points on a 2% decline in sales. Our teams continue to aggressively and effectively manage to our payroll as sales trends change versus our plan, but we were unable to leverage other expenses versus last year. 
IT and corporate expenses also deleveraged. Partially offset these increases were slightly higher credit income and lower variable store cost and marketing expenses. Depreciation expense was essentially flat to last year at $234 million. 
Our interest expense decreased $6 million to $78 million for the quarter as we saw the benefits of last summers refinancing. Our income tax rate was 37.5%. The tax rate decreased approximately 40 basis points from last year as a result of federal tax credits that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $140 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.77. During the quarter, we recorded $128 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $192 million. As you saw on our release, the second quarter charge includes $119 million in future store lease obligations, $23 million in software licenses, which did not aligned with the strategic vision of our restructured IT leadership team and $7 million in severance and other costs, which were partially offset by the write-off of $21 million and net lease obligations that were previously recorded on our books. 
Of the year-to-date charge, $57 million is noncash write-offs of assets and liabilities that were previously recorded on our books. All of the severance will be paid out within 2 years. $119 million lease obligation charge represents a discounted value of rents and other lease liabilities under noncancelable lease terms. 
Our real estate team was able to terminate leases at 3 of the locations during the quarter. They're actively working with landlords and potential subtenants at the 13 remaining lease locations. Assuming worst-case scenario that we are unable to terminate any additional leases before their maturity, the $119 million will be paid out over the next 13 years. The maximum expected payment in every given -- any given year is less than $10 million. Actual cost reported for the quarter were $18 million higher than the high-end of our prior estimate. All of the [ph] is due to the write-off of software licenses. We do not expect material changes -- charges in future periods. 
Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, net income increased 5% to $221 million and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.22 per share. We currently operate 1,150 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.7 million square feet. 
We also operate 12 FILA Outlets, which opened during the current quarter. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $234 million from last year due to the timing of last summer's debt refinancing. As you may recall, we have $317 [ph] million from the refinancing proceeds on balance sheet in July of last year that we used to pay off bond tendered in August. 
Year-to-date, we generated almost $450 million in free cash flow, a $525 million improvement over the first half of last year. I'm very pleased with our inventory initiatives and our ability to decrease inventory dollars per store by 6% from the second quarter of last year despite the challenging sales environment. 
Units per store were 7% lower than the second quarter of last year. Our Accounts Payable as a percent of inventory decreased 182 basis points to 35%. All the decrease is due to lower receipts, especially in late June and in July, which have a larger impact on the AP to inventory ratio than receipts from earlier in the quarter. As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had extraordinary amount of early arriving receipts due to improvement times and transit times. After the West Coast port [ph], operations return to normal. 
Capital expenditures were $340 million for the spring season, $37 million lower than last year, which included higher beauty spending as we finish the rollout of our enhanced beauty environment now in all stores and some corporate campus spending as we consolidate space here in Wisconsin. 
Weighted average diluted shares were $181 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock. We ended quarter with 181 million shares of stock outstanding. 
On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on September 21 to shareholders of record on September 7. 
After reviewing our results for the spring season, we are updating our guidance to $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, the guidance would be $3.80 to $4 per diluted share. 
The guidance includes the following assumptions for the fall season: Total sales decrease of 2.6%, up 0.6 to last year; a comp sales decrease of 2% to flat to last year; gross margin rate improvement of approximately 20 to 40 basis points over last year; and SG&A dollar growth of 0.5% to 2% over last year. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

July finished very strong as we moved our credit event a week closer to Back-to-School and those businesses, especially juniors, young men's and girls performed extremely well. 
Our seasonal business in the quarter followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales. A little more color on our sales. Men's was better than the company, with strength in active, young men's, basic and dress clothing and short and swimmer. Footwear ran with the company with strength in kids and men's dress casual and weakness in women's. 
Children's showed relatively strength in girls and boys while infants and toddlers was more difficult as we continue to work on revitalizing our Jumping Beans brand. Women's showed strength in active, intimate and swim, while updated contemporary and classic sportswear continued to remain more difficult. 
Accessories continued to be driven by beauty and fine jewelry with the remainder of the business being challenged. And finally, home trailed the company, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter as both bedding and luggage were strengths. 
We did a very good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate increase of 53 basis points was better than our plan due to both better initial markup and lower promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 6%, in line with our expectations. 
We continue to expect to make progress on this thought the year, targeting end of third quarter levels of down mid-single-digits on a per-store basis. Our receipts will be down in the third quarter and slightly up in the fourth quarter as we bring in more transitional receipts than we did last year with the holiday season. 
We are being very conservative in our cold weather categories as we expect the third quarter to be soft with the fourth quarter improving versus last year's mild winter. 
On the SG&A line, almost every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend less than last year in dollars and significantly less than our plans. I continue to be impressed but the team's agility to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. 
I'd now like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product, on national national brands, our first quarter launches of Stride Rite and children's shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area continue to pay dividends. 
The launch of Stride Rite helped kid shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 9% comp for the quarter. Our national brands in total were up low single digits, with active and wellness leading the way for the mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a low double-digit comp in the quarter. The active and wellness category itself is now 18% of our total business. Finally, national brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter. 
We're incredibly excited to add Under Armour to our active and wellness category in early 2017. We've already established the strong leadership position in the active and wellness area, and adding one of the most sought-after brands to our portfolio of offerings will allow us to project that leadership even more fully. As you know, this area has consistently been one of our fastest-growing categories in the store, and we would expect that adding Under Armour will extend that period of growth, accelerate the rate of growth and attract a new customer to our store at the same time. 
We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their trend. One big initiative that we need to take a gross more of our private and exclusive brands is the need to improve our speed to market. 
We started to do this with our so brand in Juniors, and we're achieving double-digit comps this spring on less inventory than last year. Michelle is working with our product development teams to reduce the end-to-end cycle on our private and exclusive brands by 25% on average, and we have a goal of approximately 40% reduction in women's. 
This takes the success we have seen and saw with this initiative, and we're rolling out this to Candace and Juniors as well as urban pipeline in young men's. [ph] apparel will be the next area of focus. 
Our localization efforts are proving out in 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our assortments across all stores. 
As we exit the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is already localized. We saw a modest lift in the spring season, achieving higher sales and lower inventory per store versus our control groups. We would expect the effect to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods by quarter 2 into quarter 3, where localized assortments should have a much bigger impact. 
And our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand, with online generated demand achieving a midteens increase, as we expected. We continue to invest in technology and training our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for the time strapped customer. 
In the second quarter, the combination of Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store sales reached 21% of total dollar online demand and 23% of total unit online demand, both increasing versus the first quarter. 
We do believe we have a big opportunity there, both short and long-term, which we think will only continue to amplify the role and relevancy of our brick-and-mortar stores. 
And finally, our Kohl's app was downloaded by more than 13.5 million customers, continues to grow in both downloads but more importantly, usage, particularly aspects like the digital wallet. 
On a store update basis, we opened 12 Fila stores in May and 2 additional Off/Aisle stores in March, in both cases, we're generally pleased with the results and implementing operational changes as we learned from the results. 
We'll be opening 6 smaller format stores in the third quarter, adding to the 235,000-foot smaller stores we opened in the first quarter. Even more importantly than in our standard prototype stores, we've seen the importance of flexibility and localization in our offerings as each trade area is unique due to both small trade area and small store size. 
In 2017, we'll be looking for a small number of these stores to open in more populated markets to ascertain the potential and the possible use as a tool to serve trade areas where our full-size stores have too much square footage. 
In conclusion, I'm very happy with the efforts the organization has made around rightsizing our inventory and the resulting improvement in merchandise margin and cash flow. We reached our objective, aggressive objective of reducing inventories from last year by 6% per store at the end of the second quarter. And that will position us well to continue through  fall and holiday. I'm also equally pleased with the team's ability to manage expenses down in a tougher sales environment. 
We continue to work to create more momentum in our sales trend and this is our primary focus as we enter the fall and holiday. For the second quarter performance and sales certainly improved over the first quarter. We did have declines in foot traffic in our stores generally and this needs to be reversed to the positive. The key areas of focus and continuing that improvement in sales are, of course, marketing and merchandising. 
On the marketing side, we're is centered on projecting all of our loyalty components, rewards, Kohl's Cash and credit offers more completely. In our merchandising side, our focus is on improving our speed and agility across all of our businesses, but most importantly, our largest one, women's apparel. 
As you heard in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, we're looking to continue to improve on each of our key metrics the state conservative and the level of improvement expected. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

On the more sustainability aspect of the comp looking forward, I think, as we sort of alluded to in the call, we're obviously very focused on the 2 most important elements, merchandising and marketing. On the merchandising side, I would say we're going to continue to drive our national brand strategy, in particular continue to amplify the importance of active and wellness because we think that the trend is taking hold very strongly. And while we have a good leadership position, I think, expanding the portfolio with Under Armour is going to make a massive difference. We're actually going to invest in the stores across the whole active area to make that areas stand out more as part of the launch of Under Armour. And then secondly, in merchandising, we touched on the fact that we know that we have to be faster in our product cycle from beginning to end on our private and exclusive brands. And so we've seen in the success in the areas where we piloted, and I think Michelle and the team is focused on expanding that to women's across the board and then, of course, to the overall store as well. On the marketing side, I think, we touched on probably the most important thing, which is continuing to wrap up all of our loyalty efforts more successfully, so pulling together the credit offers, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards. And I think as we analyze the results of our business over time, we probably have had opportunity there. They often stood alone and we're well connected in the communication with the customer. So I think Michelle feels pretty strongly that that's going to be a major opportunity going forward. So merchandise and marketing are our vocals, brands of the national side continue to have them but drive the ones we have and most importantly, improve the speed around our private and exclusive brands and then really focus on loyalty as a concept in our marketing."

I mean, overall, as you know we've closed some stores this year, and I think our expectation is we're going to be able to probably understand more about the impact of that on markets and other trade areas inside of markets that might positively benefit from those store closures. I don't expect this to be able to do a thorough analysis to get a good understanding of that until next spring because we really need to go through the fall and holiday season to analyze that to a great degree. As a result, we honestly don't expect any store closures next year as of right now. The second part of that answer long-term is we think that our stores are really important and as we noted in the call, more and more were seen the role in relevancy of the store come to life through being able to use our stores as shipping points for customers as they go online to buy product but also pick up points as customers choose the convenience of buying online but begin up in the store and therefore shipping or time delay as well. And so that number continues to grow, I think, Wes was pretty excited about the fact that it reached 21% in dollars, 23% in units. I expect that at the end of the third quarter, it's going to be even higher and I would really expect at the end of the fourth quarter is going to be much of the higher just because of the nature of the business.

But the reason is that $3.8 to $4 [ph] we did report that we'll make $3.80. Our internal expectations from a sales perspective are to improve. If we can hit those, we'll make $4. From a leverage perspective, we've lowered our internal goal from a 2% to 1.5%. We did much better than that this spring. I mean, if you do the math of the numbers I gave you, we should leverage a little bit above a flat comp for the year. I can't sign up for that forever. But we do have a lot of initiatives going forward were I hope we do better than the 1.5% but that's what we're committing to at this point."

One is, and I think Wes may have mentioned it, if not, I'll make sure that you know. As we look into the fall and holiday, we definitely are planning, we plan down to seasonal categories, substantially more than the overall business. So we feel like we want to make sure that we're in front of that and not chasing it, and we much rather be in a position where we run low or do have to chase product in highly seasonal category. So the plan has a aspect to it. The longer term answer is definitely is the speed initiative because many of our national brand businesses are less weather sensitive. And most of our private and exclusive brand product is actually relatively highly weather sensitive. So I think longer term, we feel like the speed initiative is the solution. We've positioned private and exclusive brands, I think, Wes, on an inventory basis really well in to the fall and holiday. We're down."

We have modest improvement in our business and in traffic but it's still negative. So until such time as we can implement these merchandising and marketing changes, we don't plan for traffic to turn positive. And so as I said earlier on the call, we're planning traffic to be lower than sales in the near term. And in terms of competition, I think, Wes also address that a little bit earlier, we continue to see, and we expect that both Amazon and generally off-price space is gaining share. And so to the extent we can, we are really focused on making changes to our business model that would just allow us to compete more effectively. And one of the things that we're probably doing and have a strong point of view about is the importance of our stores to do that. We still -- we're in a good position in that we have stores who pass our hurdles and are financially performing but traffic is down. So if we don't get that turnaround at some point, we have the building of new stores more effectively. But we're piloting these much smaller stores as perhaps replacements so we continue to have points of distribution. But they are less square footage and then we are trying to you device is a must point of what distribution to BOPUS in Ship from Store strategy. So I think Wes, and I, Michelle, [ph], [ph], we all feel like stores a really important part of our future, and we just have to make them work harder for us customers and having more presence in markets has an impact on brand awareness, in share awareness, beyond just distributing the product and access point.

With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results, and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives, and then we'll take some of your questions.
Comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter, below our expectations but significantly improved over first quarter results. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 300 basis points comprised of 310 basis point increase in units per transaction and 10 basis point decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category, while home was the weakest. All other businesses were generally consistent with the company average. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Midwest and West were strongest. The Northeast, South Central and Mid-Atlantic were below the company. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks.
Gross margin increased 53 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over the 140 basis point decrease we saw in the first quarter. The increase was driven by savings in both promotional markdown and permanent clearance markdowns.
Our SG&A decreased $19 million to $986 million for the quarter and deleveraged only 3 basis points on a 2% decline in sales. Our teams continue to aggressively and effectively manage to our payroll as sales trends change versus our plan, but we were unable to leverage other expenses versus last year.
IT and corporate expenses also deleveraged. Partially offsetting these increases were slightly higher credit income and lower variable store cost and marketing expenses. Depreciation expense was essentially flat to last year at $234 million.
Our interest expense decreased $6 million to $78 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefits of last summers refinancing. Our income tax rate was 37.5%. The tax rate decreased approximately 40 basis points from last year, as a result of federal tax credits that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $140 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.77. During the quarter, we recorded $128 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $192 million. As you saw on our release, the second quarter charge includes $119 million in future store lease obligations; $23 million in software licenses, which did not align with the strategic vision of our restructured IT leadership team; and $7 million in severance and other costs, which were partially offset by the write-off of $21 million and net lease obligations that were previously recorded on our books.
Of the year-to-date charge, $57 million is noncash write-offs of assets and liabilities that were previously recorded on our books. All of the severance will be paid out within 2 years. The $119 million lease obligation charge represents a discounted value of rents and other lease liabilities under noncancelable lease terms.
Our real estate team was able to terminate leases at 3 of the locations during the quarter. They're actively working with landlords and potential subtenants at the 13 remaining lease locations. Assuming worst-case scenario that we are unable to terminate any additional leases before their maturity, the $119 million will be paid out over the next 13 years. The maximum expected payment in every given -- any given year is less than $10 million. Actual cost reported for the quarter were $18 million higher than the high-end of our prior estimate, all of the overheads is due to the write-off to the software licenses. We do not expect material changes -- charges in future periods.
Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, net income increased 5% to $221 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.22 per share. We currently operate 1,150 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.7 million square feet.
We also operate 12 FILA Outlets, which opened during the current quarter. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $234 million from last year, due to the timing of last summer's debt refinancing. As you may recall, we have $317 million from the refinancing proceeds on balance sheet in July of last year that we used to pay off bonds tendered in August.
Year-to-date, we generated almost $450 million in free cash flow, a $525 million improvement over the first half of last year. I'm very pleased with our inventory initiatives and our ability to decrease inventory dollars per store by 6% from the second quarter of last year despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were 7% lower than the second quarter of last year. Our Accounts Payable as a percent of inventory decreased 182 basis points to 35%. All the decrease is due to lower receipts, especially in late June and in July, which have a larger impact on the AP to inventory ratio than receipts from earlier in the quarter. As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had extraordinary amount of early arriving receipts, due to improvement times and transit times, after the West Coast port operations returned to normal.
Capital expenditures were $340 million for the spring season, $37 million lower than last year, which included higher beauty spending, as we finished the rollout of our enhanced beauty environment now in all stores and some corporate campus spending as we consolidate space here in Wisconsin.
Weighted average diluted shares were $181 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 181 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on September 21 to shareholders of record on September 7.
After reviewing our results for the spring season, we are updating our guidance to $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, the guidance would be $3.80 to $4 per diluted share.
The guidance includes the following assumptions for the fall season: total sales decrease of 2.6%, up 0.6% to last year; a comp sales decrease of 2% to flat to last year; gross margin rate improvement of approximately 20 to 40 basis points over last year; and SG&A dollar growth of 0.5% to 2% over last year.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

The second quarter was below our expectations in the sales line. May was the weakest month of the quarter. June was aided by warm weather early in the month, along with favorable calendar shifts with Memorial Day falling in fiscal June and Fourth of July moving to fiscal July.
July finished very strong, as we moved our credit event a week closer to Back-to-School, and those businesses, especially juniors, young men's and girls performed extremely well.
Our seasonal businesses in the quarter followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales. A little more color on our sales. Men's was better than the company, with strength in active, young men's, basic and dress clothing and shorts and swimwear. Footwear ran with the company with strength in kids and men's dress casual, and weakness in women's.
Children's showed relative strength in girls and boys, while infants and toddlers was more difficult, as we continue to work on revitalizing our Jumping Beans brand. Women's showed strength in active, intimates and swim, while updated contemporary and classic sportswear continued to remain more difficult.
Accessories continued to be driven by beauty and fine jewelry, with the remainder of the business being challenged. And finally, home trailed the company, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter as both bedding and luggage were strengths.
We did a very good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate increase of 53 basis points was better than our plan due to both better initial markup and lower promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 6%, in line with our expectations.
We continue to expect to make progress on this thought the year, targeting end of third quarter levels of down mid-single-digits on a per-store basis. Our receipts will be down in the third quarter and slightly up in the fourth quarter, as we bring in more transitional receipts than we did last year with the holiday season.
We are being very conservative in our cold weather categories, as we expect the third quarter to be soft, with the fourth quarter improving versus last year's mild winter.
On the SG&A line, almost every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend less than last year in dollars and significantly less than our plans. I continue to be impressed but the team's agility to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. 
I'd now like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product, on national brands, our first quarter launches of Stride Rite in children's shoes and a relaunched New Balance in the active area continue to pay dividends.
The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 9% comp for the quarter. Our national brands in total were up low single digits, with active and wellness leading the way for the mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a low double-digit comp in the quarter. The active and wellness category itself is now 18% of our total business. Finally, national brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter.
We're incredibly excited to add Under Armour to our active and wellness category in early 2017. We've already established a strong leadership position in the active and wellness area, and adding one of the most sought-after brands to our portfolio of offerings will allow us to project that leadership even more fully. As you know, this area has consistently been one of our fastest-growing categories in the store, and we would expect that adding Under Armour will extend that period of growth, accelerate the rate of growth and attract a new customer to our store at the same time.
We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their trend. One big initiative that we need to take across more of our private and exclusive brands is the need to improve our speed to market.
We started to do this with our SO brand in juniors, and we're achieving double-digit comps this spring on less inventory than last year. Michelle is working with our product development teams to reduce the end-to-end cycle on our private and exclusive brands by 25% on average, and we have a goal of approximately 40% reduction in women's.
This takes the success we have seen in SO with this initiative, and we're rolling out this to Candie's and Juniors as well as urban pipeline in young men's. Messi's [ph] apparel will be the next area of focus.
Our localization efforts are proving out in 2016, will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our assortments across all stores.
As we exit the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is already localized. We saw a modest lift in the spring season, achieving higher sales and lower inventory per store versus our control groups. We would expect the effect to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods by quarter 2 into quarter 3, where localized assortments should have a much bigger impact.
And our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand, with online generated demand achieving a midteens increase, as we expected. We continue to invest in technology and training our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for the time strapped customer.
In the second quarter, the combination of Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store sales reached 21% of total dollar online demand and 23% of total unit online demand, both increasing versus the first quarter.
We do believe we have a big opportunity there, both short and long term, which we think will only continue to amplify the role and relevancy of our brick-and-mortar stores.
And finally, our Kohl's app was downloaded by more than 13.5 million customers, continues to grow in both downloads, but more importantly usage, particularly aspects like the digital wallet.
On a store-update basis, we opened 12 FILA stores in May and 2 additional Off/Aisle stores in March, in both cases, we're generally pleased with the results and implementing operational changes as we learned from the results.
We'll be opening 6 smaller format stores in the third quarter, adding to the 235,000-foot smaller stores we opened in the first quarter. Even more importantly than in our standard prototype stores, we've seen the importance of flexibility and localization in our offerings, as each trade area is unique due to both small trade area and small store size.
In 2017, we'll be looking for a small number of these stores to open in more populated markets to ascertain the potential and the possible use as a tool to serve trade areas where our full-size stores have too much square footage.
In conclusion, I'm very happy with the efforts the organization has made around rightsizing our inventory and the resulting improvement in merchandise margin and cash flow. We reached our objective, aggressive objective, of reducing inventories from last year by 6% per store at the end of the second quarter. And that will position us well to continue that rightsizing through fall and holiday. I'm also equally pleased with the team's ability to manage expenses down in a tougher sales environment.
We continue to work to create more momentum in our sales trend, and this is our primary focus as we enter the fall and holiday. For the second quarter performance in sales, certainly, improved over the first quarter. We did have declines in foot traffic in our stores generally, and this needs to be reversed to the positive. The key areas of focus and continuing that improvement in sales are, of course, marketing and merchandising.
On the marketing side, we're centered on projecting all of our loyalty components, rewards, Kohl's Cash and credit offers more completely. In our merchandising side, our focus is on improving our speed and agility across all of our businesses, but most importantly, our largest one, women's apparel.
As you heard in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, we're looking to continue to improve on each of our key metrics and to stay conservative and a level of improvement expected.
Thank you. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

On the merchandising side, I would say we're going to continue to drive our national brand strategy, in particular continue to amplify the importance of active and wellness because we think that's a trend that is taking hold very strongly. And while we have a good leadership position, I think, expanding the portfolio with Under Armour is going to make a massive difference. We're actually going to invest in the stores across the whole active area to make that area standout more as part of the launch of Under Armour. And then secondly, in merchandising, we touched on the fact that we know that we have to be faster in our product cycle from beginning to end on our private and exclusive brands. And so we've seen the success in the areas where we piloted, and I think Michelle and the team is focused on expanding that to women's across the board, and then, of course, to the overall store as well. On the marketing side, I think, we touched on probably the most important thing, which is continuing to wrap up all of our loyalty efforts more successfully, so pulling together the credit offers, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards. And I think as we analyze the results of our business over time, we probably have had opportunity there. They often stood alone, and we're well connected in the communication with the customer. So I think Michelle feels pretty strongly that, that's going to be a major opportunity going forward. So merchandise and marketing are our focus, brands on the national side continue to [indiscernible], but drive the ones we have, most importantly, improve the speed around our private and exclusive brands. And then really focus on loyalty as a concept in our marketing."

I can give you a part of the thinking, and Wes can give more specific to the financial aspect. I mean, overall, as you know, we've closed some stores this year, and I think our expectation is we're going to be able to probably understand more about the impact of that on markets and other trade areas inside of markets that might positively benefit from those store closures. I don't expect this to be able to do a thorough analysis to get a good understanding of that until next spring, because we really need to go through the fall and holiday season to analyze that to a great degree. As a result, we honestly don't expect any store closures next year as of right now. The second part of that answer long term is we think that our stores are really important, and as we noted in the call, more and more we're seeing the role in relevancy of the store come to life through being able to use our stores as shipping points for customers as they go online to buy product, but also as pick up points as customers choose the convenience of buying online but picking up in the store, and therefore, avoiding any shipping or time delay as well. And so that number continues to grow, I think, Wes was pretty excited about the fact that it reached 21% in dollars, 23% in units. I expect that at the end of the third quarter, it's going to be even higher. And I would really expect that the end of the fourth quarter is going to be massively higher, just because of the nature of the business. As it relates to specific financials around stores, Wes could give you a good hand on that."

I mean, I think, frankly, Michelle would tell you that she believes the metric that will improve, if we effectively scale up speed beyond where it's been tested and piloted so far, will be sales. Yes, there's a corresponding positive that comes with more effective inventory, and therefore, if sales improve, as you know, margins on private brands are quite a bit higher, and so there's a possible margin implication that would be to the positive as well.

There's definitely editing opportunities in our private brand, and when I say private brand, I mean including our exclusive brand portfolio.

It will probably tell us pretty quickly which of the brands benefit the most from that, and therefore, will point us in the right direction in terms of downsizing and then eliminating others. We definitely know that, that's an opportunity for us. We've broadened the base of private and exclusive brands that we have to offer over the last 5 years, quite substantially. And I think Michelle feels like there's a chance to tighten it up. Our big private brands though, the billion-dollar-plus brands of SONOMA and Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9, they're not go away. And those are the ones that probably will benefit the most. There is always good things and bad things in the private and exclusive brand results.

So we feel like we want to make sure that we're in front of that and not chasing it. And we much rather be in a position where we run low or do have to chase product in highly seasonal category. So the plan has a aspect to it. The longer term answer is definitely the speed initiative, because many of our national brand businesses are less weather sensitive. And most of our private and exclusive brand product is actually relatively highly weather-sensitive. So I think longer term, we feel like the speed initiative is the solution.

And in terms of competition, I think, Wes also address that a little bit earlier, we continue to see -- and we expect that both Amazon and generally off-price [ph] space is gaining share. And so to the extent we can, we are really focused on making changes to our business model that would just allow us to compete more effectively. And one of the things that we're probably doing and have a stronger point of view about is the importance of our stores to do that. We still -- we're in a good position in that. We have stores who pass our hurdles and are financially performing but traffic is down. So if we don't get that turnaround at some point, we'll have to be looking at those stores more effectively. But we're piloting these much smaller stores as, perhaps, replacements, so we continue to have points of distribution, but they are less square footage. And then we are trying to utilize them as points of distribution through BOPUS and Ship from Store strategy. So I think Wes and I, Michelle, Sona, Ric Schepp, we all feel like stores are really important part of our future, and we just have to make them work harder for us with customers. And having more presence in markets has an impact on brand awareness, in share awareness, beyond just distributing product and access points.

I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results, and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives, and then we'll take",1096,"Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results, and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives, and then we'll take some of your questions.
Comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter, below our expectations but significantly improved over first quarter results. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 300 basis points comprised of 310 basis point increase in units per transaction and a 10 basis point decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category, while home was the weakest. All other businesses were generally consistent with the company average. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Midwest and West were strongest. The Northeast, South Central and Mid-Atlantic were below the company. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks.
Gross margin increased 53 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over the 140 basis point decrease we saw in the first quarter. The increase was driven by savings in both promotional markdown and permanent clearance markdowns.
Our SG&A decreased $19 million to $986 million for the quarter and deleveraged only 3 basis points on a 2% decline in sales. Our teams continue to aggressively and effectively manage to our payroll as sales trends change versus our plan, but we were unable to leverage those expenses versus last year.
IT and corporate expenses also deleveraged. Partially offsetting these increases were slightly higher credit income and lower variable store cost and marketing expenses. Depreciation expense was essentially flat to last year at $234 million.
Our interest expense decreased $6 million to $78 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefits of last summers refinancing. Our income tax rate was 37.5%. The tax rate decreased approximately 40 basis points from last year as a result of federal tax credits that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $140 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.77. During the quarter, we recorded $128 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $192 million. As you saw on our release, the second quarter charge includes $119 million in future store lease obligations; $23 million in software licenses, which did not align with the strategic vision of our restructured IT leadership team; and $7 million in severance and other costs, which were partially offset by the write-off of $21 million and net lease obligations that were previously recorded on our books.
Of the year-to-date charge, $57 million is noncash write-offs of assets and liabilities that were previously recorded on our books. All of the severance will be paid out within 2 years. The $119 million lease obligation charge represents a discounted value of rents and other lease liabilities under noncancelable lease terms.
Our real estate team was able to terminate leases at 3 of the locations during the quarter. They're actively working with landlords and potential subtenants at the 13 remaining lease locations. Assuming worst-case scenario that we are unable to terminate any additional leases before their maturity, the $119 million will be paid out over the next 13 years. The maximum expected payment in every given -- any given year is less than $10 million. Actual cost reported for the quarter were $18 million higher than the high-end of our prior estimate, all of the overage is due to the write-off to the software licenses. We do not expect material changes -- charges in future periods.
Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, net income increased 5% to $221 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.22 per share. We currently operate 1,150 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.7 million square feet.
We also operate 12 FILA Outlets, which opened during the current quarter. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $234 million from last year, due to the timing of last summer's debt refinancing. As you may recall, we have $317 million from the refinancing proceeds on balance sheet in July of last year that we used to pay off bonds tendered in August.
Year-to-date, we generated almost $450 million in free cash flow, a $525 million[ph] improvement over the first half of last year. I'm very pleased with our inventory initiatives and our ability to decrease inventory dollars per store by 6% from the second quarter of last year despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were 7% lower than the second quarter of last year. Our Accounts Payable as a percent of inventory decreased 182 basis points to 35%. All the decrease is due to lower receipts, especially in late June and in July, which have a larger impact on the AP to inventory ratio than receipts from earlier in the quarter. As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had an extraordinary amount of early arriving receipts, due to improvement times and transit times, after the West Coast port operations returned to normal.
Capital expenditures were $340 million for the spring season, $37 million lower than last year, which included higher beauty spending, as we finished the rollout of our enhanced beauty environment now in all stores and some corporate campus spending as we consolidate space here in Wisconsin.
Weighted average diluted shares were $181 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 181 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on September 21 to shareholders of record on September 7.
After reviewing our results for the spring season, we are updating our guidance to $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, the guidance would be $3.80 to $4 per diluted share.
The guidance includes the following assumptions for the fall season: total sales decrease of 2.6%, up 0.6% to last year; a comp sales decrease of 2% to flat to last year; gross margin rate improvement of approximately 20 to 40 basis points over last year; and SG&A dollar growth of 0.5% to 2% over last year.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

The second quarter was below our expectations in the sales line. May was the weakest month of the quarter. June was aided by warm weather early in the month, along with favorable calendar shifts with Memorial Day falling in fiscal June and Fourth of July moving to fiscal July.
July finished very strong, as we moved our credit event a week closer to Back-to-School, and those businesses, especially juniors, young men's and girls performed extremely well.
Our seasonal businesses in the quarter followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales. A little more color on our sales. Men's was better than the company, with strength in active, young men's, basic and dress clothing and shorts and swimwear. Footwear ran with the company with strength in kids and men's dress casual, and weakness in women's.
Children's showed relative strength in girls and boys, while infants and toddlers was more difficult, as we continue to work on revitalizing our Jumping Beans brand. Women's showed strength in active, intimates and swim, while updated contemporary and classic sportswear continued to remain more difficult.
Accessories continued to be driven by beauty and fine jewelry, with the remainder of the business being challenged. And finally, home trailed the company, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter as both bedding and luggage were strengths.
We did a very good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate increase of 53 basis points was better than our plan due to both better initial markup and lower promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 6%, in line with our expectations.
We continue to expect to make progress on this throughout the year, targeting end of third quarter levels of down mid-single-digits on a per-store basis. Our receipts will be down in the third quarter and slightly up in the fourth quarter, as we bring in more transitional receipts than we did last year with the holiday season.
We are being very conservative in our cold weather categories, as we expect the third quarter to be soft, with the fourth quarter improving versus last year's mild winter.
On the SG&A line, almost every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend less than last year in dollars and significantly less than our plans. I continue to be impressed by the team's agility to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. 
I'd now like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product, on national brands, our first quarter launches of Stride Rite in children's shoes and a relaunched New Balance in the active area continue to pay dividends.
The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 9% comp for the quarter. Our national brands in total were up low single digits, with active and wellness leading the way for the mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a low double-digit comp in the quarter. The active and wellness category itself is now 18% of our total business. Finally, national brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter.
We're incredibly excited to add Under Armour to our active and wellness category in early 2017. We've already established a strong leadership position in the active and wellness area, and adding one of the most sought-after brands to our portfolio of offerings will allow us to project that leadership even more fully. As you know, this area has consistently been one of our fastest-growing categories in the store, and we would expect that adding Under Armour will extend that period of growth, accelerate the rate of growth and attract a new customer to our store at the same time.
We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their trend. One big initiative that we need to take across more of our private and exclusive brands is the need to improve our speed to market.
We started to do this with our SO brand in juniors, and we're achieving double-digit comps this spring on less inventory than last year. Michelle is working with our product development teams to reduce the end-to-end cycle on our private and exclusive brands by 25% on average, and we have a goal of approximately 40% reduction in women's.
This takes the success we have seen in SO with this initiative, and we're rolling out this to Candie's and Juniors as well as urban pipeline in young men's. Misses apparel will be the next area of focus.
Our localization efforts are proving out in 2016, will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our assortments across all stores.
As we exit the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is already localized. We saw a modest lift in the spring season, achieving higher sales and lower inventory per store versus our control groups but would expect the effect to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods by quarter 2 into quarter 3, where localized assortments should have a much bigger impact.
And our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand, with online generated demand achieving a midteens increase, as we expected. We continue to invest in technology and training our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for the time strapped customer.
In the second quarter, the combination of Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store sales reached 21% of total dollar online demand and 23% of total unit online demand, both increasing versus the first quarter.
We do believe we have a big opportunity there, both short and long term, which we think will only continue to amplify the role and relevancy of our brick-and-mortar stores.
And finally, our Kohl's app was downloaded by more than 13.5 million customers, continues to grow in both downloads, but more importantly, usage, particularly aspects like the digital wallet.
On a store-update basis, we opened 12 FILA stores in May and 2 additional Off/Aisle stores in March, in both cases, we're generally pleased with the results and implementing operational changes as we learn from the results.
We'll be opening 6 smaller format stores in the third quarter, adding to the 235,000-foot smaller stores we opened in the first quarter. Even more importantly than in our standard prototype stores, we've seen the importance of flexibility and localization in our offerings, as each trade area is unique due to both small trade area and small store size.
In 2017, we'll be looking for a small number of these stores to open in more populated markets to ascertain the potential and the possible use as a tool to serve trade areas where our full-size stores have too much square footage.
In conclusion, I'm very happy with the efforts the organization has made around rightsizing our inventory and the resulting improvement in merchandise margin and cash flow. We reached our objective, aggressive objective, of reducing inventories from last year by 6% per store at the end of the second quarter. And that will position us well to continue that rightsizing through fall and holiday. I'm also equally pleased with the team's ability to manage expenses down in a tougher sales environment.
We continue to work to create more momentum in our sales trend, and this is our primary focus as we enter the fall and holiday. While the second quarter performance in sales, certainly, improved over the first quarter, we did have declines in foot traffic in our stores generally, and this needs to be reversed to the positive. The key areas of focus and continuing that improvement in sales are, of course, marketing and merchandising.
On the marketing side, we're centered on projecting all of our loyalty components, rewards, Kohl's Cash and credit offers more completely. In our merchandising side, our focus is on improving our speed and agility across all of our businesses, but most importantly, our largest one, women's apparel.
As you heard in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, we're looking to continue to improve on each of our key metrics and to stay conservative in the level of improvement expected.
Thank you. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

On the more sustainability aspect of the comp looking forward, I think, as we sort of alluded to in the call, we're obviously very focused on the 2 most important elements, merchandising and marketing. On the merchandising side, I would say we're going to continue to drive our national brand strategy, in particular continue to amplify the importance of active and wellness because we think that's a trend that is taking hold very strongly. And while we have a good leadership position, I think, expanding the portfolio with Under Armour is going to make a massive difference. We're actually going to invest in the stores across the whole active area to make that area stand out more as part of the launch of Under Armour. And then secondly, in merchandising, we touched on the fact that we know that we have to be faster in our product cycle from beginning to end on our private and exclusive brands. And so we've seen the success in the areas where we piloted, and I think Michelle and the team is focused on expanding that to women's across the board, and then, of course, to the overall store as well. On the marketing side, I think, we touched on probably the most important thing, which is continuing to wrap up all of our loyalty efforts more successfully, so pulling together the credit offers, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards. And I think as we analyze the results of our business over time, we probably have had opportunity there. They often stood alone, and weren't well connected in the communication with the customer. So I think Michelle feels pretty strongly that, that's going to be a major opportunity going forward. So merchandise and marketing are our focus; brands on the national side continue to add them, but drive the ones we have, most importantly, improve the speed around our private and exclusive brands, and then really focus on loyalty as a concept in our marketing."

I can give you a part of the thinking, and Wes can get more specific to the financial aspect. I mean, overall, as you know, we've closed some stores this year, and I think our expectation is we're going to be able to probably understand more about the impact of that on markets and other trade areas inside of markets that might positively benefit from those store closures. I don't expect us to be able to do a thorough analysis to get a good understanding of that until next spring, because we really need to go through the fall and holiday season to analyze that to a great degree. As a result, we honestly don't expect any store closures next year as of right now. The second part of that answer long term is we think that our stores are really important, and as we noted in the call, more and more we're seeing the role and relevancy of the store come to life through being able to use our stores as shipping points for customers as they go online to buy product, but also as pick up points as customers choose the convenience of buying online but picking up in the store, and therefore, avoiding any shipping or time delay as well. And so that number continues to grow, I think, Wes was pretty excited about the fact that it reached 21% in dollars, 23% in units. I expect that at the end of the third quarter, it's going to be even higher. And I would really expect that the end of the fourth quarter is going to be massively higher, just because of the nature of the business. As it relates to specific financials around stores, Wes could give you a good handle on that."

And we can't get those in front of the customers enough and get them to understand what the value of that is. As far as getting them to translate into credit card customers, I think, we've seen some success there. But honestly, we have a big data opportunity to marry the sources of data that we have within the company. There are people that register for our website on Kohls.com that provide us that information. There are people that register on the loyalty profile. We need to marry that information together along with trying to get some income information so we can be able to prescreen those at the front register.

We always have a level of conservatism. Fourth quarter is always very competitive. I think you guys know that the e-commerce business spikes significantly in the fourth quarter. That is a bigger headwind to gross margin, from a shipping cost perspective. So we're still going to see more improvement in the fourth quarter last year given our performance. We expect to see some improvement in the third quarter, but I think it's just a level of conservatism not knowing what's ahead of us. But from an inventory management perspective, we're going to hit those numbers. The team is really focused on bringing those inventory levels down.

That will include updating and amplifying the rest of active and wellness in addition. There aren't any major brands that are going away at all.

And then, I guess, secondly to that is obviously you're focusing on private and exclusive, but some of the other chatter on the industry has been some of the national brands trying to integrate more deeply with the retailers to see if they can speed up in that wholesaler-retailer relationship. Is there any opportunity to do that, as you look beyond what you'll be able to do on the private label side?"

And we know the elements of the cycle from design all the way through delivery that we can take time out of on. And we piloted and experimented and seen the results. I mean, I think, frankly, Michelle would tell you that she believes the metric that will improve, if we effectively scale up speed beyond where it's been tested and piloted so far, will be sales. Yes, there's a corresponding positive that comes with more effective inventory, and therefore, if sales improve, as you know, margins on private brands are quite a bit higher, and so there's a possible margin implication that would be to the positive as well. But I think that the number she is looking to change the trend line on, is implement speed in order to have more relevant product, which will sell better, turn a little faster and indirectly, I think, raise our merchandise margin because we'll just be doing better in private brands."

There's definitely editing opportunities in our private brand, and when I say private brand, I mean including our exclusive brand portfolio.

And I think that the factors that will impact that will be how quickly we can scale up the speed initiative will probably tell us pretty quickly which of the brands benefit the most from that, and therefore, will point us in the right direction in terms of downsizing and then eliminating others. We definitely know that, that's an opportunity for us. We've broadened the base of private and exclusive brands that we have to offer over the last 5 years quite substantially. And I think Michelle feels like there's a chance to tighten it up. Our big private brands though, the billion-dollar-plus brands of SONOMA and Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9, they're not going away. And those are the ones that probably will benefit the most. There is always good things and bad things in the private and exclusive brand results. But generally, the really good things have been the brands like SO that have had the speed initiative applied. And the things that have struggled more -- and also things like SONOMA where we've kind of relaunched it. And the things that have struggled more are those brands where we haven't had any adoption of the speed initiative. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it."

So we feel like we want to make sure that we're in front of that and not chasing it. And we much rather be in a position where we run low or do have to chase product in highly seasonal categories. So the plan has that aspect to it. The longer term answer is definitely the speed initiative, because many of our national brand businesses are less weather sensitive. And most of our private and exclusive brand product is actually relatively highly weather-sensitive. So I think longer term, we feel like the speed initiative is the solution.

We have modest improvement in our business and in traffic, but it's still negative. So until such time as we can implement these merchandising and marketing changes, we don't want to plan for traffic to turn positive. And so as I said earlier on the call, we're planning traffic to be lower than sales in the near term. And in terms of competition, I think, Wes also address that a little bit earlier, we continue to see -- and we expect that both Amazon and generally the off-price space is gaining share. And so to the extent we can, we are really focused on making changes to our business model that would just allow us to compete more effectively. And one of the things that we're probably doing and have a stronger point of view about is the importance of our stores to do that. We still -- we're in a good position in that we have stores who pass our hurdles and are financially performing but traffic is down. So if we don't get that turned around at some point, we'll have to be looking at those stores more effectively. But we're piloting these much smaller stores as, perhaps, replacements, so we continue to have points of distribution, but they are less square footage. And then we are trying to utilize them as points of distribution through BOPUS and Ship from Store strategy. So I think Wes and I, Michelle, Sona, Ric Schepp, we all feel like stores are really important part of our future, and we just have to make them work harder for us with customers. And having more presence in markets has an impact on brand awareness, in share awareness, beyond just distributing product and access points.

With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results, and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives, and then we'll take some of your questions.
Comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter, below our expectations but significantly improved over first quarter results. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 300 basis points comprised of 310 basis point increase in units per transaction and a 10 basis point decrease in average unit retail.
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category, while home was the weakest. All other businesses were generally consistent with the company average. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Midwest and West were strongest. The Northeast, South Central and Mid-Atlantic were below the company. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks.
Gross margin increased 53 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over the 140 basis point decrease we saw in the first quarter. The increase was driven by savings in both promotional markdown and permanent clearance markdowns.
Our SG&A decreased $19 million to $986 million for the quarter and deleveraged only 3 basis points on a 2% decline in sales. Our teams continue to aggressively and effectively manage to our payroll as sales trends change versus our plan, but we were unable to leverage those expenses versus last year.
IT and corporate expenses also deleveraged. Partially offsetting these increases were slightly higher credit income and lower variable store cost and marketing expenses. Depreciation expense was essentially flat to last year at $234 million.
Our interest expense decreased $6 million to $78 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefits of last summers refinancing. Our income tax rate was 37.5%. The tax rate decreased approximately 40 basis points from last year as a result of federal tax credits that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $140 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.77. During the quarter, we recorded $128 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $192 million. As you saw on our release, the second quarter charge includes $119 million in future store lease obligations; $23 million in software licenses, which did not align with the strategic vision of our restructured IT leadership team; and $7 million in severance and other costs, which were partially offset by the write-off of $21 million and net lease obligations that were previously recorded on our books.
Of the year-to-date charge, $57 million is noncash write-offs of assets and liabilities that were previously recorded on our books. All of the severance will be paid out within 2 years. The $119 million lease obligation charge represents a discounted value of rents and other lease liabilities under noncancelable lease terms.
Our real estate team was able to terminate leases at 3 of the locations during the quarter. They're actively working with landlords and potential subtenants at the 13 remaining lease locations. Assuming worst-case scenario that we are unable to terminate any additional leases before their maturity, the $119 million will be paid out over the next 13 years. The maximum expected payment in every given -- any given year is less than $10 million. Actual cost reported for the quarter were $18 million higher than the high-end of our prior estimate, all of the overage is due to the write-off to the software licenses. We do not expect material changes -- charges in future periods.
Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, net income increased 5% to $221 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.22 per share. We currently operate 1,150 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.7 million square feet.
We also operate 12 FILA Outlets, which opened during the current quarter. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $234 million from last year, due to the timing of last summer's debt refinancing. As you may recall, we have $317 million from the refinancing proceeds on balance sheet in July of last year that we used to pay off bonds tendered in August.
Year-to-date, we generated almost $450 million in free cash flow, a $525 million [ph] improvement over the first half of last year. I'm very pleased with our inventory initiatives and our ability to decrease inventory dollars per store by 6% from the second quarter of last year despite the challenging sales environment.
Units per store were 7% lower than the second quarter of last year. Our Accounts Payable as a percent of inventory decreased 182 basis points to 35%. All the decrease is due to lower receipts, especially in late June and in July, which have a larger impact on the AP to inventory ratio than receipts from earlier in the quarter. As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had an extraordinary amount of early arriving receipts, due to improvement times and transit times, after the West Coast port operations returned to normal.
Capital expenditures were $340 million for the spring season, $37 million lower than last year, which included higher beauty spending, as we finished the rollout of our enhanced beauty environment now in all stores and some corporate campus spending as we consolidate space here in Wisconsin.
Weighted average diluted shares were $181 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 181 million shares of stock outstanding.
On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on September 21 to shareholders of record on September 7.
After reviewing our results for the spring season, we are updating our guidance to $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, the guidance would be $3.80 to $4 per diluted share.
The guidance includes the following assumptions for the fall season: total sales decrease of 2.6%, up 0.6% to last year; a comp sales decrease of 2% to flat to last year; gross margin rate improvement of approximately 20 to 40 basis points over last year; and SG&A dollar growth of 0.5% to 2% over last year.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

The second quarter was below our expectations in the sales line. May was the weakest month of the quarter. June was aided by warm weather early in the month, along with favorable calendar shifts with Memorial Day falling in fiscal June and Fourth of July moving to fiscal July.
July finished very strong, as we moved our credit event a week closer to Back-to-School, and those businesses, especially juniors, young men's and girls performed extremely well.
Our seasonal businesses in the quarter followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales. A little more color on our sales. Men's was better than the company, with strength in active, young men's, basic and dress clothing and shorts and swimwear. Footwear ran with the company with strength in kids and men's dress casual, and weakness in women's.
Children's showed relative strength in girls and boys, while infants and toddlers was more difficult, as we continue to work on revitalizing our Jumping Beans brand. Women's showed strength in active, intimates and swim, while updated contemporary and classic sportswear continued to remain more difficult.
Accessories continued to be driven by beauty and fine jewelry, with the remainder of the business being challenged. And finally, home trailed the company, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter as both bedding and luggage were strengths.
We did a very good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate increase of 53 basis points was better than our plan due to both better initial markup and lower promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 6%, in line with our expectations.
We continue to expect to make progress on this throughout the year, targeting end of third quarter levels of down mid-single-digits on a per-store basis. Our receipts will be down in the third quarter and slightly up in the fourth quarter, as we bring in more transitional receipts than we did last year with the holiday season.
We are being very conservative in our cold weather categories, as we expect the third quarter to be soft, with the fourth quarter improving versus last year's mild winter.
On the SG&A line, almost every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend less than last year in dollars and significantly less than our plans. I continue to be impressed by the team's agility to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment. 
I'd now like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product, on national brands, our first quarter launches of Stride Rite in children's shoes and a relaunched New Balance in the active area continue to pay dividends.
The launch of Stride Rite helped kid's shoes to outperform and New Balance achieved a 9% comp for the quarter. Our national brands in total were up low single digits, with active and wellness leading the way for the mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a low double-digit comp in the quarter. The active and wellness category itself is now 18% of our total business. Finally, national brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter.
We're incredibly excited to add Under Armour to our active and wellness category in early 2017. We've already established a strong leadership position in the active and wellness area, and adding one of the most sought-after brands to our portfolio of offerings will allow us to project that leadership even more fully. As you know, this area has consistently been one of our fastest-growing categories in the store, and we would expect that adding Under Armour will extend that period of growth, accelerate the rate of growth and attract a new customer to our store at the same time.
We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both men's and women's as they've seen improvements versus their trend. One big initiative that we need to take across more of our private and exclusive brands is the need to improve our speed to market.
We started to do this with our SO brand in juniors, and we're achieving double-digit comps this spring on less inventory than last year. Michelle is working with our product development teams to reduce the end-to-end cycle on our private and exclusive brands by 25% on average, and we have a goal of approximately 40% reduction in women's.
This takes the success we have seen in SO with this initiative, and we're rolling out this to Candie's and Juniors as well as urban pipeline in young men's. Misses apparel will be the next area of focus.
Our localization efforts are proving out in 2016, will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our assortments across all stores.
As we exit the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is already localized. We saw a modest lift in the spring season, achieving higher sales and lower inventory per store versus our control groups but would expect the effect to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods by quarter 2 into quarter 3, where localized assortments should have a much bigger impact.
And our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand, with online generated demand achieving a midteens increase, as we expected. We continue to invest in technology and training our stores to allow us to Ship from Store and provide Buy Online, Pick Up In Store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for the time strapped customer.
In the second quarter, the combination of Ship from Store and Buy Online, Pick Up In Store sales reached 21% of total dollar online demand and 23% of total unit online demand, both increasing versus the first quarter.
We do believe we have a big opportunity there, both short and long term, which we think will only continue to amplify the role and relevancy of our brick-and-mortar stores.
And finally, our Kohl's app was downloaded by more than 13.5 million customers, continues to grow in both downloads, but more importantly, usage, particularly aspects like the digital wallet.
On a store-update basis, we opened 12 FILA stores in May and 2 additional Off/Aisle stores in March, in both cases, we're generally pleased with the results and implementing operational changes as we learn from the results.
We'll be opening 6 smaller format stores in the third quarter, adding to the 235,000-foot smaller stores we opened in the first quarter. Even more importantly than in our standard prototype stores, we've seen the importance of flexibility and localization in our offerings, as each trade area is unique due to both small trade area and small store size.
In 2017, we'll be looking for a small number of these stores to open in more populated markets to ascertain the potential and the possible use as a tool to serve trade areas where our full-size stores have too much square footage.
In conclusion, I'm very happy with the efforts the organization has made around rightsizing our inventory and the resulting improvement in merchandise margin and cash flow. We reached our objective, aggressive objective, of reducing inventories from last year by 6% per store at the end of the second quarter. And that will position us well to continue that rightsizing through fall and holiday. I'm also equally pleased with the team's ability to manage expenses down in a tougher sales environment.
We continue to work to create more momentum in our sales trend, and this is our primary focus as we enter the fall and holiday. While the second quarter performance in sales, certainly, improved over the first quarter, we did have declines in foot traffic in our stores generally, and this needs to be reversed to the positive. The key areas of focus and continuing that improvement in sales are, of course, marketing and merchandising.
On the marketing side, we're centered on projecting all of our loyalty components, rewards, Kohl's Cash and credit offers more completely. In our merchandising side, our focus is on improving our speed and agility across all of our businesses, but most importantly, our largest one, women's apparel.
As you heard in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, we're looking to continue to improve on each of our key metrics and to stay conservative in the level of improvement expected.
Thank you. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

On the more sustainability aspect of the comp looking forward, I think, as we sort of alluded to in the call, we're obviously very focused on the 2 most important elements, merchandising and marketing. On the merchandising side, I would say we're going to continue to drive our national brand strategy, in particular continue to amplify the importance of active and wellness because we think that's a trend that is taking hold very strongly. And while we have a good leadership position, I think, expanding the portfolio with Under Armour is going to make a massive difference. We're actually going to invest in the stores across the whole active area to make that area stand out more as part of the launch of Under Armour. And then secondly, in merchandising, we touched on the fact that we know that we have to be faster in our product cycle from beginning to end on our private and exclusive brands. And so we've seen the success in the areas where we piloted, and I think Michelle and the team is focused on expanding that to women's across the board, and then, of course, to the overall store as well. On the marketing side, I think, we touched on probably the most important thing, which is continuing to wrap up all of our loyalty efforts more successfully, so pulling together the credit offers, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards. And I think as we analyze the results of our business over time, we probably have had opportunity there. They often stood alone, and weren't well connected in the communication with the customer. So I think Michelle feels pretty strongly that, that's going to be a major opportunity going forward. So merchandise and marketing are our focus; brands on the national side continue to add them, but drive the ones we have, most importantly, improve the speed around our private and exclusive brands, and then really focus on loyalty as a concept in our marketing."

I don't expect us to be able to do a thorough analysis to get a good understanding of that until next spring, because we really need to go through the fall and holiday season to analyze that to a great degree. As a result, we honestly don't expect any store closures next year as of right now. The second part of that answer long term is we think that our stores are really important, and as we noted in the call, more and more we're seeing the role and relevancy of the store come to life through being able to use our stores as shipping points for customers as they go online to buy product, but also as pick up points as customers choose the convenience of buying online but picking up in the store, and therefore, avoiding any shipping or time delay as well. And so that number continues to grow, I think, Wes was pretty excited about the fact that it reached 21% in dollars, 23% in units. I expect that at the end of the third quarter, it's going to be even higher. And I would really expect that the end of the fourth quarter is going to be massively higher, just because of the nature of the business.

As far as getting them to translate into credit card customers, I think, we've seen some success there. But honestly, we have a big data opportunity to marry the sources of data that we have within the company. There are people that register for our website on Kohls.com that provide us that information. There are people that register on the loyalty profile.

The Ship from Store option for us makes us competitive with Amazon Prime and in terms of we can get the shipment to the persons house in less than 2 days about 90-some percent of the time. So speed is a big initiative from that perspective. But if we had to ship in 2 packages, that's a problem.

One is, and I think Wes may have mentioned it, if not, I'll make sure you know. As we look into the fall and holiday, we definitely are planning, we planned down seasonal categories, substantially more than the overall business. So we feel like we want to make sure that we're in front of that and not chasing it. And we much rather be in a position where we run low or do have to chase product in highly seasonal categories. So the plan has that aspect to it. The longer term answer is definitely the speed initiative, because many of our national brand businesses are less weather sensitive. And most of our private and exclusive brand product is actually relatively highly weather-sensitive. So I think longer term, we feel like the speed initiative is the solution. We've positioned private and exclusive brands, I think, Wes, on an inventory basis really well going into the fall and holiday, we are down."

We have modest improvement in our business and in traffic, but it's still negative. So until such time as we can implement these merchandising and marketing changes, we don't want to plan for traffic to turn positive. And so as I said earlier on the call, we're planning traffic to be lower than sales in the near term. And in terms of competition, I think, Wes also address that a little bit earlier, we continue to see -- and we expect that both Amazon and generally the off-price space is gaining share. And so to the extent we can, we are really focused on making changes to our business model that would just allow us to compete more effectively. And one of the things that we're probably doing and have a stronger point of view about is the importance of our stores to do that. We still -- we're in a good position in that we have stores who pass our hurdles and are financially performing but traffic is down. So if we don't get that turned around at some point, we'll have to be looking at those stores more effectively. But we're piloting these much smaller stores as, perhaps, replacements, so we continue to have points of distribution, but they are less square footage. And then we are trying to utilize them as points of distribution through BOPUS and Ship from Store strategy. So I think Wes and I, Michelle, Sona, Ric Schepp, we all feel like stores are really important part of our future, and we just have to make them work harder for us with customers. And having more presence in markets has an impact on brand awareness, in share awareness, beyond just distributing product and access points. It just makes you a more important competitor in any particular market across the country."

I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming Holiday season. We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- and payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be, as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring cost that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to our spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say that we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw a progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which has encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard at all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness on our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount for new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops on one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And any notable pressures we should be thinking about beyond e-commerce?"

I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get in the fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization is a key enabler because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, a, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity.

So it's a combination of absolutely reducing the receipts and then how we flow the merchandise. As Kevin mentioned, that speed initiative is going to be a big factor.

But I do think that by the time we get to February, we definitely owe you and give you some indication of what we are seeing from the holding the trade area sales and other stores and whether or not it's a positive thing are not from market share perspective. So too early, I wouldn't want to share it but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll give us some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happen in the third quarter was we opened up 6 new small 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we opened, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term prospects for us, both to get us in the trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work. But also just in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing on a volume than they used to do, there is an operative for us the scale down the size of the store because we do think that, long-term, a big positive for us. You know we said and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative and it's really, could be very good for us. And certainly the early indications are positive."

If you just did the calculation for the third quarter, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store as a percent of our total digital demand was not as high as we had the hoped for. We we're not trying to dodge that, that's a fact. But what we've focused all year on the fourth quarter because we know that actually with a big opportunity presents itself. And the way we're looking at it first is really to have provided sort of best-in-class experience. And that starts with the enablers on customers devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There are some operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that it will actually drive the percentage to where we needed to be. I don't think we need to get at this point at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. I think if we make the experience phenomenal, I think, it's going to be really, really good. And we seem to be overlooking some of the questions the positive impact I think, also of Ship from Store because again, we've put a stake in the ground to say our store portfolio is really important, and we believe in it and we're going to amplify it. And amplify it is use our stores for all aspects of customer experience, which includes not just Buy Online, Pick Up In Store but also our ability to Ship from Store. And so I think both of those for the fourth quarter are going to be phenomenal. I think we'll be talking in February about really good indices on both of those strategies."

So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's help from a speeding capacity perspective but we have to continue to help give the associates the tools to fund all the items in that order. So we don't end up having to sit in a partial order to another store, that's critical. So we can could you to make progress there. I think you'll see the profitability improve.

I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming Holiday season. We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- and payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be, as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring cost that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to our spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say that we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw a progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which has encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard at all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness on our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount for new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops on one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And any notable pressures we should be thinking about beyond e-commerce?"

I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get in the fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization is a key enabler because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, a, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity. Yes, we agree, but it's these longer-term things that I think you want to focus on."

So the speed initiative is a key enabler of that because it affects our proprietary brands, which is 50% of our business. Localization is a key enabler because it gets you assortments that need to be in the right store in the right store. And those are the more permanent things. I think everything we're seeing, which is there are plenty of examples in the company, where receipts inventory were pulled way back and sales were actually up, gives us sort of the sample size in the examples to point other areas to say to them, ""Hey, this works as long it's a permanent process change.""

People continue to shop and explore and search more online increasingly, obviously, more with their smartphone than anything else. And we see that in all of our metrics and all of our trends. I would say we are seeing increasingly a trend towards customers using that information to transact in our stores, which I think would -- if that were to continue over a long period of time and grow, that would be a really good thing for us. Because, as you know, one of our key initiatives is to amplify the importance of our store base, and we have a substantial store base. So that would be a great trend if it continued. But I think overall, people continued to use the digital devices that they have to do all of the things that make their shopping easier for them. From a door fleet perspective, I think there's 2 things that happen in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early, I think for us, to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding, the trade area sales in other stores and whether or not it's a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll you some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up 6 new, small, 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term plusses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us. You know we've said, and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative, and it's early, could be very good for us. And certainly, the early indications are positive."

From a gross margin perspective, I mean, very simply, we're trying get back 50 basis points a year of merchandise margin improvement through inventory initiatives. And I'm especially excited about the speed initiative because that should be incremental to the 50 basis points, which should just be able to occur from getting our inventories to the right level. And then -- but that's going to be offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from e-commerce, assuming that it continues to grow at the kind of the rate that we think it is, in that midteens kind of a range. So from a modeling perspective, if you're looking at a multiyear model or thinking about how we're going to do 20 basis points a year improvement, is probably the best, I think, that we'll be able to accomplish absent improvement in comps from where we're running today.

That -- I definitely don't want to get ahead of myself in the 35,000 square foot stores. We've been open for now, I guess, 6 weeks or 7 weeks. But you know that the strategy there had 2 prongs to it. One was pretty straightforward, which is it gives us new points of distribution in smaller markets where we can't make the economics of a larger store work and makes our ability to reach customers more effective. You know that we've put a stake in the ground that brick and mortar is really important as an omnichannel retailer, both to have a place in the customers' mind, but also as a point of distribution. So that's one.

And it's all positive right now, Richard. I just -- I think we just need a little more time to give you quality."

So unlike, let's say, women's apparel, in children's wear, we compete much more aggressively against retailers like Walmart and like Target. So I mean, I think our judgment is that it always comes back to product. Our prices are great in children's wear, in particular, they're great in Jumping Beans. And you're right, Jumping Beans as a brand has been far short of our expectation. But everything always comes back to product, and I think Michelle would tell you that, that's where we need to put our effort, is to give customers better choices and product, to time them from a speed perspective more effectively so they flow more evenly into the store. And more localized so they're more appropriate based on where the store is. I think those are the 3 big things."

We there's -- we're not trying to dodge that, that's a fact. But we've focused all year on the fourth quarter because we know that's actually when the big opportunity presents itself. And the way we're looking at it first is really to have provided sort of best-in-class experience. And that starts with the enablers on customers' devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There's all kinds of operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that will actually drive the percentage to where we need it to be. I don't think we need to get, at this point, at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. I think if we make the experience phenomenal, I think it's going to be really, really good.

It's not increasing, it's just, as the percentage of the business goes forward, our cost per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers, it's especially important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75. So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's help from a speeding capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give the associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store, that's critical. So we can continue to make progress there. I think you'll see the profitability improve. Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-com, they were flat, so that continues to -- obviously, their sales are much better than brick-and-mortar. So we continue to get a turn improvement from that perspective. So I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-com side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down. The EFC 5 that we're opening next year is going to be 3x as productive as our existing EFC. So we've got a lot of things in the hopper that are going to help us improve that profitability.

We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- and payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be, as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring cost that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to our spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say that we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw a progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which has encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard at all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness on our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount for new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops on one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Just hoping to get a better sense of some of the puts and takes there. And then as we look into Q4 and even Q1, comparison's obviously quite a bit easier from a merch margin perspective, and inventory is down 10%. So I guess the bull case in gross margin can be quite strong, but what other factors should we be taking into consideration as we model that for the next couple of quarters? And any notable pressures we should be thinking about beyond e-commerce?"

So",213,"Yes, we certainly think that we'll have opportunity improve more in the fourth quarter, and as you mentioned, especially in the first quarter next year. I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get in the fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, a, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity.

So the speed initiative is a key enabler of that because it affects our proprietary brands, which is 50% of our business. Localization is a key enabler because it gets you assortments that need to be in the right store in the right store. And those are the more permanent things. I think everything we're seeing, which is there are plenty of examples in the company, where receipts inventory were pulled way back and sales were actually up, gives us sort of the sample size in the examples to point other areas to say to them, ""Hey, this works as long it's a permanent process change.""

It's Kevin, Oliver. I mean, from a volatility perspective, looking backwards to the weak September, there's always things when you look in hindsight that you can say, ""Had we done this differently from a marketing standpoint, we might have done better overall."" And certainly there were a couple of things, particularly they were around the Labor Day holiday, that we look back at and say, ""We probably would have done them differently had we known."" But they were in form, based on testing and piloting we have done, so I don't second guess it. And I think over time, we'll continue to make improvements on that. We are always going to be affected by the seasonality of weather at a point in time. We just are. I mean, we're heavily penetrated in apparel. We have a customer who shops on a wear now basis for that clothing and accessories. And so we're more vulnerable than some of our competition, both negatively but also positively when it's good. I do think Michelle's made, with her merchandising team, some big changes to lessen the dependence on cold weather as a driver. And as I said, both the localization initiative and the speed initiative are key components of that because they put us in a position to better depend upon other classifications within the apparel business to drive our overall business over time. But we're still going to always be vulnerable, as I said, both on the negative side and on the positive side, on weather. I do think, though, it's going to lessen, and we see it lessening."

People continue to shop and explore and search more online increasingly, obviously, more with their smartphone than anything else. And we see that in all of our metrics and all of our trends. I would say we are seeing increasingly a trend towards customers using that information to transact in our stores, which I think would -- if that were to continue over a long period of time and grow, that would be a really good thing for us. Because, as you know, one of our key initiatives is to amplify the importance of our store base, and we have a substantial store base. So that would be a great trend if it continued. But I think overall, people continued to use the digital devices that they have to do all of the things that make their shopping easier for them. From a door fleet perspective, I think there's 2 things that happen in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early, I think for us, to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding, the trade area sales in other stores and whether or not it's a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll you some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up 6 new, small, 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term plusses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us. You know we've said, and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative, and it's early, could be very good for us. And certainly, the early indications are positive."

We there's -- we're not trying to dodge that, that's a fact. But we've focused all year on the fourth quarter because we know that's actually when the big opportunity presents itself.

And that starts with the enablers on customers' devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There's all kinds of operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that will actually drive the percentage to where we need it to be. I don't think we need to get, at this point, at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store.

It's not increasing, it's just, as the percentage of the business goes forward, our cost per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers, it's especially important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75. So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's help from a speeding capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give the associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store, that's critical. So we can continue to make progress there. I think you'll see the profitability improve. Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-com, they were flat, so that continues to -- obviously, their sales are much better than brick-and-mortar. So we continue to get a turn improvement from that perspective. So I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-com side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down.

We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line-of-business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring costs that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but",792,"Thanks, Wes. We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but that was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which is encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly-improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday, though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly-recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard in all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness in our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount of new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops in one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 basis to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get into fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization is a key enabler because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, hey, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity.

Localization is a key enabler because it gets the assortments that need to be in the right store, in the right store. And those are the more permanent things.

And so that does allow us to time, and as I said, personalize many of those efforts more effectively. So it's going to be an intense holiday season. I don't think there's anything new about that, and there's nothing special about that from a year-over-year standpoint.

It's Kevin, Oliver. I mean, from a volatility perspective, looking backwards to the weak September, there's always things when you look in hindsight that you can say, ""Had we done this differently from a marketing standpoint, we might have done better overall."" And certainly there were a couple of things, particularly around the Labor Day holiday, that we look back at and say, ""We probably would have done them differently had we known."" But they were informed, based on testing and piloting we had done, so I don't second-guess it. And I think over time, we'll continue to make improvements on that. We are always going to be affected by the seasonality of weather at a point in time. We just are. I mean, we're heavily penetrated in apparel. We have a customer who shops on a wear-now basis for that clothing and accessories. And so we're more vulnerable than some of our competition, both negatively but also positively when it's good. I do think Michelle's made, with her merchandising team, some big changes to lessen the dependence on cold weather as a driver. And as I said, both the localization initiative and the speed initiative are key components of that because they put us in a position to better depend upon other classifications within the apparel business to drive our overall business over time. But we're still going to always be vulnerable, as I said, both on the negative side and on the positive side, on weather. I do think, though, it's going to lessen, and we see it lessening."

People continue to shop and explore and search more online increasingly, obviously, more with their smartphone than anything else. And we see that in all of our metrics and all of our trends.

Because, as you know, one of our key initiatives is to amplify the importance of our store base, and we have a substantial store base. So that would be a great trend if it continued. But I think overall, people continue to use the digital devices that they have to do all the things that make their shopping easier for them. From a door fleet perspective, I think there's 2 things that happened in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early, I think, for us to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding, the trade area sales in other stores and whether or not it was a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll you some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up 6 new, small, 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term plusses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us. You know we've said, and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative, and it's early, could be very good for us.

But I actually think the better metric to look at is the percentage of cash flow. We've done a really good job this year, and I expect us to be able to generate about $1 billion in free cash flow after CapEx expenditures.

It's not increasing, it's just, as the percentage of the business goes forward, our costs per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers. It's especially important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75. So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's helped from a speeding capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store; that's critical. So if we can continue to make progress there, I think you'll see the profitability improve. Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-com, they were flat, so that continues to -- obviously, their sales are much better than brick-and-mortar. So we continue to get a turn improvement from that perspective. So I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-com side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down. The EFC 5 that we're opening next year is going to be 3x as productive as our existing EFC. So we've got a lot of things in the hopper that are going to help us improve that profitability. 
Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it. I'll be available for calls a little bit later. Thanks."

61243,408630619,1083982,"Kohl's Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Kohl's Corporation","Executives","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming holiday",855,"Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming holiday season. We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line-of-business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring costs that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but that was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which is encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly-improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday, though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly-recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard in all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness in our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount of new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops in one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And then as we look into Q4 and even Q1, comparison's obviously quite a bit easier from a merch margin perspective, and inventory is down 10%. So I guess the bull case in gross margin could be quite strong, but what other factors should we be taking into consideration as we model that for the next couple of quarters? And any notable pressures we should be thinking about beyond e-commerce?"

I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 basis to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get into fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization is a key enabler because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, hey, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity. Yes, we agree, but it's these longer-term things that I think you want to focus on."

So it's not about pulling our inventories down, we did 9% at a point in time; it's about a permanent change to the way we approach delivering receipts over a long period of time.

Localization is a key enabler because it gets the assortments that need to be in the right store, in the right store. And those are the more permanent things. I think everything we're seeing, which is there are plenty of examples in the company, where receipts inventory were pulled way back and sales were actually up, gives us sort of the sample size in the examples to point other areas to say to them, ""Hey, this works as long it's a permanent process change.""

I mean, from a volatility perspective, looking backwards to the weak September, there's always things when you look in hindsight that you can say, ""Had we done this differently from a marketing standpoint, we might have done better overall.""

But they were informed, based on testing and piloting we had done, so I don't second-guess it. And I think over time, we'll continue to make improvements on that. We are always going to be affected by the seasonality of weather at a point in time. We just are. I mean, we're heavily penetrated in apparel. We have a customer who shops on a wear-now basis for that clothing and accessories. And so we're more vulnerable than some of our competition, both negatively but also positively when it's good. I do think Michelle's made, with her merchandising team, some big changes to lessen the dependence on cold weather as a driver. And as I said, both the localization initiative and the speed initiative are key components of that because they put us in a position to better depend upon other classifications within the apparel business to drive our overall business over time. But we're still going to always be vulnerable, as I said, both on the negative side and on the positive side, on weather. I do think, though, it's going to lessen, and we see it lessening."

But I think overall, people continue to use the digital devices that they have to do all the things that make their shopping easier for them. From a door fleet perspective, I think there's 2 things that happened in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early, I think, for us to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding, the trade area sales in other stores and whether or not it was a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll you some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up 6 new, small, 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term plusses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us. You know we've said, and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative, and it's early, could be very good for us.

From a gross margin perspective, I mean, very simply, we're trying get back 50 basis points a year of merchandise margin improvement through inventory initiatives. And I'm especially excited about the speed initiative because that should be incremental to the 50 basis points, which should just be able to occur from getting our inventories to the right level. And then -- but that's going to be offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from e-commerce, assuming that it continues to grow at the kind of the rate that we think it is, in that midteens kind of a range. So from a modeling perspective, if you're looking at a multiyear model or thinking about how we're going to do, 20 basis points a year improvement is probably the best, I think, that we'll be able to accomplish, absent improvement in comps from where we're running today.

If you just did the calculation for the third quarter, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store as a percent of our total digital demand was not as high as we had hoped for. We there's -- we're not trying to dodge that, that's a fact. But we've been focused all year on the fourth quarter because we know that's actually when the big opportunity presents itself. And the way we're looking at it first is really to have provided sort of best-in-class experience. And that starts with the enablers on customers' devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There's all kinds of operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that will actually drive the percentage to where we need it to be. I don't think we need to get, at this point, at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider, to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. I think if we make the experience phenomenal, I think it's going to be really, really good. And we seem to be overlooking, in some of the questions, the positive impact I think also of Ship from Store. Because again, we've put a stake in the ground to say our store portfolio is really important and we believe in it and we're going to amplify it. And the way we're going to amplify it is use our stores for all aspects of customer experience, which include not just Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, but also our ability to ship from store. And so I think both of those for the fourth quarter are going to be phenomenal. I think we'll be talking in February about really good indices on both of those strategies."

It's not increasing, it's just, as the percentage of the business goes forward, our costs per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers. It's especially important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75. So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's helped from a speeding capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store; that's critical. So if we can continue to make progress there, I think you'll see the profitability improve. Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-com, they were flat, so that continues to -- obviously, their sales are much better than brick-and-mortar. So we continue to get a turn improvement from that perspective. So I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-com side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down. The EFC 5 that we're opening next year is going to be 3x as productive as our existing EFC. So we've got a lot of things in the hopper that are going to help us improve that profitability.

I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming holiday season. We'll then open up the call to your questions. 
Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail. 
From a line-of-business perspective, men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and Accessories were the weakest. 
On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional sales on -- details on sales in his prepared remarks. 
Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points, but was offset primarily by shipping cost. 
SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. 
Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against their internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage, but our store fixed payroll -- payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses did not leverage during the quarter. 
Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be as expected, around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand, as well as the timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. 
We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year. Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores' closures. 
Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures, as well as the store closures. 
Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income. Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. 
During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring costs that were recorded earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere, as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes. 
Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance cost last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share. 
We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened 6 Kohl's stores and closed 1 store. All of our new stores are in our new mall store format. We also operate 12 Fila outlets and 3 Off/Aisle centers. 
We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital, especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date, we generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million improvement over the first 9 months of last year. 
We have made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP-to-inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%. 
Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to spending for our 5th e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. 
Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion. 
Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other cost, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results."

We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but that was followed by a very weak month of September selling period. 
I'm happy to say we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw progressive sequential improvement throughout the month, as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which is encouraging as we enter the holiday season. 
Looking at our sales by business. Men's was the strongest business, with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. 
Home was consistent with the company, however, home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season. 
Women's was slightly below the company but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. 
Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans. And Accessories underperformed the company. 
Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. 
Overall, our women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season. 
The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers, such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales. 
Unseasonable weather as we experienced in September will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories on less inventory versus non-localized categories. 
I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year 1 of a 3-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory, and as a result, had significantly-improved sell-throughs. 
Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open-to-buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about 1/3 of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores and keep our assortments fresh. 
I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday, though, we're also excited to offer the American girl doll of the year, Koolaburra by UGG. And our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly-recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online. 
From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. 
On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard in all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition. 
In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness in our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount of new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. 
Whether she shops in one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points. Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 basis to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis due to mix of business, and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get into fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick-and-mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost. And we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 to 40 basis points for the season."

And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization is a key enabler because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say, than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, hey, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter 4, quarter 1 next year -- last year, therefore, you should have a big opportunity. Yes, we agree, but it's these longer-term things that I think you want to focus on."

We are always going to be affected by the seasonality of weather at a point in time. We just are. I mean, we're heavily penetrated in apparel. We have a customer who shops on a wear-now basis for that clothing and accessories. And so we're more vulnerable than some of our competition, both negatively but also positively when it's good. I do think Michelle's made, with her merchandising team, some big changes to lessen the dependence on cold weather as a driver.

People continue to shop and explore and search more online increasingly, obviously, more with their smartphone than anything else. And we see that in all of our metrics and all of our trends. I would say we are seeing increasingly a trend towards customers using that information to transact in our stores, which I think would -- if that were to continue over a long period of time and grow, that would be a really good thing for us. Because, as you know, one of our key initiatives is to amplify the importance of our store base, and we have a substantial store base. So that would be a great trend if it continued. But I think overall, people continue to use the digital devices that they have to do all the things that make their shopping easier for them. From a door fleet perspective, I think there's 2 things that happened in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early, I think, for us to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding, the trade area sales in other stores and whether or not it was a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll you some indication of the impact of that. The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up 6 new, small, 35,000 square foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term plusses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us. You know we've said, and I think Wes agrees, having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative, and it's early, could be very good for us. And certainly, the early indications are positive."

From a gross margin perspective, I mean, very simply, we're trying get back 50 basis points a year of merchandise margin improvement through inventory initiatives. And I'm especially excited about the speed initiative because that should be incremental to the 50 basis points, which should just be able to occur from getting our inventories to the right level. And then -- but that's going to be offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from e-commerce, assuming that it continues to grow at the kind of the rate that we think it is, in that midteens kind of a range. So from a modeling perspective, if you're looking at a multiyear model or thinking about how we're going to do, 20 basis points a year improvement is probably the best, I think, that we'll be able to accomplish, absent improvement in comps from where we're running today.

It's also uniquely different for us in terms of the competitive set where the share sits. So unlike, let's say, women's apparel, in children's wear, we compete much more aggressively against retailers like Walmart and like Target. So I mean, I think our judgment is that it always comes back to product. Our prices are great in children's wear, in particular, they're great in Jumping Beans. And you're right, Jumping Beans as a brand has been far short of our expectation. But everything always comes back to product, and I think Michelle would tell you that, that's where we need to put our effort, is to give customers better choices and product, to time them from a speed perspective more effectively so they flow more evenly into the store. And more localized so they're more appropriate based on where the store is. I think those are the 3 big things."

The other one's been a more consistent performer for us, which is bath and beauty. That did well, and I would expect that to continue. Our categories that are dragging on sales in Accessories are categories like handbags, where we haven't had success. And very similarly to children's wear and the conversation we just had, often these things come back to product. And we just have to make better buying decisions and we have to give customers better choices. So it goes without saying, of course, that, that's a high priority for us right now."

If you just did the calculation for the third quarter, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store as a percent of our total digital demand was not as high as we had hoped for. We there's -- we're not trying to dodge that, that's a fact. But we've been focused all year on the fourth quarter because we know that's actually when the big opportunity presents itself. And the way we're looking at it first is really to have provided sort of best-in-class experience. And that starts with the enablers on customers' devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There's all kinds of operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that will actually drive the percentage to where we need it to be. I don't think we need to get, at this point, at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider, to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. I think if we make the experience phenomenal, I think it's going to be really, really good. And we seem to be overlooking, in some of the questions, the positive impact I think also of Ship from Store. Because again, we've put a stake in the ground to say our store portfolio is really important and we believe in it and we're going to amplify it. And the way we're going to amplify it is use our stores for all aspects of customer experience, which include not just Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, but also our ability to ship from store. And so I think both of those for the fourth quarter are going to be phenomenal. I think we'll be talking in February about really good indices on both of those strategies."

It's not increasing, it's just, as the percentage of the business goes forward, our costs per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers. It's especially important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75. So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned Ship from Store, that's helped from a speeding capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store; that's critical. So if we can continue to make progress there, I think you'll see the profitability improve. Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-com, they were flat, so that continues to -- obviously, their sales are much better than brick-and-mortar. So we continue to get a turn improvement from that perspective. So I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-com side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down. The EFC 5 that we're opening next year is going to be 3x as productive as our existing EFC. So we've got a lot of things in the hopper that are going to help us improve that profitability.
