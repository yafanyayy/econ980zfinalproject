With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 22% and 16%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter, with volume up 8% versus 2014. 
On the cost side, we continue to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. You will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts, we achieved the quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value-added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric."

In the fourth quarter our volume's down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, i t was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and the strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter, driven primarily by soft export soybean meal and DDG demand. Ethanol shipments were down 3%, driven by lower exports. These declines more than offset a 14% increase in canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. 
Food and refrigerated's products volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in beer was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments. 
Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. 
Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 
2015 annual sales in the U.S. was 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. 
On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove an 8% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was continued strength in the LPG markets including propylene, propane and butane demand. Finally, petroleum products volume was down 6%, primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of the slowing in China's production and export sectors. 
Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampen coal demand. Temperatures in the fall was 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal and 43 days above last December. Colorado/Utah tonnage was down 40% driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide, electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of '14 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured the share loss from Coal. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 23% on a 16% decline in volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand carloadings. 
Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity and the strong U.S. dollar. 
Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter , driven by increased waste shipments. And our motor revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter on a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. 
Full year 2015, Domestic Intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions offset by discontinuation of Triple Crown business in sourcing and shapes. International Intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment primarily due to  market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the transpacific street remains sluggish due to weaker-than-expected domestic U.S. retail sales. 
Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016.
In Ag Products, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and refrigerated should continue to see growth in Import Beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year but will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015. 
Turning to autos. We expect low interest rates in gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand, driving both finished vehicles and parts shipments. However, we are cautious as to auto sales sustaining these record levels. We expect the Coal market will continue to dampen babe low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always, weather conditions will continue to influence demand. 
In Chemicals, we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016 with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds. 
In Industrial Products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with a demand from the slow strengthening housing market would demand for construction products and specialized markets should be solid. 
In Intermodal, we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive Domestic Intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international intermodal volumes. 
Wrapping up, while strong U.S. dollar move inventory prices and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we're optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity, driven by energy reform and Mexico's manufacturing market. With our growth is dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron."

Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risks in a workplace is clearly having a positive impact as we achieved annual records in a way to an incident-free environment. 
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy and at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvement in the future. 
Moving on to network performance. After making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter, we've continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at the best-ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter. In fact, the last quarter we ran at this velocity was 6 years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer carloads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the eastern portion of our network during late December, thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. While we've made significant improvement in our metrics, we know there is still more work to do as the team continues their relentless push to further improve service and reduce costs. 
While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely aligned with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting the lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer re-crews, lessening resource demands of our network. By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates. 
In addition to efficiently right sizing our resource base, we also realized gains in other productivity initiatives such as train length. While we are unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We're also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. 
In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increase the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016. 
In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016, we are carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that will drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for customers with excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,320187073,919782,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year.

Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, and even's more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. 
Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. 
Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. 
Net income decreased 22% versus 2014, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. 
These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of [indiscernible] which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined 9%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was an $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind, we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international Intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. And with the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy repricing opportunities. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training-related activities as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time, given current volume levels, we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016. On average for the year, we would expect overall force [ph]  levels to be down somewhat, depending, of course, on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $424 million, down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and material expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. 
Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016, depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable onetime item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10%, excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning to our operating ratio performance. The fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2%, a 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, I am pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1, which is 0.4-point improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, right sizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins. 
Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow. In 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion, down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This is down just under $1 billion from 2014, primarily driven by lower earnings along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the 2 dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015, resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. As expected, the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015's cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. 
Taking a closer look at 2016, we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year end. When factoring in the 2 years worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year's cash flow. 
Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned, we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year's capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on invested capital was 14.3% in 2015, down 1.9 points from 2014 driven primarily by lower earnings. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. While cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year, we increased our balance sheet debt by 24% resulting in an all-in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year-end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which increased from 1.4 at year-end 2014. Longer-term, we are continuing to target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2x. While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is a valuable asset particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. 
In 2015, share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion, up 7% from 2014. Over the past 5 years, we've repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014, continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. 
So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy-related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter, we expect this year's first quarter coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with coal, it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid-single digits. For the full year, we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative, depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. 
Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings, at least in the first quarter, given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early, we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures, particularly in the first quarter, and likely throughout much of 2016. We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer-term operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And as always, no matter what the environment, we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

A bit reason as you know, for kind of the shrinkage and truck pricing is fuel is coming down, which is a major cause. So our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down. So they are seeing that natural cost-reduction benefit. So the gap, if you will, between the value proposition for Intermodal rail service versus truck, I think, that gap is still there in terms of Intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers. We've talked in the past about just by laws of physics, still on still rail is so lower cost than Robert Baird asphalt and concrete, so there is still a value proposition there that we think give us a leverage to continue to drive Highway conversions, which we demonstrated in '15 and we're going to continue to focus on in '16."

So we  by nature when we are planning crews, look out 6, 12, 18 months. And when we're talking about capital planning or locomotive acquisition, those lead times get longer. So it all begins with our business planning process and making sure that we have tight connectivity between what Eric and the commercial team are seeing and then how we are boiling that into a transportation plan and resources necessary to run it. Every time we see a significant shift in volume, whether it's significant growth or a significant shrink, we try to learn from that situation. As we are going into 2016, we think our business planning process is tighter. We think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand, more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so -- and I shouldn't miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the time lines that's saying terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment. We are also better, candidly, at -- when we have to store equipments, storing it quickly and efficiently.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 22% and 16%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter, with the volume up 8% versus 2014. 
On the cost side, we continue to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. You will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser-focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value-added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric."

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups.

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and the strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter, driven primarily by softer export soybean meal and DDG demand. Ethanol shipments were down 3%, driven by lower exports. These declines have more than offset a 14% increase in canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and Refrigerated's products volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in beer was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments. 
Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 2015 annual sales in the U.S. was 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove an 8% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was a continued strength in the LPG markets, including propylene, propane and butane demand. Finally, petroleum products volume was down 6%, primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of the slowing in China's production and export sectors. 
Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall were 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal and 43 days above last December. Colorado/Utah tonnage was down 40%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide, electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of '14 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured the share loss from Coal. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 23% on a 16% decline in volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand carloadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity and the strong U.S. dollar. Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter, driven by increased waste shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter on a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. Full year 2015, domestic Intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple Crown business in sourcing shapes. International Intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment, primarily due to market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans-Pacific Trade street remains sluggish due to weaker-than-expected domestic U.S. retail sales. 
Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag Products, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and Refrigerated should continue to see growth in Import Beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year, but will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015. 
Turning to Autos. We expect low interest rates in gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand, driving both finished vehicles and parts shipments. However, we are cautious as to auto sales sustaining these record levels. 
We expect the Coal market will continue to dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always, weather conditions will continue to influence demand. 
In Chemicals, we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016, with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds. 
In Industrial Products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with a demand from the slowly strengthening housing market, and demand for construction products and specialized markets should be solid. 
In Intermodal, we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international Intermodal volumes. 
Wrapping up, while the strong U.S. dollar and low energy prices and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we're optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity, driven by energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market. With our growth dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron."

Starting with our safety performance. Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in a workplace is clearly having a positive impact as we achieved annual records in a way to an incident-free environment. 
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy and at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvement in the future. 
Moving on to network performance. After making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter, we've continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at the best-ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter. In fact, the last quarter we ran at this velocity was 6 years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer carloads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the eastern portion of our network during late December, thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. But while we've made significant improvement in our metrics, we know there is still more work to do as the team continues their relentless push to further improve service and reduce cost.
While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely aligned with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer re-crews, lessening resource demands of our network. By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates. 
In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. 
In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increase the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016. 
In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016, we're carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that will drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand, while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for customers with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,320187073,919922,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year.

Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, an even more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. 
Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. 
Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by a lower pretax earnings. 
Net income decreased 22% versus 2014, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. 
These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of [indiscernible], which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined to 9%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was an $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind, we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international Intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. And with the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy repricing opportunities. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training-related activities as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time, given current volume levels, we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016. On average for the year, we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat, depending, of course, on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $424 million, down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016, depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable onetime item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10%, excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning to our operating ratio performance. The fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2%, a 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, I'm pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1, which is 0.4-point improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, rightsizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins. 
Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion, while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow. In 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion, down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This is down just under $1 billion from 2014, primarily driven by lower earnings, along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the 2 dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015, resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. As expected, the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015's cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. 
Taking a closer look at 2016, we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year-end. When factoring in the 2 years worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year's cash flow. 
Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned, we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year's capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on the invested capital was 14.3% in 2015, down 1.9 points from 2014, driven primarily by lower earnings. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. While cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year, we increased our balance sheet debt by 24%, resulting in an all-in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year-end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which increased from 1.4 at year-end 2014. Longer-term, we are continuing to target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2x. 
While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is a valuable asset, particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015, share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion, up 7% from 2014. Over the past 5 years, we have repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014, continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. 
So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy-related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter, we expect this year's first quarter Coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with Coal, it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid-single digits. For the full year, we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative, depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. 
Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings, at least in the first quarter, given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early, we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures, particularly in the first quarter, and likely throughout much of 2016. We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer-term operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And as always, no matter what the environment, we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

So a big reason, as you know, for kind of the shrinkage in truck pricing is fuel is coming down, which is the major cause. So our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down. So they're seeing that natural cost reduction benefit. So the gap, if you will, between the value proposition for intermodal rail service versus truck, I think, that gap is still there in terms of intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers. We've talked in the past about, just by laws of physics, steel wheel on steel rail is a lower cost than rubber tire on asphalt or concrete. So there still is a value proposition there that we think gives us a leverage to continue to drive highway conversions, which we demonstrated in '15 and we're going to continue to focus on in '16."

So we have to, by nature, when we're planning crews, look out 6, 12, 18 months. And when we're talking about capital planning or locomotive acquisition, those lead times get longer. So it all begins with our business planning process and making sure that we have tight connectivity between what Eric and the commercial team are seeing and then how we're boiling that into a transportation plan and the resources necessary to run it. Every time we see a significant shift in volume, whether it's significant growth or a significant shrink, we try to learn from that situation. As we're going into 2016, we think our business planning process is tighter. We think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand, more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so I -- and I shouldn't miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the time lines, let's say, in terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment. We're also better, candidly, at -- when we have to store equipments, storing it quickly and efficiently.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 22% and 16%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter, with the volume up 8% versus 2014. 
On the cost side, we continue to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. You will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser-focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value-added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric."

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups.

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and a strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter, driven primarily by softer export soybean meal and DDG demand. Ethanol shipments were down 3%, driven by lower exports. These declines have more than offset a 14% increase in canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and Refrigerated's products volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in beer was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments. 
Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 2015 annual sales in the U.S. were 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove an 8% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was a continued strength in the LPG markets, including propylene, propane and butane demand. Finally, petroleum products volume was down 6%, primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of the slowing in China's production and export sectors. 
Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall were 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal and 43 days above last December. Colorado/Utah tonnage was down 40%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide, electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of '14 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured the share loss from Coal. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 23% on a 16% decline in volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand carloadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity and the strong U.S. dollar. Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter, driven by increased waste shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter on a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. Full year 2015, domestic Intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple Crown business in sourcing shifts. International Intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment, primarily due to market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans-Pacific Trade remain sluggish due to weaker-than-expected domestic U.S. retail sales. 
Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag Products, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and Refrigerated should continue to see growth in Import Beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year, but will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015. 
Turning to Autos. We expect low interest rates in gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand, driving both finished vehicles and parts shipments. However, we are cautious as to auto sales sustaining these record levels. 
We expect the Coal market will continue to be dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always, weather conditions will continue to influence demand. 
In Chemicals, we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016, with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds. 
In Industrial Products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with demand from the slowly strengthening housing market, and demand for construction products and specialized markets should be solid. 
In Intermodal, we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international Intermodal volumes. 
Wrapping up, while the strong U.S. dollar and low energy prices and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we're optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity, driven by energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market. With our growth dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron."

Starting with our safety performance. Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in a workplace is clearly having a positive impact as we achieved annual records on our way to an incident-free environment. 
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvement in the future. 
Moving on to network performance. After making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter, we've continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at a best-ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter. In fact, the last quarter we ran at this velocity was 6 years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer carloads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the eastern portion of our network during late December, thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. But while we've made significant improvement in our metrics, we know there is still more work to do as the team continues their relentless push to further improve service and reduce cost.
While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely aligned with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer re-crews, lessening resource demands of our network. By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates. 
In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. 
In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increase the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016. 
In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016, we're carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that will drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand, while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for customers with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,320187073,919989,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year.

Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, an even more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. 
Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. 
Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by a lower pretax earnings. 
Net income decreased 22% versus 2014, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. 
These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of [indiscernible], which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined to 9%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was an $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind, we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international Intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. And with the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy repricing opportunities. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training-related activities as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time, given current volume levels, we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016. On average for the year, we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat, depending, of course, on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $424 million, down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016, depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable onetime item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10%, excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning to our operating ratio performance. The fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2%, a 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, I'm pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1, which is 0.4-point improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, rightsizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins. 
Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion, while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow. In 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion, down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This is down just under $1 billion from 2014, primarily driven by lower earnings, along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the 2 dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015, resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. As expected, the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015's cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. 
Taking a closer look at 2016, we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year-end. When factoring in the 2 years’ worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year's cash flow. 
Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned, we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year's capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on the invested capital was 14.3% in 2015, down 1.9 points from 2014, driven primarily by lower earnings. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. While cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year, we increased our balance sheet debt by 24%, resulting in an all-in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year-end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which increased from 1.4 at year-end 2014. Longer-term, we are continuing to target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2x. 
While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is a valuable asset, particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015, share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion, up 7% from 2014. Over the past 5 years, we have repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014, continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. 
So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy-related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter, we expect this year's first quarter Coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with Coal, it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid-single digits. For the full year, we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative, depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. 
Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings, at least in the first quarter, given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early, we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures, particularly in the first quarter, and likely throughout much of 2016. We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer-term operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And as always, no matter what the environment, we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

So our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down. So they're seeing that natural cost reduction benefit. So the gap, if you will, between the value proposition for intermodal rail service versus truck, I think, that gap is still there in terms of intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers. We've talked in the past about, just by laws of physics, steel wheel on steel rail is a lower cost than rubber tire on asphalt or concrete.

Every time we see a significant shift in volume, whether it's significant growth or a significant shrink, we try to learn from that situation. As we're going into 2016, we think our business planning process is tighter. We think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand, more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so -- and I shouldn't miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the time lines, let's say, in terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 22% and 16%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter, with the volume up 8% versus 2014. 
On the cost side, we continue to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. You will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser-focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value-added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric."

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups.

For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9% with continued gains in Automotive more than offset by declines in other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and a strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter, driven primarily by softer export soybean meal and DDG demand. Ethanol shipments were down 3%, driven by lower exports. These declines have more than offset a 14% increase in canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and Refrigerated's products volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in beer was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments. 
Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 2015 annual sales in the U.S. were 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove an 8% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was a continued strength in the LPG markets, including propylene, propane and butane demand. Finally, petroleum products volume was down 6%, primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of the slowing in China's production and export sectors. 
Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall were 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal and 43 days above last December. Colorado/Utah tonnage was down 40%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide, electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of '14 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured the share loss from Coal. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 23% on a 16% decline in volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand carloadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity and the strong U.S. dollar. Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter, driven by increased waste shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter on a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. Full year 2015, domestic Intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple Crown business in sourcing shifts. International Intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment, primarily due to market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans-Pacific Trade remain sluggish due to weaker-than-expected domestic U.S. retail sales. 
Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag Products, we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and Refrigerated should continue to see growth in Import Beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year, but will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015. 
Turning to Autos. We expect low interest rates in gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand, driving both finished vehicles and parts shipments. However, we are cautious as to auto sales sustaining these record levels. 
We expect the Coal market will continue to be dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always, weather conditions will continue to influence demand. 
In Chemicals, we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016, with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds. 
In Industrial Products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with demand from the slowly strengthening housing market, and demand for construction products and specialized markets should be solid. 
In Intermodal, we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international Intermodal volumes. 
Wrapping up, while the strong U.S. dollar and low energy prices and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we're optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity, driven by energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market. With our growth dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron."

Starting with our safety performance. Our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in a workplace is clearly having a positive impact as we achieved annual records on our way to an incident-free environment. 
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvement in the future. 
Moving on to network performance. After making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter, we've continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at a best-ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter. In fact, the last quarter we ran at this velocity was 6 years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer carloads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the eastern portion of our network during late December, thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. But while we've made significant improvement in our metrics, we know there is still more work to do as the team continues their relentless push to further improve service and reduce cost.
While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely aligned with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer re-crews, lessening resource demands of our network. By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates. 
In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. 
In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increase the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016. 
In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016, we're carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that will drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand, while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce cost. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for customers with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,320187073,920171,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year.

Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, an even more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. 
Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. 
Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by a lower pretax earnings. 
Net income decreased 22% versus 2014, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. 
These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of [indiscernible], which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined to 9%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was an $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind, we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international Intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. And with the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy repricing opportunities. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training-related activities as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time, given current volume levels, we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016. On average for the year, we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat, depending, of course, on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $424 million, down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016, depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable onetime item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10%, excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning to our operating ratio performance. The fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2%, a 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, I'm pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1, which is 0.4-point improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, rightsizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins. 
Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion, while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow. In 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion, down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This is down just under $1 billion from 2014, primarily driven by lower earnings, along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the 2 dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015, resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. As expected, the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015's cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. 
Taking a closer look at 2016, we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year-end. When factoring in the 2 years’ worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year's cash flow. 
Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned, we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year's capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on the invested capital was 14.3% in 2015, down 1.9 points from 2014, driven primarily by lower earnings. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. While cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year, we increased our balance sheet debt by 24%, resulting in an all-in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year-end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which increased from 1.4 at year-end 2014. Longer-term, we are continuing to target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2x. 
While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is a valuable asset, particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015, share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion, up 7% from 2014. Over the past 5 years, we have repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014, continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. 
So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy-related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter, we expect this year's first quarter Coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with Coal, it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid-single digits. For the full year, we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative, depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. 
Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings, at least in the first quarter, given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early, we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures, particularly in the first quarter, and likely throughout much of 2016. We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer-term operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And as always, no matter what the environment, we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As we're going into 2016, we think our business planning process is tighter. We think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand, more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so -- and I shouldn't miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the time lines, let's say, in terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment.

You've got some other tailwinds, you talked about bonus depreciation. It's pretty material numbers in terms of incremental cash flow potential. You slowed the pacing of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Just wondering, with that excess potential cash flow in 2016, is there an opportunity to step up share repurchases? What are the gating factors in terms of either debt ratios or what not, in terms of how aggressively you're willing to use what should be some surplus cash flow in 2016?"

I mean, our expectations coming off of certainly last year's low number from cash flow that we will hopefully positively generate increasing cash flow. And yes, we'll continue our philosophy of being opportunistic in the marketplace as it relates to shares. So I would expect that we will continue to do that. And as I called out, by the way, in the third quarter, that was a high watermark, if you will, that we've seen, at least in modern times, of a rate of which we were buying back shares, and that clearly was not our ratable rate in terms of shares. But we are opportunistic in terms of when we buy and how much we buy, and that attitude and that philosophy will continue in 2016. But if we can generate stronger levels of cash that gives us greater opportunities. And as we continue to walk up our debt-to-EBITDA, as we said and as we have, that gives us further opportunity."

This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 4 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 34% and 10%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter with carloads up 7% versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped to offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources and improving our customer experience. Our team will give you more of the details starting with Eric."

In the first quarter, our volume was down 8%, with a gain in Automotive and solid Chemicals volume more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we've generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. The Ag Products revenue was down 6% on a 4% volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7% as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4% as animal counts increased and there was less local grain available in our key estimation markets at the Midsouth and West. Exports declined 26% as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to amp the U.S. grain exports. Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. EBGs [ph] were down 29%, driven by decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean milk carloads were down 9% as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and Refrigerated Products carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength and demand for import beer. 
Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter as the 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicles shipments increased 5% driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for first quarter Automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year at levels of 16.7 million but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light [indiscernible] trucks and sport-utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increased and the continued focus on over the road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year, crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes excluding crude oil shipments were up 4% at the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8% due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments. 
Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38% and Colorado Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter as the warm winter, low natural gas prices and soft exports continue to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2 or less for much of the first quarter, TRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year-over-year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local brown sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling and increased imports. Demand for Construction Products, particularly rock and sand -- and cement improved 5% in the quarter driven by favorable weather conditions, which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter and further declines in sales pushed the number of months [indiscernible] to clear shelves of inventory to the highest levels since 2009. International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to transpacific market challenges. Slower global trade continued to pressure transpacific rates resulting in ocean carrier rationalization and market share losses by Union Pacific aligned carriers. Return of competitive premium service in the PNW also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal. 
To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag Products, strong worldwide crop reductions suggest little change to the current export environment, and we expect [indiscernible] wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply in U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth. 
Turning to autos light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million, driving both finished autos and parts including over the road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels. Due to declines in demand for coal, we expect volume will be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016 with growth in LPG markets and Industrial Chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year, weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year. 
At Industrial Products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market. 
Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from high reconvergence [ph] though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With transpacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. 
As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivate new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update."

Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risks in the workplace. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE-wide training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the number of incidents including those that did not meet the reportable threshold to a record low. 
In public safety, our grade [indiscernible] and incident rate increased to 2.37 as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvements in the future. In summary, for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment. 
In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews mostly from our alternative work status as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations. 
Moving on to resources. Driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status has declined status slightly from 3,900 at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015. 
In addition, we also continue to address other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well. While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area we continue to make progress is in train length. Now while we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with the 5% decline in the number of car switched [ph] . Overall, we continued to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. 
In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong holding. Moving forward, we expect further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost in safety where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. While near-term uncertainty remains in the current the volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce costs. This includes our capital investments where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year.

Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8% and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year, and keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015. As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel and export ag shipments partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by pension favorability. 
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still -- we're realigning our resources and we had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume, but as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation still expects to come in around 2% for the full year. This was driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 13% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, improved cycle times and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning now to our operating ratio performance. The first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5 point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, rightsizing our resources to current demand and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance. 
Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared  to the first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital, more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our cash balance at quarter-end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter-end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. 
In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. So that's a recap of the first quarter results. 
As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter, along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year. In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. Overall, volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we had experienced in the last couple of quarters. In addition as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year. We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. 
In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our growth to 55 plus 0 initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55 over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance in productivity in innovation, in customer experience and, of course, in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but, ultimately, our earnings, our cash flow and our returns in the years ahead. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

Generally speaking, long term, it is in a sweet spot in terms of growth competitiveness. We had headwinds this year with a strong dollar, but it's in the sweet spot and the U.S. has produced and will continue to be a good producer and we, as a transportation provider, will continue to have the benefit of moving that business."

In terms of our headcount going forward, I mean as I said and as we've always said, we're going to continue to squeeze out productivity. Headcount will move as volume does but not 1 for 1 because we are continually focused on identifying continuing productivity initiatives. And I think you saw that certainly in the first quarter with an 11% reduction in the headcount. That was good productivity initiatives, but we're not done. The whole theme of the G to 55 initiative is focused on continued productivity. So I would expect that trend will continue in terms of moving with volume but offset by productivity results."

I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time.

Another factor is, with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all of that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TE use on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal. So I think as you look at this transpacific rationalization, larger ships -- there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal.

As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which full year last year was a $300 million or $390 million kind of number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion. And in these days, we're spending more like $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels. Now having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first 3 things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume with, what the environment looks like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns. In my mind's eye, you're still going to see a spend down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity, and you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GTMs."

There's a lot of growing interest in terms of moving products there and we're working on a number of different initiatives with that. And so there is general economic strength that we're seeing in our industrial products business in terms of the construction coming back, housing coming back.

Some of those headwinds represent structural shift like in coal, where a portion of that book of business is probably permanently reduced.

This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 4 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 34% and 10%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter with carloads up 7% versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped to offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources and improving our customer experience. 
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the first quarter, our volume was down 8% with a gain in Automotive and solid Chemicals volume, more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 6% on a 4% volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7% as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4% as animal counts increased, and there was less local grain available in our key estimation markets at the Midsouth and West. Exports declined 26% as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports. Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9% as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and Refrigerated Products carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength and demand for import beer. 
Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter as the 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicles shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for first quarter Automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year, crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil shipments, were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments. 
Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado, Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter as warm -- as the warm winter, low natural gas prices and soft exports continued to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year-over-year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local brown sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling and increased imports. Demand for Construction Products, particularly rock and sand  and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions, which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest levels since 2009. International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continued to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. Return of competitive premium service in the PNW also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal. 
To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag Products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and the U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth. 
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels. Due to declines in demand for coal, we expect volume will be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016 with growth in the LPG markets and Industrial Chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year. 
At Industrial Products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market. 
Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. 
As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivate new business opportunities across our diverse franchise.  With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update."

Starting with our safety performance. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in",679,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risks in the workplace. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvements in the future. In summary, for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment. 
In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews mostly from alternative work status as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations. 
Moving on to resources. Driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we also continue to address other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well. 
While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area we continue to make progress is in train length. Now while we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with the 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. 
In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce cost. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,329049159,960879,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offs",1433,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8%, and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015. As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel and export ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by pension favorability. 
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume, but as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation still expects to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 13% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, improved cycle times and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning now to our operating ratio performance. The first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5 point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, rightsizing our resources to current demand and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance. 
Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital, more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our cash balance at quarter-end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter-end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. 
In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. So that's a recap of the first quarter results. 
As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year. In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. 
Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mixed pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we had experienced in the last couple of quarters.
In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year. We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our growth to 55 + 0 initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55 over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course, in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow and our returns in the years ahead. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength in the U.S. dollar and soft global economy and muted domestic retail demand have all committed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago.

Generally speaking, long term, it is in a sweet spot in terms of world's competitiveness. We had headwinds this year with the strong dollar, but it's in a sweet spot, and the U.S. has produced and will continue to be a good producer.

So I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by 2 weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all of that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal. So I think as you look at this transpacific rationalization, larger ships -- there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal.

As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which full year last year was a $300 million or $390 million kind of number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion. And in these days, we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels. Now having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first 3 things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns. In my mind's eye, you're still going to see a spend-down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity, and you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GTMs."

This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 4 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 34% and 10%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter with carloads up 7% versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped to offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources and improving our customer experience. 
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the first quarter, our volume was down 8% with a gain in Automotive and solid Chemicals volume, more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 6% on a 4% volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7% as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4% as animal counts increased, and there was less local grain available in our key destination markets in the Midsouth and West. Exports declined 26% as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports. Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by a decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9% as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and Refrigerated Products carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength and demand for import beer. 
Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter as the 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicles shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for first quarter Automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million, but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year, crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil shipments, were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments. 
Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado, Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter as warm -- as the warm winter, low natural gas prices and soft exports continued to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year-over-year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local brown sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling and increased imports. Demand for Construction Products, particularly rock and sand and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions, which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest levels since 2009. International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continued to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. Return of competitive premium service in the PNW also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal. 
To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag Products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and the U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth. 
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels. Due to declines in demand for coal, we expect volume will be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016 with growth in LPG markets and Industrial Chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year. 
In Industrial Products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market. 
Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. 
As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivate new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update."

Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risk in the workplace. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvements in the future. In summary, for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment. 
In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews mostly from alternative work status as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations. 
Moving on to resources. Driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we also continue to address other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well. 
While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area we continue to make progress is in train length. Now while we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with the 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. 
In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect to further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce cost. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offs",1434,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8%, and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015. As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel and export ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by pension favorability. 
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume, but as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation still expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 13% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, the improved cycle times and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning now to our operating ratio performance. The first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5 point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, rightsizing our resources to current demand and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance. 
Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital, more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our cash balance at quarter-end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter-end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. 
In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. So that's a recap of the first quarter results. 
As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year. In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. 
Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we had experienced in the last couple of quarters.
In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year. We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our Grow to 55 + 0 initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55 over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course, in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow and our returns in the years ahead. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength in the U.S. dollar and soft global economy and muted domestic retail demand have all contributed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago. We've improved the fluidity of our network with service metrics at all-time bests. We also achieved a record industry best employee safety rate as we work toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries. 
It's challenging to do business in such an uncertain market, but we will continue to be agile in adapting to new business environments, making our company more productive, more innovative, and ultimately, more successful for the long term. We will continue to leverage the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise to drive new business opportunities, to provide an excellent customer experience and to generate strong long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, let's open up the line for your questions."

Generally speaking, long term, it is in a sweet spot in terms of world competitiveness.

But as you see plans and new teaming up amongst the container liners that's going on, is there any thought of any shift of capacity given the impact of the port strike a year ago and thoughts on how that distributes the Intermodal volumes?"

So I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by 2 weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all of that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal. So I think as you look at this transpacific rationalization, larger ships -- there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal. I think the West Coast port still will remain a very strong -- a viable competitor. And fundamentally, we're not changing our perspective and our outlook that we've had over the last couple of years."

As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which full year last year was a $300 million or $390 million kind of number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion. And in these days, we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels. Now having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first 3 things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns. In my mind's eye, you're still going to see us spend-down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity, and you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GTMs."

There's a lot of growing interest in terms of moving products there, and we are working on a number of different initiatives with that. And so there is general economic strength that we're seeing in our industrial products business in terms of the construction coming back, housing coming back. Chemicals has the benefit of plastics going to the automotive industry as you see automotive sales. And so there's a slowly strengthening economy out there.

This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 4 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products down 34% and 10%, respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter with carloads up 7% versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped to offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources and improving our customer experience. 
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the first quarter, our volume was down 8% with a gain in Automotive and solid Chemicals volume, more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 6% on a 4% volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7% as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4% as animal counts increased, and there was less local grain available in our key destination markets in the Midsouth and West. Exports declined 26% as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports. Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by a decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9% as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and Refrigerated Products carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength and demand for import beer. 
Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter as the 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicles shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for first quarter Automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million, but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume. 
Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year, crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil shipments, were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments. 
Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado, Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter as warm -- as the warm winter, low natural gas prices and soft exports continued to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year-over-year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local brown sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling and increased imports. Demand for Construction Products, particularly rock and sand and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions, which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest levels since 2009. International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continued to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. Return of competitive premium service in the PNW also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal. 
To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag Products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and the U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth. 
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels. Due to declines in demand for coal, we expect volume will be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016 with growth in LPG markets and Industrial Chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year. 
In Industrial Products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market. 
Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. 
As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivate new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update."

Starting with our safety performance. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in",680,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risk in the workplace. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvements in the future. In summary, for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment. 
In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7%, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews mostly from alternative work status as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations. 
Moving on to resources. Driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we also continue to address other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well. 
While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area we continue to make progress is in train length. Now while we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with the 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. 
In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect to further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way towards 0 incidents. While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce cost. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,329049159,961560,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offs",1434,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion. 
Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8%, and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015. As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel and export ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by pension favorability. 
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume, but as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation still expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 13% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, the improved cycle times and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning now to our operating ratio performance. The first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5 point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, rightsizing our resources to current demand and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance. 
Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital, more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our cash balance at quarter-end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter-end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. 
In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. So that's a recap of the first quarter results. 
As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year. In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. 
Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we had experienced in the last couple of quarters.
In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year. We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our Grow to 55 + 0 initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55 over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course, in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow and our returns in the years ahead. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength in the U.S. dollar and soft global economy and muted domestic retail demand have all contributed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago.

Generally speaking, long term, it is in a sweet spot in terms of world competitiveness. We had headwinds this year with the strong dollar, but it's in a sweet spot, and the U.S. has produced and will continue to be a good producer.

So I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by 2 weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all of that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal. So I think as you look at this transpacific rationalization, larger ships -- there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal. I think the West Coast port still will remain a very strong -- a viable competitor.

As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which full year last year was a $300 million or $390 million kind of number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion. And in these days, we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels. Now having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first 3 things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns. In my mind's eye, you're still going to see us spend-down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity, and you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GTMs."

So the way we think about coal is it's facing a large number of headwinds right now.

What it might look like 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, we still think it's a pretty important part of the overall electricity generating base in the United States. It's not going back -- we don't think -- to where it was 4 or 5 years ago. And you can make an argument either way that it strengthens a bit or that it might decline a bit.

On the fuel, the guidance we're giving on fuel is that while it was a $0.10 headwind in the first quarter, largely driven by the $0.08 benefit the previous first quarter last year, we think that's going to moderate. If fuel prices stay kind of where they are, our expectation would be that, that headwind will moderate largely because we start to sort of lap the falloff in fuel from the previous year."

This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal, Intermodal and Industrial Products all down double digits. Agricultural Products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year as positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes. While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service and improving our safety performance. 
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in A",1085,"Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June. While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue. 
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger-than-expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico. Weak shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher-quality Canadian wheat. Grain products shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels. Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food and refrigerated carloads grew 2% as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets resulting from abundant truck supply. 
Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by 2% decrease in volume and an 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue were negatively impacted by a mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car than finished vehicles. 
Finished vehicles shipments decreased 10%, driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific plants and contract changes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter Automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles. However, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new open road conversions. 
Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remains strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic ag markets. Strength in other areas, including growth in Industrial Chemicals partially offset these declines. 
We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter, due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, Chemicals volumes was up 1% in the quarter. 
Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar. 
PRB Coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down 6 days from May but still 35 days above the 5-year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which is 47% higher than what was burned in May. Industrial Products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volumes was down 32% in the quarter here. Frac san shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from lower oil prices and market ships to short-haul brown sand alternatives. Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in sales drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar. Construction Products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity. 
Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year. Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow transpacific trade and a volume loss by UPM line container ship carriers. 
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we saw toward the end of the second quarter. In Ag Products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments. Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in Import Beer is expected throughout 2016. 
Moving to Autos. Recent economic forecast suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. We expect low gasoline prices will help sustained demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production in sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural guess prices, high inventory levels, export demand and weather. We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and Industrial Chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market. In Industrial Products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing markets should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes. Finally, in Intermodal, we expect international volumes will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation. On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are number of uncertainties in worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provide opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of sever injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continue to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of 0 incidents. 
With respect to rail equipment incidence or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, and hence, DOI training and continued infrastructure investment help significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable thresholds to a new record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this is a step back from last year's solid performance, we are confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings or incidents are more likely to occur. Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive improvement in the future. 
Moving to network performance. After experiencing a relatively mild winter conditions to start off the year, flooding events in the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate of variability in the network, but it's something we're accustomed to dealing with. Utilizing the diverse strength of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible, temporary utilize a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recall TE&Y cruise as our employees work diligently to restore operations. These efforts kept the impact to a minimum, including the delays of disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall, velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource division was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Drop the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource level to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. 
In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This concludes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees or 7% versus of the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter 2015. 
While adjusting our resources to demand will always be key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within this scheduled intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. The fluidity and productivity of our network is also reflected in the second quarter low recruitment rate. A failure cause incurred when the first group has insufficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed. 
In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results, while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strength of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience. And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce cost. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significant lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the",1467,"Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significant lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel cost, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact on whether on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June. The total operating expense impact from these 2 events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions. 
Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year. 
Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 19% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combine to produce a quarterly earning of $1.17 per share. 
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11%, and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices with a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers, and coming into the second quarter, these fuel prices where below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have hedged up. Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the 2-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected. The primary drivers of mix this quarter was significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%. 
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which was partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%. 
Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter. Our employee headcount declined 12% or almost 6,000 as a result of lower volumes and our G55 plus 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total workforce levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016. And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2%, while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon. 
Moving on to other expense categories. Purchase services and material expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets. 
Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to be increased slightly compared to last year. 
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. The equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items. 
Turning to our operating ratio. The second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.2 points in the quarter. 
Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter-end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. For the 6 -- first 6 months of the year, we have bought back about 16.3 million shares totaling over $1.3 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. So that's a recap of the second quarter results. 
Looking out to the rest of the year. We expect volume will continue to be a challenge even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so, and Coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year. We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with volume reduction in this range, we will, of course, continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. 
On the capital front, we are still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements, and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we're still working through the details. We're diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well underway and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months. We are confident our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lance."

As you heard from everyone here this morning, we continue to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups. A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year. 
That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related businesses. We're also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions. Beyond the impact of the current macroenvironment, we're implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises 6 primary value tracks, and you've heard to these themes woven throughout our comments today. These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety, while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity both designed to improve our work processes, so we can make the most of out of what we have. Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach and our proprietary technology. And of course, our G55 and 0 initiatives cut across all 6 of these tracks. In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve and solid returns for our shareholders. 
With that, it's open up the line for your questions."

And with the revised volume guidance for the full year, what we're saying there, we're signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game. But having said that, that does imply over guidance on volume does imply our guidance on commitment to improving our margins, does imply that we expect to make continued improvement from here on our operating ratio and not only this year but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019, 60 plus or minus. On the headcount question, yes, we had very good performance as it relates headcount in the second quarter. Volumes obviously play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending volumes are actually are combined with the refocused on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume. And our expectation from this going forward backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially, we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today. That would suggest that headcount will move up but not 1 for 1. And by the time we finished the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend on exactly how the volumes play out."

And so if you look at the pretty decent yields from the current crop, if you look at the high storage levels on a historical basis, if you look at some of the challenges that, in particular, South American crops have had, it suggests that there's going to be opportunity to move grain the second half of the year at the higher run rate than what we saw in the first half."

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal, Intermodal and Industrial Products all down double digits. Agricultural Products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year as positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes. While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service and improving our safety performance.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in A",1090,"Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June. While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger-than-expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico. Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher-quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels. Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food and refrigerated carloads grew 2% as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets resulting from abundant truck supply.
Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and an 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue and ARC were negatively impacted by a mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car than finished vehicles.
Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10%, driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter Automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles. However, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over-the-road conversions.
Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic ag markets. Strength in other areas, including growth in Industrial Chemicals partially offset these declines.
We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter, due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, Chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah rail shipments were down, both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar.
PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down 6 days from May, but still 35 days above the 5-year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which is 47% higher than what was burned in May. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 32% in the quarter here. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. 
Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar. Construction Products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity.
Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year. Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow transpacific trade and a volume loss by UPM line container ship carriers. 
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we saw towards the end of the second quarter. In Ag Products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments. Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in Import Beer is expected throughout 2016. 
Moving to Autos. Recent economic forecast suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production in sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand and weather. We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and Industrial Chemicals volumes, will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market. In Industrial Products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing markets should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes. Finally, in Intermodal, we expect international volumes will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation. On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continue to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of 0 incidents.
With respect to rail equipment incidence or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment help significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we are confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings or incidents are more likely to occur. Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive an improvement in the future.
Moving to network performance. After experiencing a relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events on the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something we're accustomed to dealing with. Utilizing the diverse strength of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible, temporary utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y cruise as our employees work diligently to restore operations. These efforts kept the impact to a minimum, including the delays of disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall, velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource division was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource level to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.
In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees or 7% versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015.
While adjusting our resources to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. The fluidity and productivity of our network is also reflected in the second quarter low recrew rate. And failure costs incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed.
In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half for the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strength of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience. And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce cost. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,367957386,1009511,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in th",1473,"Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June. The total operating expense impact from these 2 events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions.
Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year.
Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 19% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combine to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share.
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices with a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers, and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up. Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the 2-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected. The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%.
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%.
Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter. Our employee count declined 12% or almost 6,000 as a result of lower volumes and our G55 plus 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total workforce levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016. And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well.
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2%, while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets.
Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. The equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio. The second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.2 points in the quarter.
Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. For the 6 -- first 6 months of the year, we have bought back about 16.3 million shares totaling over $1.3 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. So that's a recap of the second quarter results.
Looking out to the rest of the year. We expect volume will continue to be a challenge even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so and coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year. We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with a volume reduction in this range, we will, of course, continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019.
On the capital front, we are still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements, and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details. We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well underway and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months. We are confident, our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lance."

As you heard from everyone here this morning, we continue to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups. A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year.
That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions. Beyond the impact of the current macroenvironment, we're implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises 6 primary value tracks, and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today. These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most of out of what we have. Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach and our proprietary technology. And of course, our G55 and 0 initiatives cut across all 6 of these tracks. In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength the communities that we serve and solid returns for our shareholders.

But having said that, that does imply our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins, does imply that we expect to make continued improvements from here on our operating ratio and not only this year, but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019, 60 plus or minus. On the headcount question, yes, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes obviously play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume. And our expectation from this going forward, backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially, we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today. That would suggest that headcount will move up, but not one for one. And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out."

I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that, clearly, there are a lot more utilities that are in the money just if you look at that increased burn. So that would be my coal comment. In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol, from a used standpoint, is ""always in the money"" because it's needed as necessary oxygenate and then replacement from the MBTEs for gasoline. And so as gasoline volumes go, ethanol blending with that will go. The question is, how much margin the ethanol manufacturers are making?

There is no evidence that crew size is related to safety. The FRA stated that in the preamble to their own rule.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal, Intermodal and Industrial Products all down double digits. Agricultural Products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year as positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes. While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service and improving our safety performance.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups.

In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June. While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger-than-expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico. Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher-quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels. Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food and refrigerated carloads grew 2% as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets resulting from abundant truck supply.
Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and an 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue and ARC were negatively impacted by a mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car than finished vehicles.
Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10%, driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter Automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles. However, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over-the-road conversions.
Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic ag markets. Strength in other areas, including growth in Industrial Chemicals, partially offset these declines.
We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, Chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar.
PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down 6 days from May, but still 35 days above the 5-year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which is 47% higher than what was burned in May. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 32% in the quarter. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. 
Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar. Construction Products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity.
Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year. Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow transpacific trade and a volume loss by UPM line container ship carriers. 
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we saw towards the end of the second quarter. In Ag Products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments. Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in Import Beer is expected throughout 2016. 
Moving to Autos. Recent economic forecasts suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production and sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand and weather. We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and Industrial Chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market. In Industrial Products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing markets should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes. Finally, in Intermodal, we expect international volumes will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation. On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of 0 incidents.
With respect to rail equipment incidence or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents including those that do not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we are confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings where incidents are more likely to occur. Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive an improvement in the future.
Moving to network performance. After experiencing relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events on the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something we're accustomed to dealing with. Utilizing the diverse strength of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible, temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews as our employees worked diligently to restore operations. These efforts kept the impact to a minimum, including the delays or disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall, velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource level to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.
In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees or 7% versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015.
While adjusting our resources to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. The fluidity and productivity of our network is also reflected in the second quarter low recrew rate. A failure cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed.
In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half for the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strength of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience. And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce cost. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year.

Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June. The total operating expense impact from these 2 events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions.
Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year.
Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 19% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share.
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices with a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers, and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up. Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the 2-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected. The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%.
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%.
Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter. Our employee count declined 12% or almost 6,000 as a result of lower volumes and our G55 plus 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total workforce levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016. And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well.
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2%, while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets.
Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. The equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio. The second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.2 points in the quarter.
Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. For the 6 -- first 6 months of the year, we have bought back about 16.3 million shares totaling over $1.3 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. So that's a recap of the second quarter results.
Looking out to the rest of the year. We expect volume will continue to be a challenge even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so and coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year. We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with a volume reduction in this range, we will, of course, continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019.
On the capital front, we are still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements, and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details. We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well under way, and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months. We are confident our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lance."

As you heard from everyone here this morning, we continued to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups. A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year.
That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions. Beyond the impact of the current macro environment, we're implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises 6 primary value tracks, and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today. These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most of out of what we have. Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach and our proprietary technology. And of course, our G55 and 0 initiatives cut across all 6 of these tracks. In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve and solid returns for our shareholders.

Just wondering if the Safety of Life at Sea mandate had caused some volatility maybe on the volume side as we heard some shippers were moving volumes ahead of the July 1 mandate. So curious to see if you had seen of that, which would perhaps be weighing on volumes now and if you had to make any adjustments for the on-dock rail, to kind of satisfy that, the weight certification requirements when that rolled out earlier this month?"

One, yes, my commentary on the operating ratio was a full year comment because as you know, we had previously said our expectation earlier in the year was, call it mid-single digit volume decline for the full year. And with that assumption, improvement year-over-year on the operating ratio, and with revised volume guidance for the full year, what we're saying there, we're signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game. But having said that, that does imply -- our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins, does imply that we expect to make continued improvements from here on our operating ratio and not only this year, but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019, 60 plus or minus. On the headcount question, yes, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes obviously play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume. And our expectation from this point forward, backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially, we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today. That would suggest that headcount will move up, but not one for one. And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out."

I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that, clearly, there are a lot more utilities that are in the money just if you look at that increased burn. So that would be my coal comment. In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol, from a used standpoint, is ""always in the money"" because it's needed as a necessary oxygenate and then replacement from the MBTEs for gasoline. And so as gasoline volumes go, ethanol blending with that will go. The question is, how much margin the ethanol manufacturers are making.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal, Intermodal and Industrial Products all down double digits. Agricultural Products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year as positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes. While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service and improving our safety performance.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in A",1090,"Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11%, with gains in Ag Products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volumes sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June. While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger-than-expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico. Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher-quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels. Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food and refrigerated carloads grew 2% as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets resulting from abundant truck supply.
Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and an 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue and ARC were negatively impacted by a mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car than finished vehicles.
Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10%, driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter Automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles. However, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over-the-road conversions.
Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic ag markets. Strength in other areas, including growth in Industrial Chemicals, partially offset these declines.
We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, Chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar.
PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down 6 days from May, but still 35 days above the 5-year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which is 47% higher than what was burned in May. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 32% in the quarter. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. 
Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar. Construction Products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity.
Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year. Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow transpacific trade and a volume loss by UPM line container ship carriers. 
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we saw towards the end of the second quarter. In Ag Products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments. Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in Import Beer is expected throughout 2016. 
Moving to Autos. Recent economic forecasts suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production and sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand and weather. We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and Industrial Chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market. In Industrial Products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing markets should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes. Finally, in Intermodal, we expect international volumes will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation. On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of 0 incidents.
With respect to rail equipment incidence or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents including those that do not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. 
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we are confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings where incidents are more likely to occur. Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive an improvement in the future.
Moving to network performance. After experiencing relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events on the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something we're accustomed to dealing with. Utilizing the diverse strength of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible, temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews as our employees worked diligently to restore operations. These efforts kept the impact to a minimum, including the delays or disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall, velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource level to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.
In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees or 7% versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015.
While adjusting our resources to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. And while we are unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. The fluidity and productivity of our network is also reflected in the second quarter low recrew rate. A failure cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed.
In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half for the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strength of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience. And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce cost. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June. The total operating expense impact from these 2 events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions.
Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year.
Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 19% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share.
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices with a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers, and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up. Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the 2-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected. The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%.
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%.
Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter. Our employee count declined 12% or almost 6,000 as a result of lower volumes and our G55 plus 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total workforce levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016. And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well.
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2%, while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchase services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets.
Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. The equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio. The second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.2 points in the quarter.
Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year-end as we continue to target a ratio of less than 2x. For the 6 -- first 6 months of the year, we have bought back about 16.3 million shares totaling over $1.3 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year. So that's a recap of the second quarter results.
Looking out to the rest of the year. We expect volume will continue to be a challenge even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so and coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year. We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with a volume reduction in this range, we will, of course, continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019.
On the capital front, we are still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements, and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details. We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well under way, and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months. We are confident our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lance."

As you heard from everyone here this morning, we continued to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups. A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year.
That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions. Beyond the impact of the current macro environment, we're implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises 6 primary value tracks, and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today. These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most of out of what we have. Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach and our proprietary technology. And of course, our G55 and 0 initiatives cut across all 6 of these tracks. In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve and solid returns for our shareholders.
With that, let's open up the line for your questions."

And with that assumption, improvement year-over-year on the operating ratio, and with revised volume guidance for the full year, what we're saying there, we're signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game. But having said that, that does imply -- our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins, does imply that we expect to make continued improvements from here on our operating ratio and not only this year, but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019, 60 plus or minus. On the headcount question, yes, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes obviously play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume. And our expectation from this point forward, backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially, we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today. That would suggest that headcount will move up, but not one for one. And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out."

I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that, clearly, there are a lot more utilities that are in the money just if you look at that increased burn. So that would be my coal comment. In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol, from a used standpoint, is ""always in the money"" because it's needed as a necessary oxygenate and then replacement from the MBTEs for gasoline.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products both down double digits. Agricultural Product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015, as grain shipments finally started to show some strength.
The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which is up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives as well as positive core pricing helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our 6 value tracks.

In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record Agricultural Products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups.

In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record Agricultural Products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets in a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy-related and international Intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid reinvestable returns even in these difficult markets and remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume and the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and lifted grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter, as adverse weather in South America caused significant losses, elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grain products carloads advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments. Food and refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter, as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. 
Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles, impacting key Union Pacific-served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of 17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. On the parts side, a continued focus on [ph] over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume.
Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48% due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments, was up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however, overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16%, respectively, in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer-than-average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days, down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings, impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction Products volume was down 8% due to weather-impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic Intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown Service, domestic was nearly flat. International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continue to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory and the Hanjin bankruptcy.
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag Products, we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong, driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at 17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of 17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals, offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.
In Industrial Products, lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. We anticipate a softer year-end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. 
Finally, in Intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained [ph] ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In [ph] the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal [ph] injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low 0.77.  Included in this was a record-low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0 incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable threshold to a record low.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. 
Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a fluid network were somewhat offset by productivity gains, such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. 
Moving on to resources. As part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with the goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads.
As you know, we've been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year, with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We're adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.
Turning to network productivity. While we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks were in at [ph] all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter record.
Recrew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip, is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter recrew rate was 2.3%, a near-2-point improvement from 2015 and the third quarter record.
As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident-free environment. And where growth opportunities arise, we'll leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,402444700,1057462,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in",1378,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. 
Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, an 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. Interest expense of $184 million was up 17% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.
Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. 
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but up $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter.
Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail in our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect the competitive marketplace in a soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return-driven core pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year.
As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 6% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record [ph] $1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, which reduced car hire expense, and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year.
As we discussed back in September, we have written off the $13 million accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. In addition, we also incurred $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects, which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense, also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.
Turning to our operating ratio. The third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter.
Looking at cash flow. Cash from operations for the first 3 quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. For the full year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September.
Taking a look now at the balance sheet. Our all-in debt -- adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter-end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of over 1.9x, up from 1.7x at year-end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than 2x. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares, totaling about $2.2 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first 3 quarters of this year.
So that's a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits, and we still expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 + 0 initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible.
And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. 
From a productivity perspective, our G55 + 0 initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year. And we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvement well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 + 0 initiatives.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As the team has articulated here this morning, we continued to experience a difficult but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines, such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges: an unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods.
However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. The recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million BTU, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With a record harvest currently underway, we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our ag customers.
Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we'll continue to do what Union Pacific does best: operate a safe, efficient and productive network, while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.

One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match-backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain, in particular, DDGs to China. We are continuing to look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. We're also really excited longer term or midterm in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf. And we think that that's going to be an excellent opportunity for match-backs also. So we think both of those things are great opportunities.

So one of the things that we are really excited about is the great franchise we have, and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise, obviously, as we mentioned, the energy-related and the international-related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So we've been talking about the challenges in coal. Coal, as you know, has been greatly challenged not by demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great -- a strong competitor to coal. The low -- below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We're excited -- or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that, that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal. But that has clearly had an impact. Likewise, the 3 major bankrupts -- or the 3 major mergers, the 1 large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at reinvestable returns.

It is not a same-store sales kind of number. It is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions and the denominators are our entire book of business. So it includes contracts that perhaps we didn't touch certainly in the quarter for pricing. So having said that, there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag, if you will, in terms of the yield dollars that come from our pricing actions.

To your point, strong dollar does make exports difficult, however, even in today's world you see, for instance, grain exporting off Pacific Northwest and the Gulf coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar, so market conditions can still prompt commodity movement and global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that, where a couple of years ago, people would say $70 a barrel of shale oil was competitive and in today's world, no, they say that would be more like $50 a barrel. So there's a lot of moving parts there. Clearly, we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy, which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports.

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products both down double digits. Agricultural Product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015, as grain shipments finally started to show some strength.
The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which is up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives as well as positive core pricing helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our 6 value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record Agricultural Products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets in a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy-related and international Intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid reinvestable returns even in these difficult markets and remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume and the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and lifted grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter, as adverse weather in South America caused significant losses, elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grain products carloads advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments. Food and refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter, as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. 
Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles, impacting key Union Pacific-served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of 17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. On the parts side, the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume.
Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48% due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments, was up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however, overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16%, respectively, in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer-than-average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days, down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings, impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction Products volume was down 8% due to weather-impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic Intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown Service, domestic was nearly flat. International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continue to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory and the Hanjin bankruptcy.
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag Products, we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong, driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at 17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of 17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals, offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.
In Industrial Products, lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. We anticipate a softer year-end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. 
Finally, in Intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low 0.77.  Included in this was a record-low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0 incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable threshold to a record low.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. 
Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a fluid network were somewhat offset by productivity gains, such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. 
Moving on to resources. As part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with the goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads.
As you know, we've been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year, with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We're adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.
Turning to network productivity. While we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks were in at all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter record.
Recrew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip, is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter recrew rate was 2.3%, a near-2-point improvement from 2015 and the third quarter record.
As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident-free environment. And where growth opportunities arise, we'll leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,402444700,1057791,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in",1377,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. 
Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, an 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. Interest expense of $184 million was up 17% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.
Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. 
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but up $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter.
Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail in our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect the competitive marketplace in a soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return-driven core pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year.
As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 6% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record $1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, which reduced car hire expense, and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year.
As we discussed back in September, we have written off the $13 million accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. In addition, we also incurred $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects, which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense, also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.
Turning to our operating ratio. The third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter.
Looking at cash flow. Cash from operations for the first 3 quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. For the full year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September.
Taking a look now at the balance sheet. Our all-in debt -- adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter-end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of over 1.9x, up from 1.7x at year-end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than 2x. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares, totaling about $2.2 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first 3 quarters of this year.
So that's a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits, and we still expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 + 0 initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible.
And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. 
From a productivity perspective, our G55 + 0 initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year. And we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvement well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 + 0 initiatives.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As the team has articulated here this morning, we continued to experience a difficult but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines, such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges: an unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods.
However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. The recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million BTU, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With a record harvest currently underway, we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our ag customers.
Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we'll continue to do what Union Pacific does best: operate a safe, efficient and productive network, while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.

As you mentioned, Cherilyn, there's a significant volatility going on in the international container ship business. There have been 3 major mergers, 1 bankruptcy. There are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match-backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain, in particular, DDGs to China. We are continuing to look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. We're also really excited longer term or midterm in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf. And we think that that's going to be an excellent opportunity for match-backs also. So we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China, occasionally, as they have right now, has tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs; but we think, long term, that should be opportunity for us."

So we've been talking about the challenges in coal. Coal, as you know, has been greatly challenged not by demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great -- a strong competitor to coal. The low -- below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We're excited -- or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that, that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal. But that has clearly had an impact. Likewise, the 3 major bankrupts -- or the 3 major mergers, the 1 large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at reinvestable returns.

Number one, as I think you and others know, we have about 25% of our business, if you will, that is affected by A-lift. So over a longer period of time, that mechanism sort of may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But over a longer period of time, it tends to reflect what's happening with the rail inflation, number one. But I guess, I would more broadly say and remind folks the way we calculate price. And as you all have heard me say for many years, I'm very proud of the fact that we are very conservative in terms of how we calculate price. It is not a same-store sales kind of number. It is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions, and the denominators are our entire book of business. So it includes contracts that perhaps we didn't touch certainly in the quarter for pricing. So having said that, there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag, if you will, in terms of the yield dollars that come from our pricing actions. But again, our focus is unchanged from what it's been at this point in time. We've got a couple of markets out there that are particularly challenging. But our commitment to driving value, driving quality service and driving positive pricing, positive volumes -- or positive margins has not changed."

We think Congress' desire to have the STB work through their workload. So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocals switching rules or the reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups. We're touching all the right points and making sure our perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There's a lot of moving parts there, so it's taking a fair amount of work on my part on our legal team and on our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be the kind of overriding overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered.

We don't make a prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward. But you got a believe all reasonable expectations are it's going to continue to remain strong. In order to change that, you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies. And there's just not a lot of catalysts that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult; however, even in today's world, you see, for instance, grain exporting off the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar. So market conditions can still prompt commodity movement and global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that, where a couple of years ago, people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive. And in today's world, they say, no, that's maybe more like $50 a barrel. So there's a lot of moving parts there. Clearly, we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy, which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports. That all would be really helpful to us."

Sales have been at record or near record levels, and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights. It's the amount of debt inherent and auto loans and leases. Actual sales incentives per car were at an all-time record level in the quarter, highest since 2008 was the previous record. So there is some cautionary signs out there.

We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn't all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows in a lot of different ways have that risk. Having said all of that, we do believe -- I do believe that the West Coast ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies that some of the West Coast ports are employing to make themselves more efficient with autonomous vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast port is still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future, though you will see people running through -- do risk mitigation strategies."

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products both down double digits. Agricultural Product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015, as grain shipments finally started to show some strength.
The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which is up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives, as well as positive core pricing, helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our 6 value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record Agricultural Products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets in a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy-related and international Intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid reinvestable returns even in these difficult markets and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume and the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and lifted grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter, as adverse weather in South America caused significant losses, elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grain products carloads advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments. Food and refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter, as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. 
Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles, impacting key Union Pacific-served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of 17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. On the parts side, a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume.
Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48% due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments, was up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however, overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16%, respectively, in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer-than-average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days, down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings, impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction Products volume was down 8% due to weather-impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic Intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown Service, domestic was nearly flat. International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continued to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory and the Hanjin bankruptcy.
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag Products, we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong, driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at 17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of 17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.
In Industrial Products, lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. We anticipate a softer year-end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. 
Finally, in Intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low 0.77.  Included in this was a record-low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. Although we continue to make significant improvements, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0 incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. 
Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a fluid network were somewhat offset by productivity gains, such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. 
Moving on to resources. As part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with the goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads.
As you know, we've been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year, with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We're adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.
Turning to network productivity. While we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran to all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter record.
Recrew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip, is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter recrew rate was 2.3%, a near-2-point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record.
As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident-free environment. And where growth opportunities arise, we'll leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,402444700,1057879,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in",1377,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. 
Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, an 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. Interest expense of $184 million was up 17% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.
Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. 
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but up $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter.
Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a competitive marketplace in a soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return-driven core pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year.
As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 6% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record $1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, which reduced car hire expense, and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year.
As we discussed back in September, we have written off the $13 million accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. In addition, we also incurred $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense, also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.
Turning to our operating ratio. The third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter.
Looking at cash flow. Cash from operations for the first 3 quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. For the full year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September.
Taking a look now at the balance sheet. Our all-in debt -- adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter-end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of over 1.9x, up from 1.7x at year-end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than 2x. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares, totaling about $2.2 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first 3 quarters of this year.
So that's a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits, and we still expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 + 0 initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible.
And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. 
From a productivity perspective, our G55 + 0 initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year, and we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvement well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 + 0 initiatives.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As the team has articulated here this morning, we continued to experience a difficult but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines, such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below 1 year ago. The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges: an unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods.
However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. The recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million BTU, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With a record harvest currently underway, we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our ag customers.
Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we'll continue to do what Union Pacific does best: operate a safe, efficient and productive network, while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.
With that, let's open up the line for your questions."

There have been 3 major mergers, 1 bankruptcy, there are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match-backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain, in particular, DDGs to China. We are continuing to look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. We're also really excited longer term or midterm in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf. And we think that that's going to be an excellent opportunity for match-backs also. So we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China, occasionally, as they have right now, has tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs; but we think, long term, that should be an opportunity for us."

So one of the things that we are really excited about is the great franchise we have, and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise, obviously, as we mentioned, the energy-related and the international-related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So we've been talking about the challenges in coal. Coal, as you know, has been greatly challenged not only by a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great -- a strong competitor to coal. The low -- below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We're excited -- or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that, that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal. But that has clearly had an impact. Likewise, the 3 major bankrupts -- or the 3 major mergers, the 1 large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at reinvestable returns.

I mean, it's -- we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume is going to trough, and that makes it difficult. So we are always kind of chasing, if you will.

You will see coal volumes grow. You will see the opportunity for coal pricing to grow. You will see inventories go down. And I think we'll be in a better place"

That's largely driven by their reauthorization from Congress about 1 year ago. In that reauthorization, Congress has essentially encouraged the STB to work through their docket. They had a backlog of a fair number of action items. Our concern is that, that's interpreted as a desire to regulate the industry further. We don't believe that is the desire of Congress. We think Congress' desire was to have the STB work through their workload. So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocals switching roles or the reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups. We're touching all the right points and making sure our perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There's a lot of moving parts there, so it's taking a fair amount of work on my part on our legal team and on our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be the kind of overriding overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered. And so we're also working hard to make sure that the STB takes into account the full perspective of everything they're working on and the knock-on impacts of each as a group. Does that makes sense?"

We don't make a prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward. But you got a believe all reasonable expectations are it's going to continue to remain strong. In order to change that, you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies. And there's just not a lot of catalysts that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult; however, even in today's world, you see, for instance, grain exporting off the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar. So market conditions can still prompt commodity movement in global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that, where a couple of years ago, people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive. And in today's world, they say, no, that's maybe more like $50 a barrel. So there's a lot of moving parts there. Clearly, we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy, which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports. That all would be really helpful to us."

And that's something that will happen across time. The big driver, as we've been saying, my view on the automotive side is the cautionary impact in terms of sales. Sales have been at record or near record levels, and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights. It's the amount of debt inherent in auto loans and leases. Actual sales incentives per car were at an all-time record level in the quarter, highest since 2008 was the previous record. So there is some cautionary signs out there. If auto sales stay strong, we have a great franchise and we're in a great spot. I do think there is some cautionary signs out there."

We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn't all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows in a lot of different ways have that risk. Having said all of that, we do believe -- I do believe that the West Coast ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies that some of the West Coast ports are employing to make themselves more efficient with autonomous vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast ports is still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future, though you will see people running to do risk mitigation strategies."

With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in 5 of our 6 commodity groups, with Coal and Industrial Products both down double digits. Agricultural Product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015, as grain shipments finally started to show some strength.
The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which is up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives, as well as positive core pricing, helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our 6 value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric."

In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record Agricultural Products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets in a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy-related and international Intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid reinvestable returns even in these difficult markets and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume and the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and lifted grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter, as adverse weather in South America caused significant losses, elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grain products carloads advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments. Food and refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter, as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. 
Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles, impacting key Union Pacific-served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of 17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. On the parts side, a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume.
Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48% due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments, was up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter.
Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however, overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16%, respectively, in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer-than-average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days, down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the 5-year average. 
Industrial Products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings, impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction Products volume was down 8% due to weather-impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing and increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. 
Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic Intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown Service, domestic was nearly flat. International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continued to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory and the Hanjin bankruptcy.
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag Products, we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong, driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at 17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of 17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. 
Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.
In Industrial Products, lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. We anticipate a softer year-end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. 
Finally, in Intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance."

Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low 0.77.  Included in this was a record-low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. Although we continue to make significant improvements, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0 incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. 
Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a fluid network were somewhat offset by productivity gains, such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. 
Moving on to resources. As part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with the goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads.
As you know, we've been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year, with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We're adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.
Turning to network productivity. While we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran to all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter record.
Recrew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew has insufficient time to complete the trip, is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter recrew rate was 2.3%, a near-2-point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record.
As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident-free environment. And where growth opportunities arise, we'll leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob."
310078,402444700,1058285,"Union Pacific Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Union Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in",1377,"Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. 
Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, an 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. Interest expense of $184 million was up 17% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.
Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. 
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but up $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter.
Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. 
Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a competitive marketplace in a soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return-driven core pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies and fewer people in the training pipeline. General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year.
As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. 
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 6% decline in gross ton-miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record $1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. 
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, which reduced car hire expense, and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year.
As we discussed back in September, we have written off the $13 million accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. In addition, we also incurred $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense, also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.
Turning to our operating ratio. The third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter.
Looking at cash flow. Cash from operations for the first 3 quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. For the full year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September.
Taking a look now at the balance sheet. Our all-in debt -- adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter-end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of over 1.9x, up from 1.7x at year-end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than 2x. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares, totaling about $2.2 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first 3 quarters of this year.
So that's a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits, and we still expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 + 0 initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible.
And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. 
From a productivity perspective, our G55 + 0 initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year, and we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvement well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019. And longer term, we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 + 0 initiatives.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance."

As the team has articulated here this morning, we continued to experience a difficult but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines, such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below 1 year ago. The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges: an unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods.
However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. The recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million BTU, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With a record harvest currently underway, we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our ag customers.
Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we'll continue to do what Union Pacific does best: operate a safe, efficient and productive network, while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.

In terms of the cost, we're confident that we are well-situated, both on locomotives and employees, to leverage the volume that we hope does materialize. So we've got fewer people in training line because we've got so many people, if you will, in furlough status at this point.

As you mentioned, Cherilyn, there's significant volatility going on in the international container ship business. There have been 3 major mergers, 1 bankruptcy, there are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match-backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain, in particular, DDGs to China. We are continuing to look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. We're also really excited longer term or midterm in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf. And we think that that's going to be an excellent opportunity for match-backs also. So we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China, occasionally, as they have right now, has tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs; but we think, long term, that should be an opportunity for us."

And some components of our franchise, obviously, as we mentioned, the energy-related and the international-related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So we've been talking about the challenges in coal. Coal, as you know, has been greatly challenged not only by a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great -- a strong competitor to coal. The low -- below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We're excited -- or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that, that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal. But that has clearly had an impact. Likewise, the 3 major bankrupts -- or the 3 major mergers, the 1 large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at reinvestable returns.

I mean, your comment is right that we have always said and we do believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of the lack of volume growth.

I mean, your comment is right that we have always said and we do believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of the lack of volume growth. And in fact, you look out over the last decade, we've taken almost 25 points off our operating ratio without the benefit of positive volume over that timeframe. I would say, you're exactly right, though. Here in the short term this year, I would say that the major driver of not likely improving the operating ratio this year is the pace of which we've been kind of chasing volume down. I mean, it's -- we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume is going to trough, and that makes it difficult. So we are always kind of chasing, if you will. And I think that's really the answer to what you've seen this year. So as we look forward, I think it's still a fair assumption and it's certainly our drive that we expect to make improvements in our operating ratio in spite of what the economy deals us in terms of what happens with volume. Now having said that, as we look out over the next several years, we do have volume in our thesis on the positive side of the ledger, but we're going to not use that as an excuse not to make continued productivity improvements."

It is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions, and the denominator is our entire book of business.

Anything from the chassis sorters that we've been hearing a little bit about, if that's a concern? Clearly, there's a lot of other puts and takes in the international intermodal side now."

At a high level on the day they went bankrupt, they roughly had about 100 ships on the -- in floats [ph] around the world, 40 owned, about 60 leased. And there are lots of issues in terms of what to do with all of the in-traffic flows. There was roughly, I think, $14 billion worth of goods in in-traffic flows, lots of issues about what to do with that. We had a fairly nominal number of boxes en route on our railroad, and we've been able to process all of those through. We probably have a couple of dozen left to process through from roughly probably a little over 1,000 on the day of bankruptcy. So we've navigated that fairly well. The -- there are issues out there in navigating the rest of that. And it is an issue for the industry and supply chain in terms of what to do with those boxes, both loaded and empty and boxes on chassis, what to do with those. And that's something that the industry is going to be struggling with to resolve. But for the Union Pacific side, we've navigated that fairly well."

We don't make a prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward. But you got a believe all reasonable expectations are it's going to continue to remain strong. In order to change that, you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies. And there's just not a lot of catalysts that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult; however, even in today's world, you see, for instance, grain exporting off the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar. So market conditions can still prompt commodity movement in global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that, where a couple of years ago, people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive. And in today's world, they say, no, that's maybe more like $50 a barrel. So there's a lot of moving parts there. Clearly, we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy, which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports. That all would be really helpful to us."

Actual sales incentives per car were at an all-time record level in the quarter, highest since 2008 was the previous record. So there is some cautionary signs out there.

We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn't all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows in a lot of different ways have that risk.
